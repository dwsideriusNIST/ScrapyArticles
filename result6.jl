Ethylene is usually obtained by steam cracking and thermal decomposition of ethane. These products are mixtures of ethylene (main component), un-cracked ethane and other hydrocarbons. Therefore, ethylene separation from the other hydrocarbons, especially ethane, is necessary. The pressure of gas mixture is about 2000\u00a0kPa and temperature of 298\u00a0K and ethylene mole fraction in gas phase is nearly about 0.5\u20130.6. Currently, this process is done by cryogenic distillation; but due to the small difference in ethylene and ethane volatility, it needs high pressure units. The relative volatility of the current system is 1.4 to 1.6 at temperature range of 224 to 295\u00a0K and a total pressure of 1 to 24.3\u00a0bar. Consequently, if traditional distillation is used, more than 70 theoretical plates are needed when polymer-grade ethylene is required. This is an energy consuming process that costs more than 70\u00a0% of overall ethylene purification process cost (Anson et al. ", "2008", "). The adsorption process seems to be the most attractive alternative because of the maturity of the technology, the development of adsorbent manufacturing, low cost and low energy consumption (but highly efficient) gas separation systems. However, adsorption equilibrium data are necessary information for designing a separation process on the basis of adsorption. With the presentation of new industrial adsorbents, it seems to be indispensable to find out their properties for separation systems. Commercial zeolites have been found to be extremely efficient for olefin/paraffin separations (Triebe et al. ", "1996", "; Grande et al. ", "2002", "; Mofarahi et al. ", "2005", "). Several groups have applied synthetic commercial zeolites to the separation of ethylene/ethane. Bezus et\u00a0al.

However, none of these processes has confirmed to be a practical alternative to the old processes such as cryogenic distillation.", "Zeolite 5A is commonly used for gas separation by size exclusion.

The adsorption equilibrium isotherms were measured for pure ethylene, ethane and their binary mixture (20\u00a0%, 50\u00a0%, and 80\u00a0%) of ethylene at temperature of 283, 303 and 323\u00a0K and pressure of 0 to 950\u00a0kPa. The total amount of adsorbed ethylene and ethane mixture was directly measured in the experiments, and the individual adsorbed amount of each component was predicted by thermodynamic modeling. Model constants of VST are determined by pure adsorption isotherms and then applied to predict adsorption of mixtures. One can obtain individual adsorption amounts of components in the mixture as well as ethylene selectivity using the model prediction. Then, the influence of temperature, pressure, and composition in gas phase on selectivity will be discussed. Furthermore, the isosteric heats of adsorption of ethylene and ethane over zeolite 5A were estimated and compared. Also, the thermodynamic consistency tests between pure and binary gas adsorption systems were discussed.", "2 ", "Theory", "To quantify single-component adsorption equilibria, vacancy solution theory is considered in this work.

It consists of an adsorption cell, a loading cell, a circulation pump and a volumetric system to introduce and measure the gases admitted in the circuit. The loading and adsorption cell, circulation pump and all connections are all made up of stainless steel. The total amount of gas introduced into the system is measured by appropriate pressure, temperature, and volume. The temperature uncertainty of the thermocouple is \u00b10.1\u00a0K. the pressure uncertainty of the pressure transmitter is \u00b10.05\u00a0kPa. The temperature and pressure were recorded at constant intervals with a recorder (Logoscreen 50, Jumo). During measurement, the adsorption cell was immersed in a water bath (MC 12, Julabo Tech.) where the temperature was maintained at \u00b10.02\u00a0K via a refrigeration circulator. The volumes of the adsorption cell, loading cell, and dead volumes were measured using helium gas. A\u00a0vacuum pump was used to remove gaseous impurities from the system.

After reaching equilibrium the common pressure and temperature were recorded.

Temperatures and pressures before and after the adsorption equilibrium state were recorded. The experiment was conducted, on a continuous basis, at pressures up to 950\u00a0kPa. During the experiments a circulation pump was used for gas mixing and circulating. The amount of adsorbed gas was calculated, from the temperature and pressure, before and after the adsorption equilibrium state using a mass balance. This balance was derived from the generalized equation of state before and after adsorption equilibrium. Those measurements are cited elsewhere (Mofarahi and Seyyedi ", "2009", "). The measurements were repeated several times for each isotherm in order to verify the data accuracy.", "4 ", "Result and discussion", "Pure adsorption isotherm", "Adsorption isotherms of pure ethylene and ethane measured at three temperatures (283, 303 and 323\u00a0K) are presented in Tables\u00a0", "2", " and\u00a0", "3", ", respectively. The adsorption isotherm data were well correlated by the VST model. The correlated parameters and error of analysis are given in Tables\u00a0", "4", " and\u00a0", "5", ". The results in Tables\u00a0", "4", " and\u00a0", "5", " illustrate good capability of the VST model to describe the pure ethylene and ethane isotherms. Correlation results of modeling show that the obtained average error (AAD %) is less than 7\u00a0% for pure ethylene and less than 11\u00a0% for pure ethane. A\u00a0comparison of the experimental data with the correlation results for pure ethylene and ethane adsorption isotherms is illustrated in Figs.\u00a0", "1", " and\u00a0", "2", ", respectively. As can be observed, some deviations between experimental data and correlation results are seen especially in high pressures. These figures show that the equilibrium loading on zeolite 5A on ethylene is higher than ethane at all temperatures. In particular, this difference is much higher at low temperatures. Also, the curve for ethylene is more rectangular shaped than the curve for ethane, indicating a stronger interaction between ethylene and zeolite 5A than between ethane and zeolite 5A. Corresponding to the Brunauer classification of isotherms, ethane and ethylene isotherms closely resemble to type\u00a0I isotherms. Physical monolayer adsorption of the type\u00a0I isotherms occurs in microporous materials where the saturation limit corresponds to complete filling of the micropores. In other words, pore sizes of zeolite particles are not much larger than the molecular diameter of the adsorbate (the kinetic diameter of ethylene and ethane is 4.163 & 4.443\u00a0\u00c5, respectively) (Yang ", "1986", "). This shows that the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions are more significant than adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. The ethylene and ethane adsorption capacity of zeolite 5A reveal most of its swing capacity in the pressure region of 1 to 250\u00a0kPa. At this point, the comparison of different adsorbents can be discussed. Zeolite 5A has more adsorption swing capacity for ethylene than the other interesting adsorbents such as ETS-10 (Al-Baghli and Loughlin ", "2005", "; Shi et al. ", "2010", ") and ETS-4 (Anson et al. ", "2010", ") with different cation structures. The adsorption swing capacity of zeolite 5A for ethylene was more similar to adsorbents such as zeolite 4A (Perez and Armenta ", "2010", ") and 13X (Danner and Choi ", "1978", "). It is also important to mention that high capacity for the desired component is an important asset in olefin/paraffin separations by PSA processes.

This trend has been experimentally verified by Al-Baghli and Loughlin (", "2006", "). It seems quadrupole interactions play an important role at high pressures because of the great difference in ethylene (0.48\u00a0\u00c5", "3", ") and ethane (0.27\u00a0\u00c5", "3", ") quadrupole moment.

An excellent fit has been obtained using the VST model for pure adsorption data. The correlated pure component parameters were appropriately applied to predict binary adsorption data. The binary adsorption errors obtained from the predictions are less than 7\u00a0% in all cases. The isosteric heat of adsorption was estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and pure component data. The adsorption selectivity was predicted using pure component adsorption isotherm data and the VST model. At a fixed pressure and temperature, prediction results show that ethylene selectivity increases when the ethylene composition of the gas phase decreases. It also indicated that selectivity increases with pressure. Furthermore, prediction results show that the lower the temperature at a specified pressure, the greater the ethylene separation by zeolite 5A. Given its high adsorption capacity and reasonable selectivity for ethylene in comparisons with other remarkable adsorbents, zeolite 5A can be used for ethylene/ethane separation by adsorption technology especially in pressure swing adsorption processes. Finally, a thermodynamic consistency test was performed for binary data adsorption accuracy and shows adequate accuracy of the data."], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\"><a

An error in the isotherm parameters can cause a large error in the multicomponent computations (Do ", "1998", "). Thus, in the first step, a reasonable and accurate isotherm data should be selected or estimated. For zeolite 4A, Grande et al.

They reported the propane isotherm much less than the amount measured by Grande et al. On the other hand, Granato et al. (", "2007a", ") utilized molecular simulations to calculate the pure and binary adsorption equilibria of propane and propylene over 4A zeolite. Their simulation results are in good agreement with the data of Grande et al. (", "2003", "). So, comparison of the data reveals that the data of Jarvelin and Fair (", "1993", ") was probably taken in non-equilibrium conditions because of the kinetic nature of propane adsorption on 4A.", "Propane equilibrium adsorptions on Si-CHA and ITQ-3 zeolites have not been reported yet. The only data is the uptake rate measurement of propane at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and 600 torr which is available from the work of Olson et al. (", "2004", "). It means that, even with the assumption of equilibrium at the end of the uptake rate experiments, only one point of equilibrium adsorption does exist, at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and 600 torr. This one point is not adequate for obtaining the isotherm model. Thus, only Langmuir affinity parameter (b) can be taken if the saturation adsorption capacity of propane is known. In this regard, as the saturation adsorption capacity of propene is known and also propene and propane liquid densities at high pressures are almost the same, saturation adsorption capacity of propane is assumed to have the same value that reported for propene. Therefore, the values presented in Table\u00a0", "1", " for Si-CHA and ITQ-3 zeolite are estimated on the base of the above assumptions.", "According to Table\u00a0", "3", ", all 13X zeolites are commercial adsorbents having some extent of binder. In some references, the amount of the binder has not been reported. But, from the literature data and the published patents, it seems that both Union Carbide and CECA use 20\u00a0% binder in the fabrication of extruded zeolite adsorbents (Plee and Methivier ", "2008", "; Bouvier et al.

Although a number of frameworks are available for describing the adsorption phenomenon, the Ono\u2013Kondo (OK) lattice model offers several practical advantages in modeling supercritical, high-pressure adsorption systems. In a recent work, a generalized Ono\u2013Kondo model was developed for predicting pure-gas adsorption on activated carbons and coals. The goal of the present work is to utilize the pure-component, generalized OK model to predict, a priori, the mixture adsorption of coalbed gases.

In addition, the ultimate correlative capabilities of the OK model for mixed-gas adsorption were also investigated by using binary interaction parameters.Traditional modeling of mixed-gas adsorption typically involves the equilibrium gas-phase mole fractions as required model input. However, the experimental gas-phase molar fractions are generally not available for coalbed reservoir simulation studies.

The authors evaluated the Ono-Kondo (OK) lattice model for correlating high-pressure, supercrit. adsorption encountered in CBM recovery and CO2 sequestration.  Specifically, the parameters of the OK model were optimized to obtain reliable representation of pure-gas adsorption on carbon adsorbents.  The results were used to develop generalized model parameters, expressed in terms of gas properties and adsorbent characterization which include the temp. dependence of the OK model parameters.

The generalized model can predict the adsorption isotherms on activated carbon with \u223c7%AAD.

The model allows one to describe the adsorption behavior of mols. at a surface (or interface), and the phase behavior of adsorbed mols., and of mols. in the bulk from short-range ordering in 2 and 3 dimensions.  While there are prior lattice theories that predict nonrandom behavior for arbitrary lattice coordination nos., the derivation of adsorption models from these theories is usually based on ideal fluid behavior in the bulk.  However, the new adsorption model presented here is consistent in that mol. behavior in the bulk as well as in the adsorbed surface layer is based on identical assumptions.  This is accomplished by calcg. the total free energy of the system; the corresponding adsorption model follows through minimization of the free energy.  This procedure is also used for deriving a new adsorption equation based on the quasi-chem. approxn. to the Ising problem.  Results from this equation are very similar to those obtained from the equation based on Ono-Kondo theory.

The newly developed generalized model is capable of predicting the adsorption of pure and mixed gases on coals within three times the expected exptl. uncertainties, on av.  The model was further validated by comparison with an external data set comprised of CO2 adsorption isotherms on 27 diverse coals.  Results indicate that, on av., the SLD-PR generalized model provided a priori predictions of the CO2 adsorption data on the 27 coals with an av. abs. percent deviation of 12%, based solely on coal characterization information for these coals.

The system was used to measure CO2-induced swelling in three Australian bituminous coals at temps. between 25 and 55\u00b0 and pressures up to 15 MPa.  All three coals showed similar behavior, with swelling increasing as a function of pressure up to \u223c8 to 10 MPa, after which no further increase in swelling was obsd.  The max. volumetric swelling was between \u223c1.7 and 1.9%, even in liq. CO2.  Significant anisotropy was obsd.; swelling in the plane perpendicular to the bedding plane was always substantially higher than in the parallel plane.  The swelling in these coals was completely reversible with each sample returning to its original dimensions after the gas was removed, even after multiple exposures.  Temp. did not directly affect the max. amt. of swelling, however, the swelling tended to occur at lower pressures with decreasing temp.  Expressing the swelling as a function of gas d. rather than gas pressure showed that swelling was independent of temp.; in all cases the swelling curves were identical.  Swelling could be well represented by a modified Dubinin-Radushkevich model which was used previously to describe gas adsorption on coal.  Volumetric swelling data for two of the coals were combined with gas adsorption results previously measured for these coals.  Swelling was roughly proportional to the amt. of CO2 adsorbed up to intermediate pressures, but at high pressures, the relation was no longer linear; adsorption continued to increase but swelling did not.  The swelling data were used to correct the adsorption isotherm measured for these coals, assuming that the vol. occupied by the coal was inaccessible to gas and increased in proportion to volumetric swelling.  At pressures up to \u223c5 MPa, the effect of correction for swelling on the adsorption value was negligible but at higher pressures, the vol. changes due to the swelling of the coal resulted in an increased measured excess adsorption.  At 15 MPa the cor. excess sorption was \u223c30% greater than the uncorrected value.  Correction for swelling had little effect on the calcd. sorption capacity of the coal or the heat of sorption (using the modified Dubinin-Radushkevich equation) but had strong effects on the term representing dissoln. of carbon dioxide into the coal.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhs1Krtrc%253D&md5=3a916bfde88021a560fe8784c79fc1bd", "25.

Importantly, the parent framework [Zn", "2", "(bdc)", "2", "(dabco)]", "n", " exhibits intrinsic structural flexibility due to the integrated paddle-wheel building unit. Via implementation of bdc-type linkers, which are substituted with flexible side chains of a specific size regime, a \u201cbreathing\u201d behavior in response to adsorbed guest molecules (DMF, CO", "2", ") can be triggered in this type of networks, while other molecules such as N", "2", " are barely adsorbed and do not trigger the structural transitions. Upon guest removal the frameworks contract and transfer from a large pore to a narrow pore form, exhibiting a drastically reduced cell volume. Remarkably, the substitution pattern of the linker and also the bulkiness and chemical nature of the substituents affect the structure of the narrow pore phase and thus the responsive behavior of the framework. If the linker is substituted in position 2 and 3 the structural flexibility of the respective pillared-layered MOF is drastically reduced, when compared to the corresponding 2,5-disubstituted derivatives. Substituents that are sterically less demanding and/or possess functionalities with a stronger interaction potential provoke a more drastic contraction of the framework. Hence, the degree of contraction in the responsive pillared-layered MOFs can be systematically varied from 86% to 72% of the initial volume depending on the utilized substituents.", "These structural differences of the contracted, guest-free materials drastically influence their gas sorption properties. The networks hardly adsorb N", "2", ", whereas CO", "2", " is adsorbed in a stepwise fashion. Notably, the detailed shape of the CO", "2", " isotherm (e.g., transition pressure, width of the hysteresis) is substantially affected by the nature of the implemented substituent, pointing out the huge potential for a fine-tuning of such properties for desired applications in sensing and separation by specific design of the linker.", "Moreover, combining our variably functionalized linkers with the concept of MOF solid solutions offers very rich additional dimensions of tailoring the structural dynamics and responsiveness. Implementation of two differently functionalized linkers in varying ratios next to each other yields MOF \u201ccopolymers\u201d of increased inherent complexity, which show a non-linear dependence of their gas sorption properties on the applied ratio of components. We think that our methodology is in principle transferable to a wide variety of other MOF systems and may allow to implement and to tune such responsive properties in other network families.

Subsequent sections discuss specific examples of MOF sensors, categorized by method of signal transduction.  Sensors based on MOF photoluminescence are discussed briefly.  The authors have limited the review of luminescence-based sensors to a small no. of recent reports where the porous MOF architecture, or its chem. compn., imparts selective sensing capabilities.  Scintillating MOFs that luminesce in the presence of radioactive analytes are also discussed.  Other signal transduction schemes that use photons include various kinds of optical interferometry, analyte modulation of localized surface plasmon resonance energies, and solvatochromism.

The field of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), which are often also called porous coordination polymers (PCPs), has been growing tremendously over the last 15 years.  This fascinating class of cryst. hybrid materials, which are formed by assocn. of metal centers or clusters and org. linker(s), offers a unique chem. versatility combined with a designable framework and an unprecedentedly large and permanent inner porosity.  In this review, MOF thin films will be examd. with respect to three main themes.  Fabrication methods are important and will be described in the first section.  Characterization, which ranges from compositional and structural identification to lateral homogeneity and porosity, is an important issue that will be discussed together with various strategies aimed at improving the quality and applicability of films.
