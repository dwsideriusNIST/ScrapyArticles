Thus, the shift in transition pressure is rather related to an activated and structural effect that occurs at higher degree of pore filling than to an intrinsic difference in adsorption enthalpy between the outer layers and the bulk of the material. A larger pressure might be needed to allow a permanent reorientation of the linkers in the outer cages of the material to allow accommodation of more molecules per cage. As soon as the HL state is reached in the outer layers, a further transition from the LL state to the HL state in the bulk of the crystal might then be facilitated.

Although the equilibration times demonstrate that the uptake of ", "n", "-butanol by the ZIF-8 material is an extremely slow process, the differences between the various crystal sizes are much smaller than expected. When the uptake is controlled by diffusion into the pore network in the bulk of the crystals, the adsorption time varies with the square of the crystal size, while for the case of a surface barrier limitation they are directly proportional to the size itself (eqs S5 and S6, ", "Supporting Information", "). Intriguingly, both the diffusion and the barrier resistance cases are still faster than the observed tendency. Furthermore, the uptake curve, plotted versus square root of time scale (", "Figure ", "8", ", right), follows a straight line through the origin for the large crystals, while the small ones exhibit sigmoidal uptake curves. These curve shapes are typically the expression of a (pore network) diffusion limited uptake and a surface barrier limited uptake, respectively. The 0.47 \u03bcm ZIF-8 exhibits a lower uptake rate than 0.73 \u03bcm ZIF-8 (", "Figure S11", "). This sample has a cubic crystal morphology and exposes the {100} facets, while all other samples have a rhombic dodecahedron morphology and expose the {110} facets. The 0.47 \u03bcm ZIF-8 sample also shows a different lattice strain as compared to the other samples (", "Figure S4", "). A different distribution of 4- and 6-ring windows, giving access to the SOD cages, in the {110} or {111} facets could result in different uptake rates (", "Figure S12", "),", "(54)", " but this aspect needs further research. These observations may suggest that the governing mass transfer resistance changes with crystal size and morphology.", "Figure 8.

Other crystal sizes are provided in ", "Figure S11", ".", "In order to quantify the uptake rate and identify the governing mass transfer resistance, the conventional analysis consists to fit single-resistance models on the experimental data (eqs S5 and S6, ", "Supporting Information", "). It is, moreover, common practice to approximate the crystal shape by a sphere. The validity of this approximation is proven in the literature.", "(49)", " The fitting of the intracrystalline (pore network) diffusion model and the surface barrier model on the experimental uptake curves is provided in ", "Figure S13", ". ", "Figure S13a", " shows that the uptake curve of the large crystals (88 \u03bcm) is well approached by the intracrystalline (pore network) diffusion model, while crystal downsizing leads to uptake curves that are better described by the surface resistance model (", "Figure S13b\u2013g", "). This indicates that both intracrystalline and surface resistances govern the overall mass transfer rate, with their relative contribution changing with crystals size. Although it would be very tempting to fit a dual resistances model on the uptake curves, such a fit, without the precise knowledge of one of the two resistances, is highly susceptible to a large uncertainty. Consequently, further analysis was limited to apparent diffusivities and surface permeabilities obtained from the fitting of single-resistance models (", "eqs S5 and S6", ") on the experimental uptake curves (", "Figure S13", ").", "It may be noticed, from ", "Figure ", "9", ", that both parameters are clearly affected by the crystal size. In a diffusion control regime, the apparent diffusivities are expected to be independent of the crystal size, whereas a dramatic variation of up to 5 orders of magnitude occurs with crystal downsizing. As a consequence, the apparent diffusivity obtained with the largest crystals is only an under limit of the intracrystalline diffusivity of the ", "n", "-butanol into the ZIF-8 pore network.", "The pronounced decrease in apparent diffusivity with crystal size, as shown in ", "Figure ", "9", ", may be attributed to an increase of the contribution of the surface resistance to the overall mass transfer resistance. This can be clearly viewed from the relationship of the apparent diffusivity\u2014which lumps the two resistances together\u2014with the intracrystalline (pore network) diffusivity and the surface permeability (see ", "Supporting Information", " for more details):", "(4)", "Assuming the diffusivity ", "D", " and the surface permeability \u03b1 are constant for the material at various crystal sizes, an increase in crystal size ", "R", "c", " will ineluctably reduce the contribution of the surface permeability, such that the apparent diffusivity will become equal to the intracrystalline (pore network) diffusivity and independent of the crystal size. In the opposite case, the contribution of the surface resistance to the overall mass transfer resistance increases with crystal downsizing, resulting in apparent diffusivities that are proportional to the crystal size. Although they seem to follow the latter regime (surface barrier control), the apparent diffusivities decrease more strongly than simply being proportional to the crystal size, which is also supported by the continuous decrease of the apparent surface permeability (", "Figure ", "9", "). Two explanations can be given to describe this effect. First, studying the uptake batch wise may result in superposed crystals (i.e., perfectly ordered packing) that behave similarly as agglomerated crystals. The crystal size may then not represent the true particle size, resulting in an underestimation of the uptake rate constant. However, the crystal packing seems rather to be a random process, shown in ", "Figure ", "1", ", which also indicates the high crystal quality of our samples. It is therefore questionable if this may produce the rather systematic difference between the apparent diffusivities and its theoretical variation with crystal size (", "Figure ", "9", "). Second, besides a simple increase of the contribution of the surface resistance to the overall mass transfer rate, here given by the apparent diffusivity, the crystal downsizing may also come along with an increase of the governing resistances. This appears more likely to be caused by an increased surface resistance rather than a decreased intracrystalline (pore network) diffusivity. The origin of this behavior remains unclear and should definitely be investigated further, but it is already worth to speculate that it might be related to the aforementioned effect of the crystal size on the adsorption equilibrium. Given the fact that linker reorientation is needed to allow entrance of ", "n", "-butanol in the ZIF-8 cages, it would be instrumental to study linker twisting flexibility in both the outer and inner cages of the crystals.", "Figure 9.

Interestingly, diffusivities were obtained using different crystal sizes for the different molecules, ranging from 0.026 to 324 \u03bcm, without verifying the effect of crystal size.

The exptl. steaming method allows for high throughput screening of materials stability over a broad range of steam levels as well as in-depth investigation of structural transformations under more highly resolved conditions, while the cluster model presented here yields the correct trends in hydrothermal stability.  Good agreement was obsd. between predicted relative stabilities of materials by mol. modeling and exptl. results.  Fundamental information from these studies has provided insight into how metal compn. and coordination, chem. functionality of org. linker, framework dimensionality, and interpenetration affect the relative stabilities of PCP materials.  This work suggests that the strength of the bond between the metal oxide cluster and the bridging linker is important in detg. the hydrothermal stability of the PCP.  Although the flexibility of the framework plays a role, it is not as important as the metal-linker bond strength.

Topol. mapping of the potential-energy surfaces makes it possible to relate the preferential adsorption sites, Henry const., and isosteric heats of adsorption at zero coverage to the nature of the host-guest interactions and the chem. nature of the org. linker.

In summary, by applying pressure to ZIF-8 the hydrostatic medium can be forced to enter the pore, initially increasing the vol. of both the nanopore and the unit cell.  On increasing pressure further, more solvent can be forced into the nanopore, even though the nanopore vol. decreases, until the sample undergoes a phase transition.  This transition not only allows more solvent to enter the original nanopore, but it increases the size of the narrow channels that connect these pores, resulting in an overall increase in porous vol. and amt. of sequestered solvent.  Modification of the pore vol., size, shape, and therefore selectivity has thus been achieved on application of pressure.

The observed rise in the breadths of the high angle lines from annealed materials suggests that some dislocations remain after annealing.

N-deuteration greatly simplifies the resonance Raman spectra for all of these species.  The deutero cations have only one strongly enhanced Raman band.  This change in no. of active vibrations is interpreted in terms of a change in the form of the ground electronic state normal modes of motion.  The ground-state equil. geometry and vibrational force field are calcd. at the 6-31++G** Hartree-Fock level for imidazole and imidazolium.  The low-lying excited electronic states are calcd. at the ground-state equil. geometry with CI involving singly excited states.  A single state is expected to dominate the absorption and Raman spectral intensities.  The equil. geometry of this state for imidazole and imidazolium at the 6-31+G/CIS level is calcd. and expressed in terms of the displacement along each of the ground-state modes for each isotopic species.  This ab initio procedure correctly predicts the intensity of the strongly enhanced normal modes of the neutral and cationic species including the large change in intensity obsd. with isotope exchange.  It is found that the effect of replacement of N-H by N-D in the cation is to leave one of the two strong modes of the proto species the same in the d2 species while the other active mode of the proto form becomes distributed among several modes in the deuterated species such that none has a significant displacement upon excitation and thus has a low Raman intensity.

Both expts. and simulations show strong inflection characteristics in the adsorption isotherms.  The primary cause of the inflection is due to the strong preference for adsorption within, and in the regions close to the mouths of tetrahedral pockets.  The isotherm inflection has a significant influence on the dependence of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity, D, on the fractional occupancy, Di.  Both IRM expts. and simulations show that the Di-\u03b8i behavior appears to be influenced by the loading dependence of the inverse thermodn. factor 1/\u0393i = dln\u03b8i/dlnpi.  For nC4 and iC4, the Di increase sharply by about one order of magnitude as the occupancy \u03b8i increases from 0 to about 0.2.  This increase is caused by the fact that the diffusion characteristics undergo a transition from being dominated by hops across narrow 4.6 \u00c5 windows at low loadings to hops across large 9 \u00c5 windows for loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell.  For loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell the Di-\u03b8i dependence of nC4 and iC4 is dictated by 1/\u0393i, characteristic of more open channel structures such as FAU zeolite.

We provide a crit. review of the possibilities of exploring diffusion phenomena over microscopic dimensions in such media by direct exptl. observation.  By monitoring the probability distribution of mol. displacements as a function of time, the pulsed field gradient technique of NMR (PFG NMR) records the rate of mol. re-distribution.  By varying the observation time, PFG NMR is thus able to trace even hierarchies of transport resistances as occurring, e.g., in catalyst particles in the form of binder-compacted assemblages of zeolite crystallites.  Alternatively, and complementary to this information, interference microscopy (IFM) and IR microscopy (IRM) are able to follow the evolution of intracryst. concn. profiles during uptake and release.  This allows, in particular, an accurate quantification of the transport resistances on the surface of the individual crystallites and of the probability that reactant mols. from the gas phase, upon colliding with the external surface, are able to penetrate through such \"surface barriers\" into the crystal bulk phase.

Most of the primary data were already published sep. but are revisited here, complemented with new data and discussed together as a mini-review on the diffusion characteristics.  The range of the reported diffusivities covers six orders of magnitude.  This study was only possible owing to the particularly wide range of crystal sizes, from 20 up to 300 \u03bcm, available for the diffusion expts.

The self-diffusion coeffs. of carbon dioxide measured by PFG NMR are found to be independent of loading.  They are in good agreement with results from mol. dynamic (MD) simulations and resume the trend previously found by IR microscopy at lower loadings.
