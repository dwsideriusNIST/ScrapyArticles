The isotherm derived porosity parameters for each sample (see Table ", "1", ") reveal remarkable retention of surface area and micropore volume of more than 60% at mild annealing conditions. Interestingly, up to 30% porosity is still retained even at harsh annealing conditions, before complete framework decomposition at 500 \u00b0C (1 h) to produce ZnO embedded carbon.

The other notable observation is that some of the annealed samples show even higher total pore volumes than the initial MOF-5. The retention or improvement over the high pore volume of MOF-5 is in line with a vacancy defect-induced enhancement. Furthermore, the reduced specific surface area and the micropore volume indicate partial collapse of the local pore structure due to decomposition of the linker carboxylates.

Compared to conventionally used microporous inorg. materials such as zeolites, these org. structures have the potential for more flexible rational design, through control of the architecture and functionalization of the pores.  So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.

Uncontrolled massive release of the primary greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) into atm. from anthropogenic activities poses a big threat and adversely affects our global climate and natural environment.  One promising approach to mitigate CO2 emission is carbon capture and storage (CCS), in which ideal adsorbent materials with high storage capacity and excellent adsorption selectivity over other gases are urgently needed.  For practical applications in CO2 capture from flue gas of power plants, the biggest single contributor of anthropogenic CO2 emission, the adsorbent materials must also be chem. stable, be easy to regenerate with minimal energy input, and be easily synthesized with low capital cost.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), highly cryst. porous materials constructed by metal ions and org. ligands, have emerged as a class of excellent adsorbent materials for carbon capture.  Great progress in MOF materials for CO2 capture has been made in the past and reviewed accordingly, but new discoveries are constantly being made as the field quickly grows.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous materials with many potential applications, which intimately depend on the presence of chem. functionality either at the org. linkers and/or at the metal nodes.  Functionality that cannot be introduced into MOFs directly via de novo syntheses can be accessed through post-synthesis modification (PSM) on the reactive moieties of the linkers and/or nodes without disrupting the metal-linker bonds.  Even more intriguing methods that go beyond PSM are herein termed building block replacement (BBR) which encompasses (i) solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE), (ii) nonbridging ligand replacement, and (iii) transmetalation.  These 1-step or tandem BBR processes involve exchanging key structural components of the MOF, which in turn should allow for the evolution of protoMOF structures (i.e., the use of a parent MOF as a template) to design MOFs composed of completely new components, presumably via single crystal to single crystal transformations.

In its perfect crystal structure, each Zr metal center is fully coordinated by 12 org. linkers to form a highly connected framework.  Using high-resoln. neutron power diffraction technique, we found the first direct structural evidence showing that real UiO-66 material contains significant amt. of missing-linker defects, an unusual phenomenon for MOFs.  The concn. of the missing-linker defects is surprisingly high, \u223c10% in our sample, effectively reducing the framework connection from 12 to \u223c11.  We show that by varying the concn. of the acetic acid modulator and the synthesis time, the linker vacancies can be tuned systematically, leading to dramatically enhanced porosity.  We obtained samples with pore vols. ranging from 0.44 to 1.0 cm3/g and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas ranging from 1000 to 1600 m2/g, the largest values of which are \u223c150% and \u223c60% higher than the theor. values of defect-free UiO-66 crystal, resp.  The linker vacancies also have profound effects on the gas adsorption behaviors of UiO-66, in particular CO2.  Finally, comparing the gas adsorption of hydroxylated and dehydroxylated UiO-66, we found that the former performs systematically better than the latter (particularly for CO2) suggesting the beneficial effect of the -OH groups.  This finding is of great importance because hydroxylated UiO-66 is the practically more relevant, non-air-sensitive form of this MOF.

The focal point of this report is the pitfalls related to the MOF-5 phase identification based on powder XRD data.  A broad set of conditions and procedures have been reported for MOF-5 synthesis.  These variations have led to materials with substantially different adsorption properties (sp. surface areas in the range 700 to 3400 m2/g).  The relatively low wt. loss obsd. for some as synthesized samples upon solvent removal is also indicative of a low pore vol.  Regrettably, these materials have all been described as MOF-5 without any further comments.  Furthermore, the reported powder XRD patterns hint at structural differences: The variations in surface area are accompanied by peak splitting phenomena and rather pronounced changes in the relative peak intensities in the powder XRD patterns.  In this work, we use single-crystal XRD to investigate structural differences between low and high surface area MOF-5.  The low surface area MOF-5 sample had two different classes of crystals.  For the dominant phase, Zn(OH)2 species partly occupied the cavities.  The presence of Zn species makes the hosting cavity and possibly also adjacent cavities inaccessible and thus efficiently reduces the pore vol. of the material.  Furthermore, the minor phase consisted of doubly interpenetrated MOF-5 networks, which lowers the adsorption capacity.  The presence of Zn species and lattice interpenetration changes the symmetry from cubic to trigonal and explains the peak splitting obsd. in the powder XRD patterns.  Pore-filling effects from the Zn species (and partly the solvent mols.) are also responsible for the pronounced variations in powder XRD peak intensities.  This latter conclusion is particularly useful for predicting the adsorption properties of a MOF-5-type material from powder XRD.

N2 uptake of 44.5 mmol/g and a BET surface area of 3800 m2/g, compared to the 35.8 mmol/g and 3100 m2/g obtained for a sample prepd. using previous methods.  High-pressure H2 adsorption isotherms show improvements from 5.0 to 7.1 excess wt. % at 77 K and 40 bar.  The total H2 uptake was further obsd. to climb to 11.5% at 170 bar, corresponding to a volumetric storage d. of 77 g/L.  Thus, the air-free compd. exhibits the highest gravimetric and volumetric H2 uptake capacities yet demonstrated for a cryogenic hydrogen storage material.  Also, no loss of capacity was apparent during 24 complete adsorption-desorption cycles, while kinetics measurements showed a loading time of 2 min with application of just 45 bar of pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXht1CrurvF&md5=225d78a759d3f213ea51beff7a7f784e", "45.
