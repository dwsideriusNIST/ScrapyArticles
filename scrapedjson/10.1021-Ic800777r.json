So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.

The focal point of this report is the pitfalls related to the MOF-5 phase identification based on powder XRD data.  A broad set of conditions and procedures have been reported for MOF-5 synthesis.  These variations have led to materials with substantially different adsorption properties (sp. surface areas in the range 700 to 3400 m2/g).  The relatively low wt. loss obsd. for some as synthesized samples upon solvent removal is also indicative of a low pore vol.  Regrettably, these materials have all been described as MOF-5 without any further comments.  Furthermore, the reported powder XRD patterns hint at structural differences: The variations in surface area are accompanied by peak splitting phenomena and rather pronounced changes in the relative peak intensities in the powder XRD patterns.  In this work, we use single-crystal XRD to investigate structural differences between low and high surface area MOF-5.  The low surface area MOF-5 sample had two different classes of crystals.  For the dominant phase, Zn(OH)2 species partly occupied the cavities.  The presence of Zn species makes the hosting cavity and possibly also adjacent cavities inaccessible and thus efficiently reduces the pore vol. of the material.  Furthermore, the minor phase consisted of doubly interpenetrated MOF-5 networks, which lowers the adsorption capacity.  The presence of Zn species and lattice interpenetration changes the symmetry from cubic to trigonal and explains the peak splitting obsd. in the powder XRD patterns.  Pore-filling effects from the Zn species (and partly the solvent mols.) are also responsible for the pronounced variations in powder XRD peak intensities.  This latter conclusion is particularly useful for predicting the adsorption properties of a MOF-5-type material from powder XRD.

In each complex the ligand is deprotonated giving neutral species with 1:1 stoichiometry that form three-dimensional coordination polymers.  Supramol. isomerism (polymorphism) in 1 and 2 arises from the different ligand connectivity around the octahedral Co(II) centers.  The two coordinated H2O mols. in 1 occupy cis positions, which are trans to the chelating bipyridine N atoms, leaving the carboxylate O atoms in axial trans positions.  In 2 all like donors occupy cis positions.  Different modes of carboxylate coordination in 1 and 2 give dissimilar network topologies.  A rare example of two interpenetrating 6482-b (quartz-like) chiral networks in 1 results from both dcbp carboxylate groups coordinating in a monodentate fashion to adjacent Co(II) centers, whereas in 2 only one carboxylate group bridges between adjacent Co(II) centers giving rise to a single chiral (10,3)-a net.  In 1 and 2 the coordinated H2O mols. H bond to the noncoordinated carboxylate O atoms.  These interactions give rise to H2O-carboxylate double helixes in 1, and support the coordination network in 2.

Compd. 3 is isomorphous with 1 and likewise features two chiral interpenetrating nets of quartz topol.  In 4, chelating bipyridine N atoms and four carboxylate O atoms from a total of five adjacent dcbp ligands provide distorted octahedral geometry around Mn(II).  The carboxylate groups bridge adjacent Mn(II) centers to produce bis-carboxylato chains which cross-link and generate a 3-dimensional network that is perforated with channels.  The channels are occupied with disordered DEF mols.  The network topol. in 4 is quite different to 1-3 and has a (4.62)(42.6)(43.66.86) Schlaefli notation.  Magnetic susceptibility studies performed on 1, 2, {[Mn(dcbp)]\u00b70.5DMF} 5 and {[Mn(dcbp)]\u00b72H2O} 6 reveal very weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the metal centers in each case.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2cXovFOhsrk%253D&md5=79b44b367d72746155eac2fff0502450", " ", " (b)  ", "Tong", ", ", "M.
