In general, their energetic relations can be described as enantiotropic or monotropic. If they are related by enantiotropism, the free energy temperature curves cross at the transition temperature, and the transition of the low-temperature (LT) form into the high-temperature (HT) form is endothermic.

Polymorphs are different cryst. modifications of the same chem. substance.  When different conformers of the same mol. occur in different crystal forms, the phenomenon is termed conformational polymorphism.  Occasionally, more than one conformer is present in the same crystal structure.  The influence of mol. conformation changes on the formation and stability of polymorphs is the focus of this Account.  X-ray crystal structures of conformational polymorphs were analyzed to understand the interplay of intramol. (conformer) and intermol. (lattice) energy in the crystn. and stability of polymorphs.  Polymorphic structures stabilized by strong O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O/N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds, weak C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interactions, and close packing were considered.  4,4-Diphenyl-2,5-cyclohexadienone (1) and bis(p-tolyl) ketone p-tosylhydrazone (3) are prototypes of C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen-bonded structures.  Distance-angle scatter plots of O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds extd. from the Cambridge Structural Database indicate that polymorphs with a larger no. of symmetry-independent mols. (high Z') generally have better interactions when compared with the polymorphs with lower Z' values, with the implication that these symmetry-independent mols. have different conformations.  Since mol. conformer (Econf) and crystal lattice (Ulatt) energy differences are of the same magnitude in org. crystals (typically <5 kcal mol-1), situations wherein these two factors compensate or cancel one another are illustrative.  Calcn. of conformer and lattice energies using Gaussian 03 and Cerius in 23 recently published polymorph sets shows that a strained conformer (higher Econf) is stabilized by stronger interactions or better crystal packing (lower Ulatt) in 2/3 of the cases, whereas there is no energy balance in the remaining structures.  Org. mols. with flexible torsions and low-energy conformers have a greater likelihood of exhibiting polymorphism because (1) different conformations lead to new hydrogen -bonding and close-packing modes and (2) the tradeoff reduces the total energy difference between alternative crystal structures.  As a test case, polymorph promiscuity in fuchsones (6) is related to the conformational diversity at the exo-methylene Ph rings and the small energy difference computed for di-Me fuchsone polymorphs.  These ideas find application in the design of putative pharmaceutical polymorphs and crystal structure prediction.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXjsFGjtb0%253D&md5=37f933ffe56acffaef04e8abe8ef4690", "5.

Structure of ...\".  Papers of this type were justified then by the considerable effort involved in solving a single crystal structure and in searching the literature for related compds. as a basis for comparison of structural and chem. characteristics.  The evolution of x-ray diffraction methods for structure soln. by both single crystal and powder methods, along with rapid and increasingly comprehensive access to the chem. literature in general and to the structural literature in particular, had changed that situation.  X-ray crystal structure detn. has become a routine anal. tool so that structure detn. is now an integral (and often required) component of synthetic chem.  The resulting proliferation of crystal structures has led to a new awareness of the existence of multiple crystal forms and their importance in a wide variety of applications.  Among those crystal forms polymorphism was first recognized in 1823 and co-crystals have been studies for nearly a century.  However, the development of new technol., the attempts to design and control crystal structure combined with some spectacular encounters with new crystal forms have resulted in a recent spate of chem. crystallog. papers with considerably more enticing titles.  The proliferation of crystal forms has spawned debate about the definition of solvates and co-crystals.  Many solvates will have the structural features of co-crystals and vice-versa.  High-throughput crystn. technol. was developed to provide a tool for rapidly and economically surveying crystal space.  Such information is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry quite early in the drug development process for the appropriate choice of crystal form for formulation, for the protection of intellectual property, and for the anticipation and prevention of the appearance of undesired crystal forms in later stages of the drug life cycle.  Chemists have long employed additives to influence the outcome of a crystn.  They also worked on a system that has become the latter-day quintessential model for a polymorphic system, 5-methyl-2-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-3-thiophenecarbonitrile, commonly known as ROY for the red, orange, and yellow colors of its various polymorphs.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.  We may expect that highly stable MOFs having a large surface area and pore vol., together with many open metal sites and embedded catalysts for hydrogen spillover, would provide some pos. results for H storage at ambient temp.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhs1GlsbjM&md5=dd1f08beefd27cce77d88e466551c1af", "20.

From Raman and IR data, assignment of the obsd. modes to resp. vibrations of atoms is proposed.  The thermal studies show that for the Ni compds. deuteration decreases the phase transition temp. Tc by 5.6 K, whereas it has a negligible effect on Tc in the Mn analogs.  This behavior excludes the possibility of proton (deuteron) movement along the N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O (N-D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) bonds as the microscopic origin of the 1st-order phase transition obsd. in these crystals <190 K.  According to single-crystal x-ray diffraction, the dimethylammonium (DMA) cations are dynamically disordered at room temp., because the H bonds between the NH2 (ND2) groups and the metal-formate framework are disordered.  The highly dynamic nature of H bonds in the high-temp. phases manifests in the Raman and IR spectra through very large bandwidth of modes involving vibrations of the NH2 (ND2) groups.  The abrupt decrease in the bandwidth and shifts of modes near Tc signifies the ordering of H bonds and DMA+ cations as well as significant distortion of the metal-formate framework across the phase transition.  However, some amt. of motion is retained by the DMA+ cation in the ferroelec. phase and a complete freezing-in of this motion occurs <100 K.  The dielec. studies reveal pronounced dielec. dispersion that can be attributed to slow dynamics of large DMA+ cations.  The low-temp. studies also show that magnetic properties of the studied compds. can be explained assuming that they are ordered ferrimagnetically with nearly compensated magnetic moments of Ni and Mn.  IR data reveal weak anomalies <40 K that arise due to spin-phonon coupling.

The shape of the adsorption curves is driven by the alkyl chain length of the n-alkanes.  While traditional type-I isotherms are obsd. for short alkanes (n = 1, 2), adsorbates with longer chains induce clear substeps in the isotherm curves whose positions depend on the chain length.  Such substeps are due to a breathing phenomenon, as proven by ex situ x-ray diffraction anal.  They strongly depend on the amt. of adsorbate in the pores and on the nature of the metal (Al, Cr), which, for a given alkane, leads to a strong change in the substep positions despite the similar characteristics of the two metals.
