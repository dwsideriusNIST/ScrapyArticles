Therefore, the aim of this paper has been to study the influence of different CO", " concentrations on the phenanthrene adsorption in a postcombustion cleanup process when carbonaceous materials are used to remove low concentrations of phenanthrene from a hot exhaust gas stream. Adsorption isotherms were obtained using CO", " and phenanthrene concentrations in the ranges of 0\u221230% and 0.025\u22123.2 ppmv, respectively. The process temperature was fixed to 150 \u00b0C in all runs. All the obtained isotherms were properly fitted to the Freundlich adsorption model and their parameters determined by regression analyses. A negative influence of CO", " in phenanthrene adsorption capacity was observed, probably due to a competitive effect between CO", " and phenanthrene for the adsorption sites within the carbonaceous material. However, it was found that high CO", " concentrations did not affect the phenanthrene adsorption more negatively than low CO", " concentrations. It was thus concluded that the most suitable carbonaceous materials for phenanthrene abatement in flue gases were those having a wide pore distribution with a high average micropore diameter. The development of mesoporosity in adsorbents promotes phenanthrene adsorption because it favors both the access of phenanthrene molecules into the micropores and the phenanthrene multilayer adsorption. Finally, the Yoon and Nelson mathematical model was applied to simulate the breakthrough curves. This model was able to predict the adsorption breakthrough in all the runs. Nevertheless, problems arose when trying to fit breakthrough curves at relative concentrations higher than 70% in those adsorbents with narrow micropore distributions.

The influence of adsorbent surface chemistry was determined from the correlation coefficients between the Phe adsorption capacities and the oxygen surface groups desorbed in TPD. Statistical significance between Phe adsorption capacity and oxygen surface groups was not found probably due to the physical character of the Phe adsorption process at the operating conditions.

Several theoretical complex models have been proposed in the literature", "32", " to simulate breakthrough curves. However, a very simple model, the Yoon and Nelson model,", "33", " has been chosen in this paper due to its simplicity and capacity to fit satisfactorily the obtained breakthrough curves. In this model, no detailed data concerning the characteristics of adsorbate, the type of adsorbent, and the physical properties of adsorption bed ", " are needed. To develop this model, Yoon and Nelson considered that when a gas stream flows through a fixed bed of activated carbon, some of the gas molecules are adsorbed on activated sites while others pass through the activated carbon bed. In addition, they postulated", "34-36", " that the rate of decrease in the probability of adsorption for each adsorbate molecule is proportional to the probability of adsorbate adsorption and the probability of adsorbate breakthrough on the adsorbent.

The theoretical curves calculated according to the Yoon and Nelson mathematical model are also shown. It can be pointed out that the Yoon and Nelson model is appropriate to predict the breakthrough time in both cases independently of the inlet gas stream composition and the textural parameters. It can also be observed that only in those adsorbents with a wide micropore distribution and a high average size diameter, the Yoon and Nelson model could predict the shape of the breakthrough curves. This fact is reflected in Figure 5, where the breakthrough curves on Phe adsorption for CA-14 adsorbent are shown. In this adsorbent, where ", "V", "N", "2", " > ", "V", "CO", "2", ", ", "n", " < 2 and high ", "V", "BJH", ", the Phe molecules did not have mass transfer problems to get into the micropores, independently of the percentage of surface coverage. In Figure 6, the breakthrough curves for an adsorbent with a narrow and homogeneous micropore distribution, CA-6, are shown. It is observed that the model did not fit the breakthrough experimental data obtained for Phe relative concentrations higher than 70%. This fact is probably due to the mass transfer and diffusional problems of Phe molecules when the percentage of surface coverage caused by a micropore entrance blocking increases. The Yoon and Nelson model does not seem to be an appropriate tool to predict the behavior of an active carbon at high surface coverage, probably because it does not take into account changes in the Phe diffusion coefficient. Other mathematical models", "37,38", " consider the change of this parameter at high bed conversions and probably will be able to simulate the breakthrough curve in the whole range of surface coverage.

The goal was to compare the magnitude of emissions from this mode of combustion to that from continuous combustion of streams of particles of the same fuels in pulverized form, conducted previously.  In expts. discussed here, waste tire chunks (3-9 mm), tire crumb (180-212 \u03bcm) and bituminous coal (63-75 \u03bcm) were burned in a horizontal muffle furnace, at a gas temp. of \u22481000\u00b0.  The fuel mass loading in the furnace was varied; residence time of post-combustion gases was \u22481 s.  At the furnace exit, CO, CO2, NOx, polynuclear arom. hydrocarbon (PAH), and particulate emissions were measured.  Results showed that PAH emissions from batch combustion of tire chunks were higher than those from tire crumb, which in turn were an order of magnitude higher than those from coal, under similar combustion conditions.  Increasing mass loading for tire crumb and pulverized coal, increased the specific emissions of PAH.  Increasing the segmentation of the tire, at a fixed mass loading, also increased the specific PAH emissions.  Particulate emissions closely followed PAH emission trends.  Batch combustion of tire chunks resulted in higher particulate yields than tire crumb, with pulverized coal a distant third.  Specific CO emissions from batch combustion of TDF were an order of magnitude higher than those from coal combustion.  For both fuels, CO emissions were detected during release and combustion of the volatiles only.  Specific CO2, and, esp. NOx emissions, from batch combustion of tire crumb were lower than those from coal.  The emission comparison of batch combustion of pulverized fuels in fixed beds with continuous combustion of streams of particles was conducted under laminar flow conditions, similar gas temps. and similar post-combustion residence times.  Results showed: PAH and CO emissions of tire crumb were much lower in the latter mode of combustion, even at bulk equivalence ratios as high as 1.4; to the contrary, for coal, the mode of combustion had little effect on PAH and CO emissions.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3cXislKmtLg%253D&md5=54e9a1e8e0f86179cc2440db6c0cd313", " ", " ", "(11)", "\u2002", "Mastral, A.

A thermogravimetric analyzer measured the adsorption of methylisobutylketone (MIBK) onto a coconut based GAC at concns. ranging from 55 to 10,300 ppmv and temps. ranging from 25 to 105\u00b0C.  The equil. adsorption data was first modeled by the two-parameter isotherms of Langmuir, Brunauer-Emmett and Teller, and Freundlich as well as the three-parameter isotherm of Dubinin-Astakhov.  Also, a new three-parameter isotherm, created by adding a concn.-dependent term to the Freundlich equation, was introduced as the modified Freundlich isotherm.  In both three-parameter isotherms, proper choice of the extra parameter allowed for a more accurate fit of the isotherm than did any of the two-parameter isotherms.  Moreover, the authors have constructed a modified Freundlich polytherm and a Dubinin-Astakhov polytherm that properly described adsorption and desorption over the full range of test temps. and concns.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1MXhsVaqtLc%253D&md5=b45998ef9c3637171c7544dab1ec7afe", " ", " ", "(32)", "\u2002", "Suzuki, M.
