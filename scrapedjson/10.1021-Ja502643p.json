Compared with the previously reported ligands, DPEB has two dangling phenyl rings without carboxylate groups that will remain unrestricted even after the formation of MOFs. Their motion can be restricted through molecular interactions with analytes, leading to responsive turn-on fluorescence. In addition, there is an angle (\u223c114\u00b0) between the two phenyl rings baring carboxylate groups.

It is clearly seen from the crystal structure that 1D chains were formed among DPEB molecules through hydrogen-bonding interactions between carboxylic acid groups (Figure S1). The motion of the dangling phenyl rings in DPEB crystals is fully restricted through C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions, leading to a condensed structure that is responsible for the AIE effect (vide infra).

(b) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of DPEB, NUS-1, and NUS-1a.", "Both NUS-1 and NUS-1a are thermally stable up to 500 \u00b0C, which is substantially higher than the decomposition temperature of DPEB (\u223c300 \u00b0C) due to the formation of a coordination network (Figure S7). The endothermic peaks corresponding to solvent loss in NUS-1 (115.7, 174.7, and 222.3 \u00b0C), ligand decomposition in DPEB (323.3 \u00b0C), and frame decomposition in NUS-1a and NUS-1 (531.7 and 547.3 \u00b0C, respectively) can be identified from the DSC curves (Figure ", "2", "b and Table S1). The most striking point in DSC curves locates in the lower temperature region. There is no noticeable peak in the curve of DPEB. In NUS-1, however, exothermic and endothermic peaks are observed at \u221213.7 and 13.7 \u00b0C during cooling and heating scans, respectively, representing the freezing and melting of DEF solvent trapped inside the framework channels. The melting point of DEF detected by DSC (13.7 \u00b0C) is much higher than that of bulk DEF (\u221261 \u00b0C), indicative of a strong confinement effect of DEF in the framework due to adsorbate\u2013adsorbent interactions.", "(24)", " In comparison with DPEB and NUS-1, a distinct endothermic peak at \u2212132.7 \u00b0C was observed in NUS-1a during the heating scan, while the corresponding exothermic peak was not found due to the temperature limitation of our DSC instrument (\u2212150 \u00b0C). One major difference between NUS-1a and DPEB/NUS-1 is the motion ability of dangling phenyl rings under cryogenic conditions. In DPEB crystals, the motion of dangling phenyl rings is completely restricted due to the close molecular packing. In NUS-1, although the dangling phenyl rings are spread apart along the channels with molecular distance larger than DPEB, their motion is still restricted under cryogenic conditions because of the freezing of DEF solvent trapped nearby. The intramolecular motion under cryogenic conditions is only possible in NUS-1a, in which DPEB ligands are immobilized as isolated moieties in the solvent-free and highly porous MOF matrix. The endothermic peak detected at \u2212132.7 \u00b0C in NUS-1a may reflect the phase transition involving the weakening of the aforementioned C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions and a partial rotation/vibration of dangling phenyl rings. This phase transition is similar to the glass transition in organic polymers", "(25)", " and is rarely reported in coordination polymers such as MOFs.", "Like most of the TPE derivatives, DPEB shows a distinctive AIE behavior, proven by the weak emission in a good solvent (THF) with strong emission in a bad solvent (H", "2", "O; Figure S8). For DPEB crystals, where nonradiative decay through intramolecular motion is suppressed due to close molecular packing, bright emission peaked at 487 nm was observed upon excitation at 400 nm (Figure ", "3", "a and Table S2), which exhibited biexponential fluorescence decay (Figure S9 and Table S2). The fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6", "fl", ") of DPEB crystals is as high as 79%, indicating an efficient light harvest/emission process due to the AIE process. In NUS-1a, where the DPEB molecules are linked by Zn", "4", "O SBUs into a staggered 2D sheet structure that is solvent-free and highly porous, the emission maximum remains almost unchanged (486 nm), suggesting a ligand-based emission with little contribution from Zn", "4", "O SBUs. The \u03a6", "fl", " of NUS-1a is only 15%, which is less than one-quarter of that of the ligand (79%), suggesting that the fluorescence of MOFs with TPE-based ligands containing freely rotating/vibrating phenyl rings (such as DPEB reported herein) can be effectively quenched. Based on the AIE mechanism,", "(26)", " the intramolecular motion supported by DSC should be the reason for the quenching. The as-synthesized NUS-1 shows a slightly higher quantum yield (17%) and an emission maximum at 467 nm that is blue-shifted by 19 nm compared with that of the solvent-free NUS-1a, indicating the possibility of increased interligand coupling.", "(27)", "Figure 3.

(c) Fluorescent microscopy images (first row, optical images; second row, fluorescent images; scale bar, 30 \u03bcm).", "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are selected as the analytes for chemical sensing study. VOCs are toxic air pollutants emitted into the atmosphere from anthropogenic and biogenic sources, whose detection is of great importance in chemical assay and environment monitoring.", "(28)", " Previous studies have revealed the potency of MOFs being used as fluorescent molecular sensors in detecting VOCs.", "(29)", " The chemosensing study was performed by soaking NUS-1a crystals in various VOCs followed by photoluminescence tests. Most of the crystals of NUS-1a\u2283guests appeared bright to the eyes upon illumination with UV light (Figure ", "3", "c). The intensity changes and peak shifts are more clearly illustrated in emission spectra, where there are noticeable shifts of the emission maxima \u03bb", "fl", " (Figure ", "3", "a and Table S2). Compared with pristine NUS-1a (\u03bb", "fl", " = 486 nm), NUS-1a soaked in benzene (NUS-1a\u2283benzene, \u03bb", "fl", " = 504 nm) has the largest red shift (18 nm), while the one soaked in mesitylene (NUS-1a\u2283mesitylene, \u03bb", "fl", " = 458 nm) has the largest blue shift (28 nm). In TPE-based AIE systems, peak shift is normally correlated with the conformation locking of peripheral phenyl rings, where a coplanar conformation would promote the \u03c0 electron conjugation leading to a bathochromic shift (red shift), while a perpendicular conformation tends to weaken the \u03c0 electron conjugation, yielding a hypsochromic shift (blue shift).", "(3b, 26)", " It is highly possible that the peak shifts are caused by the conformation change of dangling phenyl rings of NUS-1a exposed to analytes. Besides peak shift, the expected responsive turn-on fluorescence was also observed. Compared with NUS-1a (\u03a6", "fl", " = 15%), the presence of analytes increases quantum yield distinctly (Table S2). For example, a \u03a6", "fl", " of 49% was achieved in NUS-1a\u2283benzene, indicating effective fluorescence turn-on. A plot of \u03a6", "fl", " versus peak shifts against NUS-1a reveals an interesting relationship, in which the larger the peak shifts (whether it is blue or red shift), the higher the quantum yield is (Figure ", "3", "b). The above observation indicates that the interaction between analytes and dangling phenyl rings in NUS-1a may hinder the rotation/vibration of these phenyl rings to block nonradiative decay and trigger peak shifts along with responsive turn-on fluorescence. This emission mechanism, which is quite different from other fluorescent MOFs such as ligand-based luminescence,", "(27b)", " metal-based luminescence,", "(30)", " and charge transfer,", "(14)", " may offer special detection sensitivity and selectivity that can be used for specific purposes.", "In summary, by judicious ligand design and crystal engineering, we have demonstrated the responsive turn-on fluorescence in MOFs through AIE mechanism. Our approach is to construct the MOF using a TPE-based ligand (DPEB) bearing two freely rotating/vibrating phenyl rings, which are spread apart along the wide channels of the formed 2D staggered framework. This special ligand and MOF structures play a crucial role in determining the unprecedented gas sorption behavior, glass-transition-like phase transition under cryogenic conditions, and responsive turn-on fluorescence upon interactions with various VOCs. Our results strongly reveal the potential of molecular design in functional fluorescent MOFs.

Fluorescent bioprobes are powerful tools for anal. sensing and optical imaging, which allow direct visualization of biol. analytes at the mol. level and offer useful insights into complex biol. structures and processes.  The sensing and imaging sensitivity of a bioprobe is detd. by the brightness and contrast of its fluorescence before and after analyte binding.  Emission from a fluorophore is often quenched at high concn. or in aggregate state, which is notoriously known as concn. quenching or aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ).  The ACQ effect limits the label-to-analyte ratio and forces researchers to use very dil. solns. of fluorophores.  It compels many probes to operate in a fluorescence \"turn-off\" mode with a narrow scope of practical applications.  The unique aggregation-induced emission (AIE) process offers a straightforward soln. to the ACQ problem.  Typical AIE fluorogens are characterized by their propeller-shaped rotorlike structures, which undergo low-frequency torsional motions as isolated mols. and emit very weakly in solns.  Their aggregates show strong fluorescence mainly due to the restriction of their intramol. rotations in the aggregate state.  This fascinating attribute of AIE fluorogens provides a new platform for the development of fluorescence light-up mols. and photostable nanoaggregates for specific analyte detection and imaging.  In this Account, we review our recent AIE work to highlight the utility of AIE effect in the development of new fluorescent bioprobes, which allows the use of highly concd. fluorogens for biosensing and imaging.  The simple design and fluorescence turn-on feature of the mol. AIE bioprobes offer direct visualization of specific analytes and biol. processes in aq. media with higher sensitivity and better accuracy than traditional fluorescence turn-off probes.  The AIE dot-based bioprobes with different formulations and surface functionalities show advanced features over quantum dots and small mol. dyes, such as large absorptivity, high luminosity, excellent biocompatibility, free of random blinking, and strong photobleaching resistance.  These features enable cancer cell detection, long term cell tracing, and tumor imaging in a noninvasive and high contrast manner.  Recent research has significantly expanded the scope of biol. applications of AIE fluorogens and offers new strategies to fluorescent bioprobe design.  We anticipate that future development on AIE bioprobes will combine one- or multiphoton fluorescence with other modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging) or functionalities (e.g. therapy) to fully demonstrate their potential as a new generation of theranostic reagent.  In parallel, the advances in mol. biol. will provide more specific bioreceptors, which will enable the development of next generation AIE bioprobes with high selectivity and sensitivity for mol. sensing and imaging.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXptVCisro%253D&md5=f9866873161ab857a0a7bb0e539f20aa", "6.

To this end, much interest has focused on understanding the low-frequency vibrational dynamics of prototypical systems, such as tetraphenylethylene (TPE), in the hope that such studies would provide more general principles toward the design of new sensors and electronic materials.  The authors hereby show that a perdeuterated TPE-based metal-org. framework (MOF) serves as an excellent platform for studying the low-energy vibrational modes of AIE-type chromophores.

DFT calcns. are then used to deconvolute the electronic and steric contributions to this flipping barrier.  Finally, the authors couple the NMR and DFT studies with variable-temp. x-ray diffraction expts. to propose that both the ethylenic C=C bond twist and the torsion of the Ph rings are important for quenching emission in TPE, but that the former may gate the latter.

However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

The review is written from the perspective of a coordination chemist with an emphasis on understanding the origin of the vapochromic/vapoluminescent responses of the individual sensor materials.  In this sense the current review is less geared toward applications than much of what has been published under the broadly defined label \"electronic noses\".  Nevertheless, the present review includes anal. details for the sensors for which such information is available, but many original studies do not report quant. anal. results and focus themselves on understanding the vapochromism/vapoluminescence phenomenon on a mol. level rather aiming to develop actual sensing devices.

The rapidly growing no. of luminescent coordination polymers (CPs) and metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) illustrates high interest as well as accessibility of such materials.  The interplay between inorg. and org. components in these materials offers a large no. of viable luminescence processes.  The enormous variability of available ligand-metal combinations opens the possibility of creating luminescence \"by design\", based on a proper understanding of the processes involved.  Together with the multifunctionality of MOFs (e.g. porosity) further options like sensing become accessible.  This tutorial review covers the main luminescence processes and focuses esp. on metal-based luminescence of coordination polymers and MOFs.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhvVShsb7J&md5=2307553b462db35a6e01dd58eebdbe7e"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-20/ja502643p/production/images/small/ja-2014-02643p_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-20/ja502643p/production/images/small/ja-2014-02643p_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-20/ja502643p/production/images/small/ja-2014-02643p_0003.gif\">"]}
