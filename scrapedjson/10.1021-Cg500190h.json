The XRD patterns of Figure ", "1", " have been ordered according to the peak broadening, from the widest one (bottom) to narrowest one (top). In spite of the remarkable peak broadening, the identification of the MOF-74 phase is more or less evident in the case of the samples prepared with Mg, Mn, or Zn. However, peak broadening becomes so large in the case of the Co and Ni samples that just a couple of shoulders, those found at the lowest 2\u03b8 position and corresponding to the Miller index 110 and 300, are intuited, questioning that MOF-74 is the present phase and even the crystalline nature of the sample. The significant background of the Mn-, Ni-, and Co-based samples is mainly due to the fluorescence produced by these metal elements when the X-ray radiation source is Cu K\u03b1 (see Figure S1\u2013S3 and S5 in ", "Supporting Information", "), although the contribution of some amorphous phase cannot a priori be discarded.", "Figure 1.

In this sense, a variety of strong evidence (see below) is presented in this article certifying that all five samples whose XRD patterns are compiled in Figure ", "1", " are crystalline and possess a MOF-74 structure. Taking this into account, it is appropriate to estimate the crystal size of the samples through X-ray diffraction peak broadenings. Although it has been made clear the convenience of using other methods different from that based on the Scherrer equation, particularly in microporous materials,", "(37, 38)", " the exclusive detection of only two peaks in some of the diffractograms of Figure ", "1", " forces us to use such equation. In general, it is accepted that the Scherrer equation is more precise for very small crystals, that is, for relatively large broadenings. However, in the case of Co and Ni samples the broadening is so remarkable that it may compromise its own resolution, as the diffraction band is somehow confused with the background. In order to gain precision, the Scherrer equation was applied to XRD patterns of these two samples acquired for much longer times for each point and maintaining the number of points. Figure S4 from ", "Supporting Information", " contains some of the so-acquired XRD patterns compared with that of the same samples shown in Figure ", "1", ", and ", "Table S1", " shows the detailed data of the crystal size estimations by applying the Scherrer equation. The instrumental broadening was taken from the same peaks of an equally registered XRD pattern of a Zn-MOF-74 material prepared under conventional conditions", "(29)", " and therefore formed by relative large crystals. The resulting averaged crystal size from those estimations were 16.6, 13.6, 9.4, 5.1, and 2.8 nm for the M-MOF-74 samples with M being Zn, Mn, Mg, Co, and Ni, respectively.", "3.2", "FT-IR Spectroscopy", "Probably the most extended use of the PXRD technique is as a fingerprint to identify/refute a/some already-known and solved structure(s). Unfortunately, Figure ", "1", " has made clear that phase identification is not possible in the case of Co and Ni samples, and it is even uncertain for the rest of PXRD patterns due to their considerable peak broadening. However, some other techniques apart from PXRD can also work based on a homologue fingerprint strategy. This is the case of infrared spectroscopy, which is not as sensitive as PXRD to the framework topology, but it is quite sensitive to the conformational and/or local environment of organic molecules in the so-called fingerprint region (ca. 500\u20131700 cm", "\u20131", "). Accordingly, deprotonation of the carboxylate groups and their consequent bond to the divalent metals must be evidenced by this spectroscopy. Figure ", "2", " shows the IR fingerprint region of the spectra registered for the five nanocrystalline samples, for the conventional Zn-MOF-74, and for the organic linker. As expected, IR spectra of the linker and the conventional Zn-MOF-74 are markedly different. Likewise, there is a very good agreement between band position and relative intensity between IR spectrum of the nanocrystalline Zn-MOF-74 and that of the conventional Zn-MOF-74. Hence, the match of both FTIR spectra with the spectrum of the linker is quite poor. The most evident difference between the spectra of nanosized and conventional Zn samples is the lower resolution of the bands in the former, which is attributed to the \u201cnano\u201d nature of their crystals. In addition, the band broadening increases from top to bottom, Figure ", "2", ", as a consequence of the decrease of the crystal size of the samples. Obviously, the influence of the nanocrystalline character on spectroscopy does not reach the magnitude of that on the X-ray diffraction broadening, since the latter is a technique of much longer range. However, the simple fact of provoking so perceptible broadening in IR bands gives an idea of the extraordinarily small crystal size.", "(39)", " The IR spectrum of the Mn-MOF-74 sample contains some singularities (extra bands, different relative intensity, etc.) in comparison with the other spectra of the nanocrystalline samples. Nevertheless, even this spectrum mainly follows the main IR pattern of the series and, in any case, it is decidedly different to the IR spectrum of the linker. Therefore, IR studies confirm that all these MOF samples prepared at room temperature are crystalline and suggest that they are indeed formed by crystals of nanoscaled size and that they most likely have a MOF-74 topology, including those more doubtful cases because of its negligible/limited capacity of diffracting X-rays.", "Figure 2.

The difference of \u223c11 \u00b0C between the detected linker decomposition temperatures of nano- and micrometer-crystalline Zn-based MOF-74 samples should be attributed to the well-known influence of crystal size on the dynamic thermogravimetric technique, so that the weight loss of any chemical species is generally found at lower temperatures when the sample is formed by smaller crystals. Therefore, that small difference provided by TGA measurements supports the same phase nature of both Zn-based MOF-74 samples with just some differences in crystal size. However, the order of the linker decomposition is the opposite when micrometer- and nanosized Co-based MOF-74 samples are compared (maximum of decomposition temperature of 301 and 331 \u00b0C, respectively). This fact, together with the SEM characterization of the \u201cnano\u201d Co-MOF-74 sample (Figures ", "6", " and ", "S21\u201322, Supporting Information", "), led us to consider that this sample is formed by large particles of fused nanosized crystals; that is, those particles are formed by Co-MOF-74 nanodomains rather by agglomerates or aggregates of \u201creal\u201d discrete nanocrystals.

Finally, the hysteresis loop of the isotherm of the Ni-MOF-74 basically resembles that of a type H4. H4 loop associated with an isotherms of type I is simply indicative of microporosity. In fact, the almost negligible hysteresis loop of the isotherm of the micrometer-crystalline Zn-MOF-74, whose unique pores must be micropores, is also of type H4.

We should not reject the possibility that the crystals are even smaller, as for instance discrete domains of a size smaller than a unit cell could potentially exist but do not significantly contribute to the XRD detected peaks, so the estimated size would be that only average the size of the crystals able to diffract at some non-null extent.", "Unlike the conventional M-MOF-74 materials, the formation of these nanosized MOFs takes place through a precipitation mechanism. Since the fundamentals of precipitation process are well-known, we have tried to correlate the estimated crystal size of M-MOF-74 materials with different physic-chemical properties conditioning the formation of a precipitate. One of the most influential parameters is the solubility of the chemical species taking part in the final precipitate.

Figure ", "9", " shows an almost linear correlation between so-represented solubility and crystal width when Mn, Mg, Co and Ni acetates (but not Zn) are considered. The reason behind the mismatch of Zn in that correlation could be the different hydration degrees of its source (two water molecules per Zn) in comparison with the rest M acetates (four water molecules per M), considering the strong capacity of water to dissolve any of these acetates. The good correlation between solubility and crystal size among the comparable metal acetates opens the possibility of accurately controlling the crystal size of M-MOF-74 materials (and indirectly their agglomeration or aggregation features) by just changing the solubility of the metal sources, either modifying the counterion nature or the solvent mixture nature/proportion.", "Figure 9.

In general terms, all three plotted magnitudes have almost systematically decreased in the order of M: Zn > Mn > Mg > Co > Ni. The unique nonsystematic slight variation comes from the low-angle peak, whose origin can be influenced by the crystal morphology, crystal size homogeneity, certain spatial ordering of either nanoparticles or mesopores or even a mixture of them. In any case, this magnitude also follows the general trend defined by the other two plotted magnitudes, whose origin is more well-defined and easily interpretable. A second significant feature from Figure ", "10", " is that the practically linear evolution of crystal size estimated by the Scherrer equation along the M series contrasts with the abrupt fall and higher range found in PSD maxima evolution, coinciding with the vertical dashed line. The higher value of PSD maxima than the width found in the two samples with largest nanocrystals (Zn and Mn) can be explained based on the fact that as-applied Scherrer equation provides the width (the smallest dimension) of the rod-like nanocrystals. Consequently, it is not surprising that the mesopores formed by agglomeration of that nanocrystals are larger than the width of those crystals. This effect is visually made clear in Figure ", "6", "-right and Figures S14 and S17 of ", "Supporting Information", ". As the nanocrystals become smaller, they are larger than the pore defined by them. It could be due to a more strong interaction between the nanoparticles, indicating that the presumably more reactive nanocrystals somehow lost their identity becoming simple domains in hardly dissociable particles (Figure ", "6", "-left, Figures S18\u2013S23 of ", "Supporting Information", "). Mg-MOF-74 is an acceptable midpoint between the two scenarios, as some discrete units can be intuited although it is dominated by \u201cfused\u201d crystals (", "Figure S16C, Supporting Information", "). As a consequence, around 10 nm of the crystal/domain size would mark a different behavior of nanocrystalline M-MOF-74 materials (vertical dashed line in Figure ", "10", ").

On the other hand, their use as fillers in polymer-based membranes to give high homogeneity at the \u201cnano\u201d scale would be presumably reached just in the case of the samples formed by separable over-10 nm crystals, whereas samples formed by large particles of nanoscopic domains could be even counterproductive.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results", "Discussion", "Conclusions", "References", "5 Conclusions", "Some important applications of MOFs could be enhanced by decreasing their crystal size down to the nanoscale. This work describes an easy, quick, and economical preparation of a set of nanocrystalline M-MOF-74 materials (M = Zn, Mn, Mg, Co, and Ni). The resultant materials are composed by such small crystals that their identification by diffraction techniques is extremely insufficient.

A combination of characterization techniques corroborates both their \u201cnano\u201d condition and their crystalline nature of MOF-74 materials. Additionally, all samples contain some textural porosity of nature and magnitude well-explained from their crystal size and the tendency of their nanocrystals to be agglomerated or aggregated.

On the contrary, Co and Ni samples are formed by nanodomains \u201cfused\u201d in large particles rather than by discrete nanocrystals. Consequently, isolated domains could not be separated by conventional ultrasonic treatments. Moreover, the control of the crystal size has been suggested to be a function of solubility of the metal source in the synthesis media, and then it could be controlled.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.

The application of templating methods to produce zeolite materials with hierarchical bi- or trimodal pore size distributions is reviewed with emphasis on mesoporous materials.  Hierarchical zeolite materials are categorized into three distinctly different types of materials: hierarchical zeolite crystals, nanosized zeolite crystals, and supported zeolite crystals.  For the pure zeolite materials in the first two categories, the addnl. meso- or macroporosity can be classified as being either intracryst. or intercryst., whereas for supported zeolite materials, the addnl. porosity originates almost exclusively from the support material.  The methods for introducing mesopores into zeolite materials are discussed and categorized.  In general, mesopores can be templated in zeolite materials by use of solid templating, supramol. templating, or indirect templating.  In this categorization of templating methods, the nature of the interface between the zeolite crystal and the mesopore exactly when the mesopore starts to form is emphasized.  In solid templating, the zeolite crystal is in intimate contact with a solid material that is being removed to produce the mesoporosity.  Similarly, in supramol. templating, the zeolite crystal is in direct contact with a supramol. assembly of organized surfactants, which is removed to generate the mesopores.  On the other hand, in the indirect templating method, the interface is between the zeolite crystal and solvent mols., or possibly a gas phase.  It is shown that the available templating approaches are quite versatile, and accordingly, it is possible to produce a very wide range of hierarchical zeolite materials.  The resulting zeolite materials, featuring noncrystallog. mesopores in addn. to the crystallog. micropores, exhibit significantly enhanced diffusional properties in comparison with purely microporous zeolite materials.

Another class of materials are metal-org. coordination polymers, which are based on metal ions coordinated by polydentate org. ligands and explored for potential use in catalysis, gas storage, nonlinear optics and mol. recognition and sepns.  In a subset of these materials, the use of organometallic complexes as ligands (so-called metalloligands) provides an addnl. level of tailorability, but these materials have so far not yet been fashioned into nano- or microparticles.  Here we show that simple addn. of an initiation solvent to a precursor soln. of metal ions and metalloligands results in the spontaneous and fully reversible formation of a new class of metal-metalloligand particles.  We observe initial formation of particles with diams. of a few hundred nanometers, which then coalesce and anneal into uniform and smooth microparticles.  The ease with which these particles can be fabricated, and the ability to tailor their chem. and phys. properties through the choice of metal and org. ligand used, should facilitate investigations of their scope for practical applications.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXht1Gqs7%252FK&md5=9408db85742373d9bb085a86ec527cc3", "9.

These structures can be conveniently synthesized in high yields from the appropriate metal salts and bifunctional ligand precursors.  Unlike conventional metal-org. framework materials (MOFs), these ICPs exhibit a higher level of structural tailorability, including size- and morphol.-dependent properties, and therefore, the promise of a wider scope of utility.  A variety of methods now exist for making numerous compns., with modest control over particle size and shape.  These structures can exhibit microporosity, tunable fluorescence, magnetic susceptibility, and unusual catalytic activity and selectivity.  Perhaps most importantly, many of these ICP structures can be depolymd.

The applications and potentials of thin film coatings of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) supported on various substrates are discussed in this crit. review.  Because the demand for fabricating such porous coatings is rather obvious, in the past years several synthesis schemes were developed for the prepn. of thin porous MOF films.  Although this is an emerging field seeing a rapid development a no. of different applications on MOF films were either already demonstrated or are proposed.  This review focuses on the fabrication of continuous, thin porous films, either supported on solid substrates or as free-standing membranes.  The availability of such two-dimensional types of porous coatings opened the door for a no. of new perspectives for functionalizing surfaces.  Also for the porous materials themselves, the availability of a solid support to which the MOF-films are rigidly (in a mech. sense) anchored provides access to applications not available for the typical MOF powders with particle sizes of a few \u03bcm.  The authors will also address some of the potential and applications of thin films in different fields like luminescence, QCM-based sensors, optoelectronics, gas sepn. and catalysis.  A sep. chapter was devoted to the delamination of MOF thin films and discusses the potential to use them as free-standing membranes or as nanocontainers.  The review also demonstrates the possibility of using MOF thin films as model systems for detailed studies on MOF-related phenomena, e.g. adsorption and diffusion of small mols. into MOFs as well as the formation mechanism of MOFs (101 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXptFSrsw%253D%253D&md5=f0cfc5747b35e6a9477e04afd1d3381f", "12.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

Here, confined space synthesis was adopted to prep. nanosized ZSM-5, zeolite Beta, zeolite X, and zeolite A with tailored crystal size distributions using mesoporous C blacks as inert matrixes.  All zeolites were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction, TEM, and N2 adsorption/desorption prior to and after removal of the C matrix.  ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 50, 100, and \u221e (silicalite-1) were synthesized with controlled av. crystal sizes in the range 20-75 nm.  Nanosized zeolite Beta (7-30 nm), zeolite X (22-60 nm), and zeolite A (25-37 nm) were prepd. similarly.
