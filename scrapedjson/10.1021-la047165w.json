Introduction", " ", "Realistic molecular models of porous carbons are needed to interpret experimental data used to characterize the pore structure of carbons, as well as to predict a wide range of properties (adsorption, heats of adsorption, diffusion rates, etc.) of confined phases within carbons. A variety of models have been proposed [for a review see ref 1", "]. The simplest and most widely used is the slit pore model. However, this model is oversimplified, since it fails to account for pore connectivity or the highly disordered pore structure of many industrial carbons. Recently, we have proposed a new reconstruction method", "2", " based on a constrained reverse Monte Carlo procedure, for building realistic models of such carbons from experimental X-ray or neutron diffraction data. The method was shown to give good agreement with experimental structure data (small- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy) for highly disordered microporous carbons prepared from saccharose. ", " ", "In the work presented here, we address the question of whether such structural models are able to predict the energetics of a fluid adsorbed in the real material. To achieve this, we compare experiment and simulation results for heats of adsorption of argon at 77 K in two carbons produced by pyrolisis of saccharose at two different treatment temperatures. The two materials are termed CS400 (heated at 400 \u00b0C) and CS1000 (heated at 1000 \u00b0C). Structural models of these materials have been developed and tested against experimental TEM images.", "2", " The simulated images reproduce, at least qualitatively, the main features observed in the experimental images. Therefore, the obvious next step is to test the models by comparing adsorption predictions to experiment. ", " ", "The first step toward such a comparison is to design a suitable experimental system (adsorbate, conditions, and experiment). Since our models are intended to describe the ", "microporosity", " of disordered porous carbons, it is desirable to use a small molecule that would be able to probe a higher fraction of the micropore volume. In this respect, nitrogen or argon are suitable candidates, and both have been widely used for the characterization of microporous materials using adsorption-based characterization methods.", "3,4", " In our case, however, it is preferable to use argon as an adsorbate to test the carbon models for the following reasons: ", " ", "(i) Argon atoms are spherical and nonpolar, and they can be logically modeled as Lennard-Jones spheres. On the other hand, nitrogen molecules are diatomic and have a quadrupole; although they can be simplistically modeled as Lennard-Jones spheres, it is necessary to include the quadrupole and the anisotropy in shape to obtain quantitative agreement with experimental structure and thermodynamic data, even for bulk systems.", "5", " Thus, argon\u2212argon interactions can be more accurately described with simple potentials than nitrogen\u2212nitrogen interactions. ", " ", "(ii) Although the carbons that we have modeled have only a small amount of heteroatoms (less than 8% of oxygen), these atoms are present as polar chemical groups (e.g., phenolic and carboxylic groups, ether bridges, etc.) that strongly interact with the nitrogen quadrupole. The potential energy resulting from these Coulombic forces may be quite strong compared to carbon atom\u2212adsorbate interactions, especially at low relative pressures (or fractional filling). Consequently, it would be necessary to include the heteroatoms in the adsorbent model in order to make quantitative predictions of the behavior of nitrogen confined in porous carbons. On the other hand, since argon is nonpolar, the interaction of argon with chemical groups is weak, and any induction interactions are small compared to carbon atom\u2212adsorbate dispersive interactions. This has been verified experimentally by comparing gas adsorption microcalorimetry results for argon and nitrogen in the same activated carbon samples.", "6", " Thus, omitting the heteroatoms in the adsorbent models should not have a strong effect in the prediction of adsorption properties of argon. ", " ", "(iii) The carbon\u2212adsorbate interaction potential parameters are usually derived from experiment by fitting the parameters to Henry's constants (gas\u2212solid virial coefficients) of the adsorbate on a nonporous graphitic surface. However, it has been pointed out that the interaction of nitrogen and other quadrupolar molecules (e.g., carbon dioxide) with carbon segments is highly anisotropic.", "7,8", " The interaction of nitrogen with a carbon segment is largely determined by the position and orientation of the nitrogen molecule relative to the carbon segment. This casts some doubt on the validity of the use of experimentally determined potentials in molecular simulations of nitrogen adsorption in carbons that contain finite graphene segments. Although further investigation is required, it is believed that the main source of anisotropy is the interaction of the nitrogen quadrupole with the \u03c0 electrons of the carbon segment. This problem is thus much less important in the case of argon, which is nonpolar and spherical. ", " ", "The enhancement in potential energy due to the confinement of a fluid in micropores can be measured experimentally by means of gas adsorption microcalorimetry. In these experiments, the isosteric heat of adsorption is measured as a function of the fractional pore filling. An important feature of gas adsorption microcalorimetry is its high sensitivity in the range of low relative pressures, which is exactly the pressure range at which micropore filling takes place.", "3", " On the other hand, experimental isotherm measurements often lack accuracy at low relative pressures. Therefore, since we need to accurately probe the microporosity of these materials to compare to our model predictions, it is convenient to use gas adsorption microcalorimetry. ", " ", "In this work, we first assess the ability of the structural models of carbons to describe the texture of the real materials and to reproduce the energetics of confined argon. We then report grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for three nitrogen models. The intention is to determine the importance of accurately describing the adsorbate\u2212adsorbent intermolecular potential in predicting adsorption behavior.

It was found that simulated TEM images were in qualitative agreement with experimental images; the simulated images capture the most important features observed experimentally and also the change of these features with heat treatment temperature. ", " ", "In this work, we have tested these models by predicting the isosteric heats of adsorption of argon at 77 K and comparing our predictions to experimental gas adsorption microcalorimetry data. The simulated isosteric heats of adsorption in our models of CS400 and CS1000 are in excellent quantitative agreement with the experiments (Figure 6). This implies that the resulting structural models reproduce the potential energy field \u201cseen\u201d by argon in the real materials and, thus, seem to successfully describe the texture of CS400 and CS1000. The isosteric heats of adsorption decrease as a function of coverage. The shape of the experimental curves, which is strongly related to the energetic heterogeneity of the material, is almost exactly reproduced by our models. The small discrepancies at higher fractional filling might be due to the presence of larger pores or external surfaces that are not accounted for in our model. We found that the decrease in the isosteric heat of adsorption is dominated by the adsorbent\u2212adsorbate contribution, as observed in other microporous adsorbents such as zeolites.", "17", " ", " ", "We also presented adsorption isotherms and heats of adsorption at 77 K for three models of nitrogen in CS400 and CS1000. Isosteric heats of adsorption obtained with the 2LJQ_H model are in very good agreement with experiment in the range 0.25 < \u0393/", "\u0393", "0", " < 0.85. We attribute discrepancies at low pressures to the presence of polar ", " groups or attractive points that strongly interact with the nitrogen quadrupole. This is consistent with the fact that this discrepancy is not observed in the case of argon, which is spherical and nonpolar. We also note that, if a realistic description of the solid structure is available, it is important to have a relatively accurate description of the adsorbate in order to obtain good agreement with experiment. Adsorbate\u2212adsorbent potential parameters derived from experimental data are important to obtain the correct behavior at low densities, while a good geometrical description of the adsorbate is necessary at higher densities. ", " ", "We calculated the carbon\u2212argon and argon\u2212argon pair correlation functions. These results, aided by simulation snapshots, can help determine the mechanism of the adsorption process. At very low chemical potentials, the first argon atoms are preferentially adsorbed at the points of lowest carbon\u2212argon potential energy (i.e., the most attractive points), which are characterized by a high local density of carbon atoms, as evidenced by the carbon\u2212argon pair correlation functions (see Figures 11 and 12). These low-energy points are not grouped, but instead they are dispersed throughout the porous network. Carbon atoms are more closely packed in CS1000,", "2", " producing points of higher local carbon density, and thus lower energy points. It is this difference in the structure of the two carbons, and not a difference in pore size distributions, what causes the higher heats of adsorption and higher fractional fillings at lower pressures observed in CS1000. As we have previously pointed out,", "2,25", " interpreting the adsorption behavior observed in CS400 and CS1000 using the slit pore model, would lead to conclude that the observed differences are due to dissimilarities between the pore size distributions of CS400 and CS1000, which is not necessarily the case (see Figure 1). ", " ", "At slightly higher chemical potentials, argon atoms are adsorbed at higher energy points, which are also uniformly distributed throughout the porous network. The average number of carbon atoms in the immediacy of an argon atom decreases, causing the observed decrease in the isosteric heats of adsorption. The larger energy difference between lower carbon\u2212argon energy points in CS1000 causes the decrease in this material to be steeper than that in CS400. A peak in the argon\u2212argon pair correlation function at approximately 2.5 atomic diameters appears due to correlations of argon atoms adsorbed in neighbor sites. ", " ", "Further increasing the chemical potential causes a gradual progression toward micropore filling. When the pores are completely filled, a peak in the argon\u2212argon pair correlation function appears at 2 atomic diameters, which corresponds to the distance at which the second peak of the bulk liquid pair correlation is observed. No defined peaks, however, are observed at higher distances. This reflects the effect of the small pore dimensions on the structure of the confined fluid, which cannot be considered as being bulk liquid. ", " ", "Our results show that the atomic-level structure of disordered porous carbons is essential in explaining the adsorbent\u2212adsorbate potential energy distribution in these materials, which ultimately determines the adsorption mechanism, and thus macroscopic observables (e.g., adsorption isotherm and isosteric heat of adsorption). In improving adsorption-based characterization methods for porous carbons, we suggest the use of isosteric heats of adsorption instead of (or to complement) adsorption isotherms. The shape of the isosteric heat of adsorption as a function of fractional filling is much more sensitive than that of the adsorption isotherm to the heterogeneity caused by the local structure of the adsorbent. Also, it seems that future developments in adsorption-based characterization methods for porous carbons should focus on obtaining adsorbent\u2212adsorbate potential energy distributions, rather than pore size distributions. If the concept of pore-size distribution is preferred, however, future improvements should include heterogeneity in the density of the pore walls. Finally, many realistic models have been developed and are currently being developed. These models take into account the finite length of carbonaceous segments. It is thus necessary to develop new carbon-adsorbate potentials that take into account the effect of the location of the carbon atoms involved. ", " ", " ", " ", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "1.

As in the original reverse Monte Carlo method, the procedure is to stochastically change the at. positions of a system of carbon atoms to minimize the differences between the simulated and the exptl. pair correlation functions. However, applying the original reverse Monte Carlo method without further constraints yields nonunique structures for carbons, due to the presence of strong three-body forces.  In this respect, the uniqueness theorem of statistical mechanics provides a helpful guide to the design of reverse Monte Carlo methods that give reliable structures.  In our method, we constrain the bond angle distribution and the av. carbon coordination no. to describe the three-body correlations.  Using this procedure, we have constructed structural models of two highly disordered porous carbons prepd. by pyrolysis of saccharose at two different temps.  The resulting pair correlation functions are in excellent agreement with those obtained by diffraction expts.

Two potential models were used to model the adsorbate zeolite interactions: one originating from the work of Kiselev which was widely used in previous work, and one developed which, includes high order 2-body dispersion, induced and 3-body interactions, denoted PN1.  Simulation data were compared with exptl. isotherms and isosteric heat curves obtained from microcalorimetry and also with neutron scattering data.  Neither of the potential models used was able to predict the transition obsd. in exptl. isotherms, although the heat curve transitions are reproduced.

From an anal. of neutron data and the thermodn. data, the authors conclude that the step obsd. in the Ar and Kr isotherms must be attributed to an adsorbent transition which possibly induces a rearrangement of the adsorbed phase.

Adsorption and desorption isotherms, heats of adsorption, and three-dimensional singlet distribution functions (SDFs) were generated.  Inspection of the SDFs reveals significant levels of solidlike adsorbate at satn. even in the most complex of the microporous solids considered.  This strongly suggests that solidlike adsorbate will also occur for simple subcrit. vapors adsorbed on real noncryst. solids such as microporous carbons at temps. above the bulk f.p., supporting indirect exptl. observations.  The presence of significant levels of solidlike adsorbate has implications for characterization of microporous solids where adsorbate d. is used (e.g., detn. of pore vol. from loading).  Detailed consideration of the SDF at different loadings for a model microporous solid indicates solidlike adsorbate forms at distributed points throughout the pore space at pressures dependent on the nature of the local porosity.  The nature of the local porosity also dictates the freezing mechanism.  A local freezing/melting/refreezing process is also obsd.  Introduction of mesoporosity into the model causes hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption isotherms.  Adsorption in the hysteresis loop occurs by a series of local condensation events.  It appears as if the presence of adjacent microporosity and/or adsorbate within it affects the pressure at which these events occur.  Reversal of the condensation during desorption occurs throughout the mesoporosity at a single pressure; this pressure is unaffected by the presence of adjacent microporosity or the adsorbate within it.  It is also shown that the empirical concept of \"pore size\" is not consistent for describing adsorption in the complex solids considered here.  A new concept is, therefore, proposed that seeks to account for the factors that affect local adsorption energy: local geometry, microtexture, surface atom d., and surface chem.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2cXjs12msbo%253D&md5=ca0d249a714c44c88dfc21e1601380c7", " ", " ", "(22)", "\u2002", "Douguet, D.; Pellenq, R.

Furthermore, the authors suggest (in light of recent 40Ar diffraction expts. of N. Tosi-Pellenq and J. P.
