It is also a critical thermodynamic property for the design of adsorption processes because it provides a base to estimate the heat released (or consumed) during the adsorption (or desorption) process. Values of the heat of adsorption can be determined either from the variation of adsorption with temperature, or by direct calorimetric measurements; however, the amount of work involved in finding the heat of adsorption at many different loadings and different temperatures by experiment is usually prohibitive (Beebe et al., 1947a,b; Dunne et al., 1996). Some empirical adsorption isotherm equations can be used to determine the isosteric heat of adsorption (", "q", "st", "), but experimental adsorption data are required to determine the parameters in these models; thus, this method is not predictive. Furthermore, different isotherm equations usually lead to different ", "q", "st", " results. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using molecular simulation tools to determine the ", "q", "st", " for various adsorbate\u2212adsorbent systems, especially Monte Carlo techniques (Vernov and Steele, 1991; Razmus and Hall, 1991; Karavias and Myers, 1991; Matranga et al., Bottani et al., 1994; Myers et al., 1997); however, far less work has been done using density functional theory (Jiang et al., 1992; Balbuena and Gubbins, 1993). ", " ", "In this work, density functional theory (DFT), a statistical mechanics model, was used to predict the ", "q", "st", " of propane and butane adsorbed on carbon materials. DFT methods are based on the idea that the grand free energy of an inhomogeneous fluid can be expressed as a functional of \u03c1(", "r", "), the density profile in the pore. The free energy functional is modeled as a sum of two contributions:\u2009 a hard sphere nonlocal core and a mean field attractive tail; and \u03c1(", "r", ") can be obtained by minimization of this functional. Once \u03c1(", "r", ") is known, all of the relevant thermodynamic functions can be calculated. The most elaborated form of this theory, the nonlocal density functional theory (NDFT), has been successfully used to describe fluids confined in narrow pores (Evans and Tarazona, 1984; Peterson et al., 1986; Balbuena and Gubbins, 1993).

", " ", "There have been some discussions about the difference between the absolute properties derived from simulation studies and the excess properties obtained from experiment (Sircar, 1985; Myers et al., 1997). Myers et al. (1997) suggest that the difference between absolute and excess adsorption may be ignored when the pore volume of the adsorbent is negligible compared with the adsorption second virial coefficient (", "B", "1s", ").

", " ", "The ", "q", "st", " values and the adsorption isotherms obtained from the TPLM (experiment) are in fair agreement with those from NDFT. For propane, the adsorption isotherms obtained from the two models agree very well in the low pressure range, but begin to deviate when ", "P", " exceeds 30 kPa; in contrast, butane exhibits deviation in the low pressure range and fairly good agreement at higher pressures.

These differences may have been caused by the inability of the TPLM to represent the full heterogeneity of the systems or to correlate the experimental data precisely in the entire pressure range (Figure 5). Oversimplification of the structure of the adsorbent and the mean field approximation for the attractive potential in NDFT may have also contributed to this discrepancy between the models. ", " ", "The drop of ", "q", "st", " with loading for both propane and butane is typical of heterogeneous adsorbents (Rudzinski and Everett, 1992); and it is reassuring to see that both NDFT and TPLM capture this characteristic. This BAX-activated carbon has a wide range of pore sizes (Figure 8):\u2009 12% of its pore volume has ", "H", " <10 \u00c5, 38.7% of its pore volume is in the micropore range, and 74.5% of its pore volume is within ", "H", " <50 \u00c5. The calculated pore filling pressures for small pores are lower than for large pores, and the adsorption in large pores at low pressures is close to zero. In other words, adsorption starts in small pores at low loadings, then gradually progresses to larger pores with increasing pressure. Keffer et al. (1996) also showed that at low loadings, the adsorbates simply occupy the most energetically favorable positions, and that the total energy is most favorable in the smallest pores. It was shown earlier that ", "q", "st", " decreases with ", "H", "* (Figures 1 and 2); so, based on this pore filling mechanism, ", "q", "st", " drops with loading. At higher loadings, both small and large pores play a role in adsorption, and multilayer adsorption takes place in the larger pores, so the adsorption process becomes more complex with adsorbate\u2212adsorbate interactions becoming appreciable. When the surface heterogeneity is large, the continued fall in the adsorbate\u2212adsorbent interaction masks the adsorbate\u2212adsorbate interaction, causing ", "q", "st", " to drop, which is clearly shown by the NDFT predictions for butane. However for propane, ", "q", "st", " begins to level off with increased loading. This indicates that either adsorbate\u2212adsorbate interactions are becoming more important, or that the BAX-activated carbon is less heterogeneous toward propane than butane in the loading range investigated. ", " ", "Comparing Figures 6a and 7a, it is seen that ", "q", "st", " of butane is \u223c10 kJ/mol higher than that of propane at the same loading. This result is explained by referring to Table 1. The \u03c3", "ff", " values for the two substances are almost the same, but the butane\u2212butane interaction energy is much higher; therefore, \u03b5", "ff", " and \u03b5", "sf", " are higher than those of propane.

The approach is based on the nonlocal d. functional theory (NLDFT) model for nitrogen and argon adsorption in MCM-41, proposed recently.  Samples with pore sizes varying from ca. 25 to 37 \u00c5 were prepd. by hydrothermal synthesis.  Two synthesis procedures employing different sources of V were used to prep. V/MCM-41 catalysts.  The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD).  N2 and Ar adsorption isotherms at 77 K were measured starting from the relative pressure P/P0 = 1 \u00d7 10-5.  Anal. of adsorption isotherms was carried out in two stages.  The first stage implies comparison of a given isotherm with a ref. isotherm measured on a well-characterized sample of MCM-41 with uniform pores.  From such a comparison, micropore vol., sp. surface area of mesopores, and the point of the beginning of the capillary condensation are detd.  In the second stage, pore size distributions are calcd. from the NLDFT.  Pore size distributions obtained from N2 and Ar isotherms at 77 K were in perfect agreement.  These results were compared with the traditional Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, and with the XRD data.  It is shown that the BJH method underestimates an av. pore size in MCM-41 materials by ca. 10 \u00c5.  Adsorption studies of V/MCM-41 catalysts revealed that the synthesis procedure with the direct addn. of V2O5 yields samples with a more uniform pore structure than the procedure with the use of VOSO4\u00b73H2O soln.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK2sXislyrt7k%253D&md5=8968c960187231c5ca9ac0e5fa4a4bd7", " ", " ", "Razmus, D.
