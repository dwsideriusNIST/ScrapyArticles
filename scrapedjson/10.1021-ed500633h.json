A theor. and exptl. error anal. is done to det. accuracy and robustness of the measurements.  For this study, activated carbon was selected as the adsorbent and hydrogen as the adsorbate gas.  A sensitivity anal. was done by taking into account the effects of temp., pressure, vol. and wt. of the sample.  The anal. shows that the vols. of the sample and ref. cells as detd. by helium-free space measurements have significant effect on the accuracy of the adsorption uptake measurement.  For instance, a 0.1% error in the measurement of either vol. led to approx. a 3% error in hydrogen uptake measurement at 298 K and 100 bar.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XlvFentrY%253D&md5=1187938229474a95cc85987d5d2c8a5b", "24.
