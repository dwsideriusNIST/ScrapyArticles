The authors explore the possibility of using a new metal-org. framework material, CuBTC, in adsorptive sepn. processes, particularly in a simulated moving bed (SMB) context using isobutane as a potential desorbent.  A gravimetric method was used to measure the adsorption equil. isotherms of propylene, propane and isobutane onto a com. CuBTC powder at 323-423 K and pressures up to 100 kPa.  These were complemented by a detailed exptl. characterization of the structure of CuBTC using XRD and SEM techniques.  Comparison of exptl. isotherms with grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations in CuBTC showed that propane adsorption occurs preferentially in small octahedral pockets, while isobutane is excluded from these pockets due to its bulky structure.  Propylene was seen to interact strongly with unsatd. metal sites, due to specific \u03c0 - Cu bonds.  These interactions significantly enhance the affinity of this MOF for unsatd. hydrocarbons.  Also, in a range of temps. and pressures, the affinity of CuBTC for isobutane is intermediate to that of propane and propylene.

Both expts. and simulations show strong inflection characteristics in the adsorption isotherms.  The primary cause of the inflection is due to the strong preference for adsorption within, and in the regions close to the mouths of tetrahedral pockets.  The isotherm inflection has a significant influence on the dependence of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity, D, on the fractional occupancy, Di.  Both IRM expts. and simulations show that the Di-\u03b8i behavior appears to be influenced by the loading dependence of the inverse thermodn. factor 1/\u0393i = dln\u03b8i/dlnpi.  For nC4 and iC4, the Di increase sharply by about one order of magnitude as the occupancy \u03b8i increases from 0 to about 0.2.  This increase is caused by the fact that the diffusion characteristics undergo a transition from being dominated by hops across narrow 4.6 \u00c5 windows at low loadings to hops across large 9 \u00c5 windows for loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell.  For loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell the Di-\u03b8i dependence of nC4 and iC4 is dictated by 1/\u0393i, characteristic of more open channel structures such as FAU zeolite.

To represent the large diversity of MOF structures, the expts. were carried out with (i) two MOFs with coordinatively unsatd. metal sites (CUS), i.e., Cu-btc (HKUST-1) and CPO-27-Ni, (ii) a MOF with an anionic framework and extraframework cations, i.e.  RHO-ZMOF, and (iii) two rather apolar zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) materials with different pore sizes, i.e.  ZIF-8 and ZIF-76.

The results can be briefly summarized as follows: ZIFs (not carrying any polar functional groups) behave like apolar adsorbents and exhibit very interesting and unexpected mol. sieving properties.  CUS-MOFs behave like polar adsorbents but show the specificity of preferring alkenes over aroms.  This feature is rationalized thanks to DFT + D calcns.

The unusual shape of the adsorption isotherms with the existence of steps was successfully modelled by creating a (narrow pore, large pore) phase mixt. domain, the compn. of which varies with pressure.  A further step consisted of combining the computational approach with several exptl. tools including microcalorimetry, gravimetry and in situ x-ray diffraction, to fully characterize the adsorption behavior of the isostructural MIL-47(V) rigid MOF, i.e. the preferential arrangement of each type of alkane inside the pores and the resulting interaction energy.  Finally, relations are established between the adsorption enthalpies and both alkyl chain length and polarizability of the alkanes that can be further used to predict the energetics of the adsorption process for longer alkane chains.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXntF2htrk%253D&md5=7d5d5a672ca9257241fa5fa19e35e204", "23.

The shape of the adsorption curves is driven by the alkyl chain length of the n-alkanes.  While traditional type-I isotherms are obsd. for short alkanes (n = 1, 2), adsorbates with longer chains induce clear substeps in the isotherm curves whose positions depend on the chain length.  Such substeps are due to a breathing phenomenon, as proven by ex situ x-ray diffraction anal.  They strongly depend on the amt. of adsorbate in the pores and on the nature of the metal (Al, Cr), which, for a given alkane, leads to a strong change in the substep positions despite the similar characteristics of the two metals.
