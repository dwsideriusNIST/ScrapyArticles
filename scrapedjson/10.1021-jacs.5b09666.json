Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.  Furthermore, gas sepns. in MOFs, including the mol. sieving effect, kinetic sepn., the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 sepn., and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXkvVamurY%253D&md5=cbb650af8ce92526fc8ffd870218bbd0", "3.

Porous metal-org.frameworks (MOF) have been extensively studied to assess their use in near-future technologies to safely store energetic environmentally relevant gases.  The tunable nature of MOF pores may help mitigate environmental problems caused by volatile org. compd. (VOC) release (C. Yang, et al., 2011).  An example of MOF design amenability is the isoreticular series (Zn4OL3, where L = arene-dicarboxylate), where pore size and functionality can be modulated in a highly rational, systematic manner (M. Eddaoudi, et al., 2002 and H. Furukawa, et al., 2010).  This work designed and isolated an isoreticular series of porous MOF whose pore size and polarity were modulated by coupling stiff bi-pyrazolate or mixed pyrazolate/carboxylate linkers to Ni2+ hydroxo clusters acting as 12-connected nodes.  This combination yielded a series of [Ni8(OH)4(H2O)2(L)6]n MOF, i.e., [Ni8(L)6], which exhibit highly porous 3-dimensional networks analogous to those recently reported by the authors (N. Masciocchi, et al., 2010, and E. Quartapelle Procopio, et al., 2011).  Synthesis and structural and textural properties of the [Ni8(L)6] isoreticular series are presented, together with their possible use to adsorb VOC pollutants even in highly competitive, moisture-rich atm.

As demonstrated by single-crystal x-ray crystallog., C2H2/CO2 hexamers are confined inside the nanocages of MAF-2 in different configurations.  The subtle difference between C2H2 and CO2 is magnified by consequent framework dynamics, which produce sigmoid isotherms that are optimized for practical adsorptive applications.  Large C2H2 uptake (70 cm3 g-1) and high C2H2/CO2 uptake ratio (3.7) at 298 K, 1 atm as well as facile gas desorption are revealed.  Since the C2H2 uptake at 298 K, 1 atm is far from satn.
