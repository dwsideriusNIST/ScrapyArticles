Specifically, by transforming it with encapsulated catalysis-responsible polyoxometalate from octahedron characterized entirely by {111} facets to cube with only {100} facets, much enhanced catalytic activities were observed, especially for sterically demanding substrates that are otherwise hard to diffuse into the pores.

The catalysis results are collected in ", "Table ", "1", ". The esterification between acetic acid and methanol, both being smaller than the pore size of NENU-3a, was carried out (entry 1, ", "Table ", "1", "). Catalyzed by either form of NENU-3a, excellent conversion of the substrates to methyl acetate was observed with ", "c", "-NENU-3a exhibiting a slightly higher catalytic activity (>99% conversion) than ", "o", "-NENU-3a (90% conversion) under otherwise identical conditions. With the increasing size of the alcohols (Entries 1\u20137, ", "Table ", "1", "), the reactivity of ", "c", "-NENU-3a decreased slightly as indicated by a small decrease in conversion down to 92% when ", "n", "-octanol, the longest-chain alcohol among all tested, was used (Entry 7). In stark contrast, ", "o", "-NENU-3a suffered from a significant loss in catalytic activity as reflected by the reduced conversion to only 35% (", "Figure S4", " and entry 7, ", "Table ", "1", "). Most revealing are the significantly different results using ", "n", "-hexanoic acid and ", "n", "-hexanol as substrates: As high a conversion as 83% was achieved with the use of ", "c", "-NENU-3a versus only 31% in the case of ", "o", "-NENU-3a (entry 8). Results of these comparative studies collectively point to the superior catalytic performance of the cubic form of NENU-3a and its insensitivity to the steric bulk of the substrates. These results also suggest that the different facets of the two distinct crystal forms should be responsible for the observed differences in catalysis, and most significantly, catalytic conversion may now be achieved on surface of crystalline MOF materials if the degree of exposure of the catalytic sites can be manipulated with the appearance of specific crystal facets. The significance of such surface-promoted transformations cannot be overstated as the catalytic applications of MOFs have been hampered by the limited access to catalytic sites confined within the porous structure, in particular for substrates that are larger than the size of the pores.", "Stimulated by the prospect of achieving catalytic esterification using bulky substrates that are otherwise hard to convert due to their inability to access the catalytic MOF pores, the preparation of long-chain (C", "12", "\u2013C", "22", ") fatty acid monoalkyl esters, the main components of biodiesels, a form of intensively sought-after renewable energy, was attempted. Catalyzed by ", "c", "-NENU-3a, high conversion (\u226590%) of fatty acids into corresponding esters was achieved in all cases (entries 9\u201314, ", "Table ", "1", "). Consistent with the conclusions drawn based on the results from entries 1\u20138, the anticipated compromised performance by octahedral NENU-3a was indeed observed (conversion 16\u201322%). These results further suggest that the catalysis should occur on the crystal surface as diffusion of the bulky fatty acids into the HPW-housing pores is unlikely.", "To further understand the reacting process of different substrates, we carried out time-resolved studies of NENU-3a-catalyzed synthesis of ethyl acetate (entry 2, ", "Table ", "1", ") and methyl hexadecanoate (entry 11, ", "Table ", "1", "), the latter being a dominating component in biodiesels. The formation of ethyl acetate is expected to occur both inside the pores and on the crystal surface, while for the fatty acid, conversion to methyl hexadecanoate can only be achieved on the external surface due to the bulk of the acid and the product. For comparison, the performances of cubic and octahedral HKUST-1 (", "c", "- and ", "o", "-HKUST-1, respectively) in the same two reactions were also investigated. As shown in ", "Figure ", "2", "a, similar conversion ratios were observed in the first 2 h for the synthesis of ethyl acetate, indicating that the reaction occurred primarily within the pores of both ", "o", "- and ", "c", "-NENU-3a. Distinctly different profiles of conversion were obtained thereafter: A conversion of 90% catalyzed by ", "c", "-NENU-3a was achieved after 5 h of reaction, while in the case of ", "o", "-NENU-3a the conversion was only 65% and a much longer reaction period to 24 h was necessary in order to reach the same level of conversion at 90%. We suspect the results are a reflection of the synergy between substrates diffusion limit and surface reaction. Specifically, in the initial 2 h of reaction, the process was dominated by the prediffused substrates in both cubic and octahedral catalysts. As the reaction progresses, the product must diffuse out of the pores in order to free up the space for the uptake of additional reactant molecules. It is entirely reasonable to envision that the movement of the outgoing product and the reactant molecules entering in opposite directions is limited by the micropores of NENU-3a and further hindered by the zigzag pathways (", "Figure S5c", "), thus resulting in a reduced reaction rate. But reactions occurring on the crystal surface should not be affected. This argument is further supported by the even more profound difference in conversion in the synthesis of methyl hexadecanoate because the reaction can only occur on the external surface of NENU-3a; any internal HPW sites are catalytically noncontributing. A corollary is that the catalysis-responsible HPW sites are much more exposed on the {100} facets of the better-performing ", "c", "-NENU-3a than on the {111} facets of ", "o", "-NENU-3a. As shown in ", "Figure ", "2", "b, the catalytic activity of ", "c", "-NENU-3a is much higher than the other three; the low activity of both cubic and octahedral HKUST-1 is not unexpected due to the lack of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites and the ready inactivation of the unsaturated Cu sites by aqua ligands.", "Figure 2.

However, the SEM images of recovered samples showed some degree of morphological change that might be attributed to the vigorous stirring during the reaction (", "Figure S8", ").

A scrutiny of pores A and B revealed subtle yet distinct difference between the two very similar pores. Pore A features six open square windows in the [100] direction and eight closed triangle walls along the [111] direction (", "Figures ", "3", "a and ", "S5a", "). In contrast, all surfaces of pore B are open, characterized by six square windows and eight triangle ones (", "Figures ", "3", "b and ", "S5b", "). As a result, when viewed along the [111] direction, the HPW units are covered by the BTC ligands and deeply buried in the crystal bulk (", "Figures ", "3", "c and ", "S10a", ").

Clearly, the signals in this region should be attributed to Br\u00f6nsted acidity of the HPW units in NENU-3a. However, the profiles of the NH", "3", "-TPD curves are distinctly different between the cubic and octahedral crystals of NENU-3a.

Such differences can only be attributed to the different locations of the acid sites as the two forms of the crystal are compositionally and structurally identical. The NH", "3", " molecules attracted on the surface of the catalyst can be desorbed much more easily than those within the pores of the framework due to longer diffusion path and kinetic barrier.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

A typical example is titanium dioxide (TiO2), which has promising energy and environmental applications.  Most available anatase TiO2 crystals are dominated by the thermodynamically stable {101} facets (more than 94 per cent, according to the Wulff construction), rather than the much more reactive {001} facets.  Here we demonstrate that for fluorine-terminated surfaces this relative stability is reversed: {001} is energetically preferable to {101}.  We explored this effect systematically for a range of non-metallic adsorbate atoms by first-principle quantum chem. calcns.  On the basis of theor. predictions, we have synthesized uniform anatase TiO2 single crystals with a high percentage (47 per cent) of {001} facets using hydrofluoric acid as a morphol. controlling agent.

Colloidal metal-org. frameworks (CMOFs), nanoporous colloidal-sized crystals that are uniform in both size and polyhedral shape, are crystals composed of metal ions and org. bridging ligands, which can be used as building blocks for self-assembly in org. and aq. liqs.  They stand in contrast to conventional metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), which scientists normally study as bulk cryst. powders.  However, powder MOFs generally have random crystal size and shape and therefore do not possess either a definite mutual arrangement with adjacent particles or uniformity.  CMOFs do have this quality, which can be important in vital uptake and release kinetics.  In this Account, the authors present the diverse methods of synthesis, pore chem. control, surface modification, and assembly techniques of CMOFs.  The authors survey recent achievements and future applications in this emerging field.  There is potential for a paradigm shift, away from using just bulk cryst. powders, towards using particles whose size and shape are regulated.  The concept of colloidal MOFs takes into account that nanoporous MOFs, conventionally prepd. as bulk cryst. powders with random crystal size, shape, and orientation, may also form colloidal-sized objects with uniform size and morphol.  Also, the traditional MOF functions that depend on porosity present addnl. control over those MOF functions that depend on pore interactions.  They also can enable controlled spatial arrangements between neighboring particles.  To begin, progress regarding synthesis of MOF nano- and microcrystals whose crystal size and shape are well regulated are discussed.  Next, the authors review the methods to modify the surfaces with dye mols. and polymers.  Dyes are useful when seeking to observe nonluminescent CMOFs in situ by optical microscopy, while polymers are useful to tune their interparticle interactions.  Third, criteria to assess the stability of CMOFs for various applications are discussed.  In another section of this Account, the authors give examples of supracrystal assembly in liq., on substrates, at interfaces, and under external elec. fields.

The assembly of metal ions with org. ligands through the formation of coordination bonds gives cryst. framework materials, known as metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), which recently emerged as a new class of porous materials.  Besides the structural designability of MOFs at the mol. length scale, the researchers in this field very recently made important advances in creating more complex architectures at the mesoscopic/macroscopic scale, in which MOF nanocrystals were used as building units to construct higher-order superstructures.  The structuring of MOFs in such a hierarchical order certainly opens a new opportunity to improve the material performance via design of the phys. form rather than altering the chem. component.  This review highlights these superstructures and their applications by categorizing them into four dimensionalities, zero-dimensional (0D), 1-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) superstructures.  Because the key issue for structuring of MOFs is to spatially control the nucleation process in desired locations, this review conceptually categorizes the available synthetic methodologies from the viewpoint of the reaction system.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXht1Slu7bJ&md5=fc123b03795b8bc780fbaa300a8043ac", "17.

Control of crystal size is achieved in a novel approach by employing an excess of the bridging bidentate ligand and various simple auxiliary monodentate ligands with different chem. functionalities (carboxylate, N-heterocycle, alkylamine).  The function of the monodentate ligands can be understood as a modulation of complex formation and deprotonation equil. during crystal nucleation and growth.  Using time-resolved static light scattering, the functioning of modulating ligands is monitored for the 1st time by in situ expts., which offered significant insight into the crystal growth processes.  Formation of nanocrystals is characterized by continuous, comparatively slow nucleation and fast crystal growth occurring on a time scale of seconds.  Although nucleation and growth are not sepd. from each other, a significant narrowing of the particle size distribution during early stages results in rather monodisperse nanocrystals, before broadening of the particle size distribution occurs, as obsd. by complementary ex situ electron microscopy studies.  Microcrystal growth is dominated by a particle-monomer addn. mechanism, but indications for the operation of a coalescence process during early stages of growth were also obtained.  During later stages of microcrystal growth crystals change their shape from cubes to rhombic dodecahedra.
