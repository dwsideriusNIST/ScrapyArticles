As the temperature of the heat treatment was increased up to 250 \u00b0C, no significant change in the morphology of ZIF-8-C was observed in the SEM images (Figure ", "1", "a1,a2 and ", "Figures S1a1\u2013a4 and S2a1\u2013a4", " in the ", "Supporting Information", ").

The heat treatment at 400 \u00b0C resulted in the surface of ZIF-8 being covered almost completely by tiny, spherical particles (Figures ", "1", "a4, ", "S1a6, and S2a6", "). The morphological transition trend was more pronounced for cubic ZIF-8-W (Figure ", "1", "c1\u2013c4 and ", "Figures S1c1\u2013c6 and S2c1\u2013c6", ") and can be characterized by three regions: (1) The smooth outer surface and original cubic shape were well preserved up to 250 \u00b0C, (2) tiny particles appeared primarily on the outer surface at 300 \u00b0C, and (3) tiny particles covered the whole outer surface of the cubic ZIF-8-W, though the initial cubic framework was well-preserved.

However, as observed in the XRD patterns for ZIF-8-M (\u223c90 nm) and -W (\u223c420 nm) in Figure ", "2", "b,c, the transition toward ZnO was rather more pronounced for ZIF-8-W, possibly indicating that the smaller ZIF-8-M particles were aggregated significantly and accordingly, the effective particle size of ZIF-8-M was larger than that of ZIF-8-W. In addition, exposure of ZIF-8-M to the higher temperature of 400 \u00b0C under air, which should expedite reactions with oxygen, showed complete conversion of ZIF-8 to ZnO after 6 h, and the resulting ZnO structure was well-preserved up to 2 d (", "Figure S3", ").", "The XRD analysis also revealed that, unlike the other ZIF-8s, ZnO coexisted with ZIF-8-D to some extent in the as-synthesized sample (Figure ", "2", "d, blue arrows).

In general, the weight changes up to \u223c300 \u00b0C were comparable to each other in both air and nitrogen atmospheres, revealing that physisorbed impurities and/or guest molecules were removed from ZIF-8s up to that temperature. This result may indicate the structural integrity of ZIF-8 is independent of the surrounding environment. However, beyond \u223c300 \u00b0C distinct behaviors in the weight change were observed in the air and nitrogen environments. In the air environment, the weight change for all ZIF-8s was dramatically decreased at \u223c400 \u00b0C and reached a plateau until \u223c1000 \u00b0C. This indicates that the reaction of zinc with oxygen predominated at \u223c400 \u00b0C and the concomitant weight reduction was ascribed to the thermal degradation of the ZIF-8 structure due to the combustion of the organic moieties (i.e., mim). Although the high thermal stability of ZIF-8s up to \u223c300\u2013450 \u00b0C under air", "(15, 24, 36)", " is often reported from TGA results and a similar conclusion can be drawn by referring to ", "Figure S4", ", the corresponding XRD patterns in Figure ", "2", " indicate that ZIF-8s were likely thermally stable up to \u223c250 \u00b0C following 2 d exposure.

It seems that the structure of ZIF-8 was well maintained under inert conditions (N", "2", ") up to \u223c600 \u00b0C, mainly due to the strong interaction between Zn atoms and mim ligands; above 600 \u00b0C the thermal decomposition and degradation of ZIF-8s are expected to occur. Considering that the boiling point of 2-methylimidazole is \u223c267\u2013268 \u00b0C, the TGA result under N", "2", " supports the strong interaction between Zn atoms and mim ligands.

Based on this, we further investigated the effect of the exposure time, up to 30 d, on the thermal stability of ZIF-8s at the temperatures of 100, 200, and 250 \u00b0C. The gradual morphological changes, characterized by the above-mentioned three regions at 250, 300, and 400 \u00b0C (Figure ", "1", "), was comparable to those observed after 30 d heat treatments at 100, 200, and 250 \u00b0C for all ZIF-8s (", "Figures S6 and S7", ").

This representative feature might suggest that a longer exposure time results in the initiation of a phase transition toward the ZnO phase, even at 200 \u00b0C. This result emphasizes the importance in ensuring the thermal stability of ZIF-8s before use in real applications; three main factors, (1) temperature, (2) environment, and (3) duration, should be appropriately considered to confirm stability.", "The XRD patterns obtained after 30 d heat treatment (", "Figure S8", ") shows a general trend of the phase transition from ZIF-8 via unknown intermediate phases toward ZnO. Among the four ZIF-8s, only the structure of ZIF-8-C was well preserved after heat treatment at 200 \u00b0C, whereas ZIF-8-M and -W showed a deviation from the original ZIF-8 structure, and ZIF-8-D included an increased amount of ZnO whose formation was seemingly facilitated by the coexistence of ZnO prior to heat treatment. For most of the samples, heat treatment at 250 \u00b0C for 30 d resulted in the complete transition toward ZnO, though for ZIF-8-C, which showed a high resistance to the phase transition at 200 \u00b0C, a complete conversion to ZnO was not observed. This thermal stability test indicates that the exposure of ZIF-8 to temperatures greater than 200 \u00b0C under air results in an undesired phase transition to the ZnO phase. Therefore, careful handling is required of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid crystals (here, ZIF-8) that share the common features (here, thermal phase transitions) with organic materials such as polymers. For the use of ZIF-8s up to 30 d, heat treatment and thermal activation of as-synthesized or dried ZIF-8s at 200 \u00b0C under air can be regarded as the maximum temperature at which ZIF-8 can be heat-treated without structural damage due to the undesired reaction of Zn with oxygen. However, the activation environment (e.g., air or pure oxygen) should be considered along with the activation temperature and duration, as mentioned above. In the literature, a similar conclusion was drawn with respect to the upper limit regarding the thermal stability of ZIF-8 under air. Zhu et al.", "(53)", " and Cravillon et al.", "(50)", " reported the thermal stability of ZIF-8s up to \u223c200 \u00b0C under air based on TGA results, not XRD results. Considering the fact that the sufficient exposure at a fixed temperature is required to confirm the long-term thermal stability of ZIF-8s, a sole conclusion from TGA results, strongly dependent on the heating ramp rate, purge gas flow rate, and so on, is not desirable. Here, we suggest that along with other characterizations (e.g., TGA), the thermal stability of ZIF-8 should be verified primarily by the XRD results with a sufficiently long exposure.", "Despite the proposed appropriate thermal activation at \u223c200 \u00b0C, the prolonged exposure of ZIF-8s to 200 \u00b0C and even at 100 \u00b0C under air for more than 30 d is highly expected to cause their structural damage. Considering the fact that the long-term stability (on the order of a year) even under air should be secured for the robust use of ZIF-8s in desired applications (e.g., membranes, adsorbents, catalyst supports, etc.), dried four type ZIF-8-", "x", " (", "x", " = C, M, W, and D) were exposed to the ambient condition at 100 and 200 \u00b0C for \u223c1 year.

The resulting XRD patterns (", "Figure S11", ") confirmed a structural damage of ZIF-8s to some extent after heat treatments at 100 \u00b0C and the pronounced structural conversion to the ZnO phase after 200 \u00b0C heat treatments, except for ZIF-8-W_200_1y, which showed a higher resistance against the phase transition toward ZnO. This long-term thermal stability test of ZIF-8s supports that oxidative conditions (here, air), if possible, need to be avoided for preserving their structural integrity and thus for realizing the associated properties.", "Figure 3.

Asterisks (*) indicate the XRD peak corresponding to the Pt sample holder.", "Thermal Stability of ZIF-8s under Inert Conditions", "Under air, the conversion of ZIF-8 to ZnO occurs at sufficiently high temperatures. Conversely, under nonoxidative or inert environments, thermal degradation of ZIF-8 is instead expected at higher temperatures. To confirm this hypothesis, we measured in situ XRD patterns for all four types of ZIF-8s while increasing temperatures under both air and argon (Figure ", "3", "). The presence and absence of oxygen during heat treatments lead to the phase conversion of ZIF-8 to ZnO and the thermal-structural degradation of the ZIF-8s, respectively. Similar to the XRD analysis (Figure ", "2", "), all four ZIF-8s were structurally damaged as the temperature was increased. In particular, at \u223c400 \u00b0C, ZIF-8-M and -D were already converted to ZnO, whereas ZIF-8-C and -W showed a mixture of ZIF-8 and ZnO phases and a reduced degree of the ZIF-8 phase, respectively. Referring to Figure ", "2", ", it was suggested above that the effective size of ZIF-8-M was larger than that of ZIF-8-W. However, the in situ XRD analysis revealed a higher resistance of larger ZIF-8-W with respect to reaction with oxygen toward ZnO than ZIF-8-M, indicating that the effective size of ZIF-8-W was larger under these conditions. In addition, ZIF-8-C, which was the most stable based on the 30 d heat treatments (", "Figure S8", "), showed an almost structural conversion toward the ZnO phase compared to ZIF-8-W (Figure ", "3", "a1,c1). This result possibly shows that the sensitivity of thermal-structural changes in ZIF-8s under air may be due to the different degree of aggregation under severe heat treatments and accordingly, reaction with oxygen that plausibly results in localized temperature profiles. Despite the small discrepancies in the rate of the structural damage and the concomitant zinc oxide formation, all of the trends in the XRD patterns support a structural change toward the most stable ZnO phase as the heat treatment temperature is increased under air. This result also emphasizes the need for appropriate and careful handling of ZIF-8s for their robust use in applications, especially under oxidative conditions.", "Under inert conditions, it appears that the original ZIF-8 structure was well-preserved even up to \u223c500 \u00b0C, indicating a strong interaction between Zn atoms and mim ligands, as supported by the TGA results in ", "Figure S4", ". Above 500 \u00b0C, additional peaks were observed for all four samples, as indicated by the red arrows, and the ZIF-8 phase was gradually damaged and eventually collapsed to an unknown phase (Figure ", "3", "a2\u2013d2). Therefore, ZIF-8s can be used at temperatures up to \u223c400\u2013500 \u00b0C under inert conditions, though a longer exposure test should be carried out to verify their structural stability under these conditions.", "ZIF-8s for Use as Membranes and Catalyst Supports", "The high thermal stability of ZIF-8s allowed for their use as catalyst supports.", "(23, 30)", " However, to the best of our knowledge, their stability under the appropriate reaction conditions has not yet been intensively investigated. In this study, ZIF-8-C, -M, and -W, which do not contain impurities of ZnO, were exposed to water gas shift (WGS) reaction conditions at different temperatures (300, 400, and 500 \u00b0C) for 5 h.

During structural conversion, encapsulated Au particles originally inside ZIF-8s are likely inaccessible to reactants in the collapsed ZIF-8 structure and end up being placed on ZnO particles.

This supports that the structural change of ZIF-8 frameworks under oxidative conditions was critical in determining catalytic properties (e.g., those of encapsulated Au nanoparticles) and, accordingly, directs to the desirability in careful handling of ZIF-8s.

On the contrary, the ZIF-8 structure was well preserved under inert conditions up to \u223c400\u2013500 \u00b0C, as expected from the strong interactions between the ZIF-8 constituents. In addition, we correlated the partial structural degradation with the resulting adsorption properties. Although not pronounced in the XRD patterns, thermal activation processes at 250 \u00b0C under air resulted in a partial structural collapse, and the corresponding BET surface areas were significantly reduced (\u223c44\u201354%) compared with those obtained from ZIF-8s activated under vacuum. Through a comparison with the activation conditions for ZIF-8s in the literature, we propose that thermal activation at \u223c200 \u00b0C is reasonable for ZIF-8s, being independent of the environment (air or inert conditions). In contrast, the CO", "2", " adsorption amounts at 30 \u00b0C and 1 bar revealed \u223c13\u201328% reductions for ZIF-8s, thermally activated at 250 \u00b0C under air. Finally, the partially collapsed ZIF-8 structure obtained following activation at \u223c250 \u00b0C under air could result from the dissociation between zinc and imidazolate, as suggested by FT-IR. Through this correlation with XRD (related to structural properties) and N", "2", " physisorption at 77 K and CO", "2", " adsorption capacities (related to adsorption properties), it was noted that the activation conditions (environment, temperature, duration, etc.) should be carefully selected for the intended use of the ZIF-8.", "Currently, we are fabricating ZIF-8 membranes to use the intrinsic molecular sieve properties of ZIF-8s.

Reducing anthropogenic CO2 emission and lowering the concn. of greenhouse gases in the atm. has quickly become one of the most urgent environmental issues of our age.

In view of the extremely wide variety of available microporous structures, there is a need for a systematic screening of potential candidates in order to obtain the best permeation selectivities, Sperm.  The permeation selectivity is a product of the adsorption selectivity, Sads, and the diffusion selectivity, Sdiff, i.e. Sperm = Sads \u00d7 Sdiff.

Because the small size of the windows, it allows in principle for mol. sieving of gases such as H2 and CH4.  However, the unexpected adsorption of large mols. on ZIF-8 suggests the existence of structural flexibility.  ZIF-8 flexibility is explored combining different exptl. techniques with mol. simulation.  The ZIF-8 structure is modified by gas adsorption uptake in the same way as it is at a very high pressure (i.e., 14,700 bar) due to a swing effect in the imidazolate linkers, giving access to the porosity.  Tuning the flexibility, and so the opening of the small windows, has a further impact on the design of advanced mol. sieving membrane materials for gas sepn., adjusting the access of fluids to the porous network.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXmtlWrt70%253D&md5=f9d8904cd7cd4f8d703600d849849f8c", "68.

However, their Zn environments were not characterized directly by 67Zn solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy.  This is because 67Zn (I = 5/2) is unreceptive with many unfavorable NMR characteristics, leading to very low sensitivity.  The authors report, for the 1st time, a 67Zn natural abundance SSNMR spectroscopic study of several representative zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and MOFs at an ultrahigh magnetic field of 21.1 T.  Work demonstrates that 67Zn magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra are highly sensitive to the local Zn environment and can differentiate nonequiv. Zn sites.  The 67Zn NMR parameters can be predicted by theor. calcns.  Through the study of MOF-5 desolvation, with the aid of computational modeling, 67Zn NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable structural information on the MOF systems with structures that are not well described.  Using ZIF-8 as an example, further 67Zn NMR spectroscopy is highly sensitive to the guest mols. present inside the cavities.  Work also shows that a combination of 67Zn NMR data and mol. dynamics simulation can reveal detailed information on the distribution and the dynamics of the guest species.  The present work establishes 67Zn SSNMR spectroscopy as a new tool complementary to x-ray diffraction for solving outstanding structural problems and for detg. the structures of many new MOFs yet to come.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xht12jsLbL&md5=3409b5d223d7ab4b1b2397ddafafcb90", "69.
