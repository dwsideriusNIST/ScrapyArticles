Then we continue with hydrogen bonding of nucleobases, by analyzing energetics of std. base pairs, mismatched base pairs, thio-base pairs, and others.  After this, the nature of arom. stacking interactions is explained.  Also, nonclassical interactions in nucleic acids such as interstrand bifurcated hydrogen bonds, interstrand close amino group contacts, C-H\u2261O interbase contacts, sugar-base stacking, intrinsically nonplanar base pairs, out-of-plane hydrogen bonds, and amino-acceptor interactions are commented on.

The basic building units of these materials consist of metal-nucleobase fragments which link together through coordination bonding or by means of supramol. assembling among the nucleobases anchored to metal centers.  In the case of extended systems based on coordination bonds, the connectivity among the metal centers can be achieved through bridging nucleobases and/or by auxiliary org. linkers such as carboxylate and dicarboxylate anions.

On the other hand, the geometrical rigidity imposed by several metal-nucleobase fragments and the base pairing interactions through complementary hydrogen bonding, lead to structural restraints that preclude an effective filling of the space, and as a consequence, it favors the growth of tailor-made open-frameworks based either on coordination bonds (MBioFs) or on non-covalent interactions (supraMBioFs).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXlsFaqsbs%253D&md5=e68d911ec1fda8351be6dae01fab7fdf", "17.

The clusters react with cobaltous ions in aq. soln. to ppt. the new solid phases [Co2(H2O)4][Re6S8(CN)6]\u00b710H2O (1), Cs2[Co(H2O)2][Re6S8(CN)6]\u00b72H2O (2), and [Co(H2O)3]4[Co2(H2O)4][Re6Se8(CN)6]3\u00b744H2O (3).  The structures of 1\u00b72H2O and 3 were detd. by single-crystal x-ray anal.  The former consists of an expanded Prussian blue type framework with [Re6S8]2+ and [Co2(\u03bc-OH2)2]4+ cluster cores occupying alternate metal ion sites, and features cubelike cages enclosing water-filled cavities \u223c258 \u00c53 in vol.  The latter structure exhibits a network of Co2+ ions and [Co2(\u03bc-OH2)2]4+ cores connected through [Re6Se8(CN)6]4- clusters, defining an array of 1-dimensional channels with min. internal diams. of 4.8 \u00c5.  A Rietveld refinement against x-ray powder diffraction data established compd. 2 as isostructural to an analogous Fe-contg. phase with a two-dimensional framework reminiscent of the Hoffman clathrates.  Thermogravimetric analyses show that all three compds. are fully dehydrated by \u223c100\u00b0, with no further significant loss of mass <500\u00b0.  Upon exposure to di-Et ether vapor, the color of compds. 1 and 3 immediately changes from orange to an intense blue-violet or blue; other polar solvents induce somewhat different colors.  These (reversible) changes are assocd. with the emergence of an envelope of new absorption features at wavelengths between 500 and 650 nm, and the magnitude of the response to a solvent can be estd. by measuring the relative intensity of a band with a max. near 600 nm.  The authors propose that the vapochromic response is due to solvent mols. entering the pores of the solid, where they disrupt the hydrogen-bonded water network, prompting the release of bound water from the [Co2(H2O)4]4+ clusters and conversion of their Co centers from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination.  Significantly, this process does not destroy the three-dimensional connectivity in either structure, but rather creates a much more flexible framework that can expand to accommodate the incoming solvent mols.  Spectroscopic and magnetic data confirm the change in coordination geometry, and the trends in solvent responses (e.g., methanol < ethanol < n-propanol < i-propanol) are consistent with a decreased ability to support the bridging water ligands of the clusters as steric bulk increases.

X-ray crystallog. characterization reveals that adjacent layers are stacked such that channels are created, except in 5.  The channels form a H-bonded interior for guest mols.; in practice, 1a contains EtOH and H2O mols. as guests in the channels with H bonds, whereas 3b (3a) contains THF (acetone) mols.  In 1a, the double-edged axe-shaped motifs in adjacent sheets are not located over the top of each other, while the motifs in 3b stack so perfectly as to overlap each other in an edge-to-edge fashion.  This subtle change in the three-dimensional framework is assocd. with the template effect of the guests.  Compd. 5 has no guest mols. and, therefore, the amide groups in one sheet were used for H-bonding links with adjacent sheets.  Removal of the guest mols. from 1a and 3b (3a) causes a structural conversion accompanied by a color change.  Pink 1a cannot retain its original framework and changes into a blue amorphous compd.  However, the framework of pink 3b (3a) is transformed to a new cryst. framework of violet 4.  The complex 4 reverts to the original pink crystals of 3b (3a) when it is exposed to THF (or acetone) vapor.  Spectroscopic measurements (visible, EPR, and IR) provide a clue to the crystal-to-crystal transformation; on removal of the guests, the amide groups were used to form the \u03b2 sheet-type H bonding between the sheets, and thus the framework withstands significant stress on removal of guest mols.  This mechanism is attributed to the arrangement of the adjacent sheets so suited in regularity that the \u03b2 sheet-type structure forms efficiently.  The apohost 4 does not adsorb cyclopentane, showing a guest selectivity that, in addn. to size, H-bonding capability is required for the guest mols.

It allows three main operation modes: a focused configuration, where both mirrors can focus the beam at the sample position to 52 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.5 \u03bcm FWHM (H \u00d7 V); a defocused configuration that can match the size of the beam to the dimensions of the crystals or to focus the beam at the detector; and an unfocused configuration, where one or both mirrors are removed from the photon beam path.  To achieve a uniform defocused beam, the slope errors of the mirrors were reduced down to 55 nrad RMS by employing a novel method that has been developed at the ALBA high-accuracy metrol. lab.  Thorough commissioning with X-ray beam and user operation has demonstrated an excellent energy and spatial stability of the beamline.  The end-station includes a high-accuracy single-axis diffractometer, a removable mini-kappa stage, an automated sample-mounting robot and a photon-counting detector that allows shutterless operation.  The positioning tables of the diffractometer and the detector are based on a novel and highly stable design.  This equipment, together with the operation flexibility of the beamline, allows a large variety of types of crystals to be tackled, from medium-sized crystals with large unit-cell parameters to microcrystals.

All data were analyzed, processed and refined using std. Bruker software.  The results show that Ag K\u03b1 radiation can be beneficial when heavy elements are involved.  A numerical absorption correction based on the positions and indexes of the crystal faces is shown to be of limited use for the highly focused microsource beams, presumably because the assumption that the crystal is completely bathed in a (top-hat profile) beam of uniform intensity is no longer valid.  Fortunately the empirical corrections implemented in SADABS, although originally intended as a correction for absorption, also correct rather well for the variations in the effective vol. of the crystal irradiated.  In three of the cases studied (two Ag and one Mo) the final SHELXL R1 against all data after application of empirical corrections implemented in SADABS was below 1%.  Since such corrections are designed to optimize the agreement of the intensities of equiv. reflections with different paths through the crystal but the same Bragg 2\u03b8 angles, a further correction is required for the 2\u03b8 dependence of the absorption.  For this, SADABS uses the transmission factor of a spherical crystal with a user-defined value of \u03bcr (where \u03bc is the linear absorption coeff. and r is the effective radius of the crystal); the best results are obtained when r is biased towards the smallest crystal dimension.

The presence of three disulfide bridges in crambin and an FeS(4) unit in rubredoxin enabled automated Patterson interpretation as well as direct methods to be tried.  Although both structures were already well established, the known structures were not used in the phasing attempts, except for identifying successful solutions.  Direct methods were not successful for crambin, although the correct phases were stable to phase refinement and gave figures of merit clearly superior to any obtained in the ca 500 000 random starting phase sets that were refined.  It appears that the presence of an iron atom in rubredoxin reduces the scale of the search problem by many orders of magnitude, but at the cost of producing 'over-consistent' phase sets that overemphasize the iron atom and involve partial loss of enantiomorph information.  However, about 1% of direct-methods trials were successful for rubredoxin, giving mean phase errors of about 56 degrees (for all E > 1.2) that could be reduced to about 20 degrees by standard E-Fourier recycling methods.  Limiting the resolution of the data degraded the quality of the solutions and suggested that the limiting resolution for routine direct-methods solution of rubredoxin is about 1.2 A.  With the 0.9 A data, automated Patterson interpretation convincingly finds the three disulfide bridges in crambin and the FeS(4) unit in rubredoxin, and in both cases E-Fourier recycling starting from these 'heavier' atoms yields almost the complete structure.  Whereas crambin could only be solved in this way at very high resolution, rubredoxin could be solved by Patterson interpretation down to 1.6 A.  These results emphasize the benefits of collecting protein data to the highest possible resolution, and indicate that when a few 'heavier' atoms are present, it may prove possible in favorable cases to solve the phase problem from a single native data set collected to 'atomic resolution'.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD2czpsVOmtA%253D%253D&md5=70f5fd9f089e86d05ee02386125e70b7", "29.

To increase metal-organic framework porosity, the size and complexity of linkers has increased.  Here we present a promising alternative strategy for constructing mesoporous metal-organic frameworks that addresses the size of the vertex rather than the length of the organic linker.  This approach uses large metal-biomolecule clusters, in particular zinc-adeninate building units, as vertices to construct bio-MOF-100, an exclusively mesoporous metal-organic framework.  Bio-MOF-100 exhibits a high surface area (4,300 m(2) g(-1)), one of the lowest crystal densities (0.302 g cm(-3)) and the largest metal-organic framework pore volume reported to date (4.3 cm(3) g(-1)).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BC387hs1aqtQ%253D%253D&md5=f3e1b4211d4dd9b90b59c063efb087bd", "58.
