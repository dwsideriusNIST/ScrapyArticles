MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.

Flexible MOFs combine the cryst. order of the underlying coordination network with cooperative structural transformability.  These materials can respond to phys. and chem. stimuli of various kinds in a tunable fashion by mol. design, which does not exist for other known solid-state materials.  Among the fascinating properties are so-called breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host-guest interactions.  Phase transitions are triggered by guest adsorption/desorption, photochem., thermal, and mech. stimuli.  Other important flexible properties of MOFs, such as linker rotation and sub-net sliding, which are not necessarily accompanied by crystallog. phase transitions, are briefly mentioned as well.  Emphasis is given on reviewing the recent progress in application of in situ characterization techniques and the results of theor. approaches to characterize and understand the breathing mechanisms and phase transitions.  The flexible MOF systems, which are discussed, are categorized by the type of metal-nodes involved and how their coordination chem. with the linker mols. controls the framework dynamics.

The efforts focused on how both geometric and chem. properties, such as void fraction (Vf), volumetric surface area (Sv), and heat of adsorption (Qst), impact methane deliverable capacity, i.e., the amt. of methane adsorbed at some storage pressure minus the amt. adsorbed at the delivery pressure.  With the aid of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, the authors studied methane adsorption and delivery properties in a population of 122,835 hypothetical pcu metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) and 39 idealized C-based porous materials.  From the simulation results, the authors developed an anal. equation that helped one delimit the necessary material properties to reach specific methane deliverable capacity targets.  The max. deliverable capacity between 65 and 5.8 bar among the hypothetical MOFs was 206 cm3(STP)/cm3 at 298 K.  Artificially increasing the methane-MOF interaction strength by increasing the Lennard-Jones \u03b5 parameters of the MOF atoms by 2- and 4-fold only improved the max. deliverable capacity up to 223 and 228 cm3(STP)/cm3, resp.  However, the effect on the amt. stored at 65 bar was more significant, which suggested another strategy; raising the temp. of the system by 100 K can recover \u223c70% of the methane stranded at the delivery pressure.  By increasing the delivery temp. to 398 K, the ARPA-E target was reached by a few hypothetical MOFs with quadrupled \u03b5 values.  This work shows the difficulty in reaching the ARPA-E target but also suggests that a strategy that combines a material with a large volumetric d. of sites that interact strongly with methane and raising the delivery temp. can greatly improve the performance of nanoporous materials for methane storage and delivery.  The optimal heat of adsorption in an isothermal storage and delivery scenario is \u223c10.5-14.5 kJ/mol, whereas in the nonisothermal storage and delivery scenario the optimal heats of adsorption fell within a range of 11.8-19.8 kJ/mol.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXktlentbg%253D&md5=f3aa5d0ec08105ec631fd6dcd5cc8e30", "9.

In recent studies it is reported that covalent functionalization of the org. linker can influence or even integrate framework flexibility (breathing) in MOFs.  However, rational fine-tuning of such responsive properties is very desirable but challenging as well.  Here the authors present a powerful approach for the targeted manipulation of responsiveness and framework flexibility of an important family of pillared-layered MOFs based on the parent structure [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n (bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).  A library of functionalized bdc-type linkers (fu-bdc), which bear addnl. dangling side groups at different positions of the benzene core (alkoxy groups of varying chain length with diverse functionalities and polarity), was generated.  Synthesis of [Zn2(fu-bdc)2(dabco)]n yields the resp. collection of highly responsive MOFs.  The parent MOF is only weakly flexible; however, the substituted frameworks of [Zn2(fu-bdc)2(dabco)]n contract drastically upon guest removal and expand again upon adsorption of DMF, EtOH, or CO2, etc., while N2 is hardly adsorbed and does not open the narrow-pored form.  These breathing dynamics are attributed to the dangling side chains that act as immobilized guests, which interact with mobile guest mols. as well as with themselves and with the framework backbone.  The structural details of the guest-free, contracted form and the gas sorption behavior (phase transition pressure, hysteresis loop) are highly dependent on the nature of the substituent at the linker and can therefore be adjusted using the authors' approach.  Combining the authors' library of functionalized linkers with the concept of mixed-component MOFs (solid solns.) offers very rich addnl. dimensions of tailoring the structural dynamics and responsiveness.  Implementation of two differently functionalized linkers in varying ratios yields multicomponent single-phased [Zn2(fu-bdc')2x(fu-bdc'')2-2x(dabco)]n MOFs (0 < x < 1) of increased inherent complexity, which feature a nonlinear dependence of their gas sorption properties on the applied ratio of components.  Hence, the responsive behavior of such pillared-layered MOFs can be extensively tuned via an intelligent combination of functionalized linkers.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XmvV2gu7g%253D&md5=77c6f577d9bbe291f8f0acc44f27de76", "(k) ", "Mu", ", ", "B.", "; ", "Li", ", ", "F.", "; ", "Huang", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Walton", ", ", "K.

The x-ray structures at different degrees of desolvation indicate the highly flexible nature of the framework.  The framework deformations involve slippage of the layers and movement of the two interpenetrated frameworks with respect to each other.  The coordination geometry of a zinc paddle-wheel unit (one of the popular SBUs) is considerably changed by bond breaking between zinc and oxygen atoms during the drying process.  Two zinc atoms in the dried form 2d reside in a distorted tetrahedral geometry.  Compd. 2d has no void vol. and favors the uptake of O2 over Ar and N2 at 77 K.  The O2 and Ar adsorption isotherms of 2d show gate-opening-type adsorption behaviors corroborating the structure detn.  The CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K exhibits multiple steps originating from the flexibility of the framework.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "(d) ", "Colombo", ", ", "V.", "; ", "Galli", ", ", "S.", "; ", "Choi", ", ", "H.

Using in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction, the carbonation of brucite [Mg(OH)2] in wet scCO2 was examd. at pressure (82 bar) as a function of water concn. and temp. (50 and 75 \u00b0C).

Tests conducted at 75 \u00b0C resulted in the conversion of brucite into magnesite [MgCO3] instead, apparently through an intermediate nesquehonite step.  Raman spectroscopy applied to brucite reacted with 18O-labeled water in scCO2 show it was incorporated into carbonate at a relatively high concn.

Adsorption expts., ideal adsorbed soln. theory (IAST) predictions, breakthrough expts., 1st-principles calcns., and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations reveal that Co-MOF-74 exhibits the highest thermodn. propene/propane selectivity (\u223c46) ever reported for MOFs, due to strong \u03c0-complexation between the open Co2+ sites and the propene mols.  The trend of selectivities for M-MOF-74 materials is explained well by the binding strengths from 1st-principles calcns.  For all M-MOF-74 materials, the selectivity increases with increasing pressure due to the special structural properties of these MOFs: high densities of metal sites as well as optimal pore widths and vols.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xnt12hsA%253D%253D&md5=e539dd5baab9851a42c66a323ac7928c", "(c) ", "Mason", ", ", "J.

Here, we briefly discuss high-pressure adsorption measurements and review efforts to develop metal-org. frameworks with high methane storage capacities.  To illustrate the most important properties for evaluating adsorbents for natural gas storage and for designing a next generation of improved materials, six metal-org. frameworks and an activated carbon, with a range of surface areas, pore structures, and surface chemistries representative of the most promising adsorbents for methane storage, are evaluated in detail.  High-pressure methane adsorption isotherms are used to compare gravimetric and volumetric capacities, isosteric heats of adsorption, and usable storage capacities.  Addnl., the relative importance of increasing volumetric capacity, rather than gravimetric capacity, for extending the driving range of natural gas vehicles is highlighted.  Other important systems-level factors, such as thermal management, mech. properties, and the effects of impurities, are also considered, and potential materials synthesis contributions to improving performance in a complete adsorbed natural gas system are discussed.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhvVGntLvE&md5=05a99cd7be9ef1819aca42d1c36f1f1d", "(d) ", "Deria", ", ", "P.", "; ", "Li", ", ", "S.", "; ", "Zhang", ", ", "H.", "; ", "Snurr", ", ", "R.
