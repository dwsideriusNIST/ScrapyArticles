Various substrates and support materials have been used, including silica, porous alumina, graphite and org. surfaces, i.e. self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold, as well as silica surfaces.  Most of the MOF films were grown by immersion of the selected substrates into specifically pre-treated solvothermal mother liquors of the particular MOF material.  This results in more or less densely packed films of intergrown primary crystallites of sizes ranging up to several \u03bcm, leading to corresponding film thicknesses.  Alternatively, almost atomically flat and very homogeneous films, with thicknesses of up to ca. 100 nm, were grown in a novel stepwise layer-by-layer method.  The individual growth steps are sepd. by removing unreacted components via rinsing the substrate with the solvent.  The layer-by-layer method offers the possibility to study the kinetics of film formation in more detail using surface plasmon resonance.  In some cases, particularly on SAM-modified substrates, a highly oriented growth was obsd., and in the case of the MIL-53/MIL-88B system, a phase selective deposition of MIL-88B, rather than MIL-53(Fe), was reported.

Co2+ ions linked by bpe ligands, the Co\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Co distance through the bpe bridge being 13.65(3) \u00c5.  Each metal ion, in a layer, defines the edges of a rhombus.  Two thiocyanate groups trans-coordinated to the metal atoms are perpendicular to the sheets.  Each sheet has an infinite no. of perpendicular sheets concatenated with it in such a way that a polycatenane structure results.  The structure of 2 also contains parallel sheets composed of cobalt atoms and bpe mols., but concatenation is absent and the thiocyanate groups are replaced by water mols.  In this case, the metal atoms define the edges of a square and the Co\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Co distance through the bpe bridge is 13.78(3) \u00c5.  Uncoordinated perchlorate anions and methanol mols. are linked by hydrogen bonds to the water mols. and they connect alternate parallel layers, occupying the middle of the intermediate layers.  The structure of 3 exhibits an almost planar arrangement of Co2+ ions forming rectangular rings through hydrogen bonds involving both coordinated and free bpe groups and coordinated water and methanol mols.  The Co\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Co distances through the coordinated and uncoordinated bpe bridges are 14.6(1) and 16.8(1) \u00c5, resp.
