Replacing the oxygen in the side chain of Ser-MTV-MOF with sulfur yields Cys-MTV-MOF, which can only form a weak dipole\u2013quadrupole interaction or a nonstandard hydrogen bond with CO", "2", " and thus adsorbs only marginally more than unsubstituted MOF-5. Replacing the \u2212OH of Tyr-MTV-MOF and Ser-MTV-MOF with \u2212H generates, respectively, Phe-MTV-MOF and Ala-MTV-MOF, neither of which can bind with CO", "2", " except via weak van der Waals interactions, similar to unsubstituted MOF-5. The relative abilities of these side chains to interact with CO", "2", " correspond well with recent trends found for interactions between carbon dioxide and substituted benzenes using density functional theory.", "(40, 41)", "At the highest simulated CO", "2", " pressure (3500 kPa), storage capacity can be regarded largely as a function of free volume mildly perturbed by side chain functionality. For example, unsubstituted MOF-5 possesses the largest free volume (191,524 \u00c5", "3", ", see ", "Supporting Information", " for all free volumes) and is outperformed only by Arg-Asp-MTV-MOF. Ala-MTV-MOF and Ser-MTV-MOF are the next most adsorptive materials at 3500 kPa, showing nearly identical capacities, and indeed their free volumes differ by less than 200 \u00c5", "3", ". The compound with the next largest free volume is Cys-MTV-MOF, followed by Thr-MTV-MOF and His-MTV-MOF, but the poorly CO", "2", "-philic thiol renders Cys-MTV-MOF the worst among this triplet, although the capacities are all within 0.01 mmol/g. Finally, Tyr-MTV-MOF and Phe-MTV-MOF possess the largest side chains and thus the smallest free volumes, and their corresponding excess adsorptions at 3500 kPa accordingly are the lowest in this study.", "In order to probe the effect of side chain geometry on excess adsorption capacity, two approaches were followed. In the first approach, the backbone of Tyr-MTV-MOF was frozen, and molecular dynamics (MD) was used to randomly generate different side chain orientations. The full results from this procedure are given as ", "Supporting Information", ", but there is essentially no difference in calculated excess CO", "2", " adsorption based solely on side chain orientation.", "In the second approach, Arg-Asp side chains were added to unsubstituted MOF-5 supercells in a systematic, layer-by-layer fashion. First, Arg-Asp moieties were added to the inner BDC linkers of layer C (see Figure ", "1", "a), to give 12 total amino acid side chain substitutions. Next, structures were similarly generated via substitutions, 24 in total, of separated layers (A and F) and (in separate simulations) neighboring layers (C and D). Similarly, three supercells bearing 36 side chains were constructed, with layers totally separated (A, C, and F), partially separated (A, B, and F), or contiguous (B, C, and D).

Analogous results for different His and Thr substitution patterns are also presented as ", "Supporting Information", ".", "Figure 3. Cooperative carbon capture observed in simulations containing different placement of Arg-Asp side chains.", "Figure ", "3", " offers support for synergistic adsorption of CO", "2", " by the side chains for some of these incompletely substituted AA-MTV-MOFs. If the CO", "2", " adsorption properties were dependent solely on the concentration of functional groups, then there would be no difference between the three purple lines in Figure ", "3", ", as they all bear 18 Arg and 18 Asp side chains. However, if functional groups can cooperate to bind CO", "2", ", provided they are in close proximity, then functionalization on neighboring layers should show improved adsorption, which is indeed what is seen in Figure ", "3", ". Substitution with Arg-Asp on three neighboring layers (36-BCD) is superior to the partially separated substitution pattern (36-ABF), which in turn is superior to the fully separated substitution pattern (36-ACF). Similar results are also seen for substitutions to two layers (24-CD and 24-AF) with both Arg-Asp and His (see ", "Supporting Information", "), albeit to a lesser extent. Adding two layers of Thr (see ", "Supporting Information", ") to unsubstituted MOF-5 shows nearly identical adsorption irrespective of layer separation, indicating that this synergistic adsorption may only be operative for strongly CO", "2", "-philic functional groups such as the guanidinium of Arg, but not for the secondary alcohol of Thr.

While each approach used was consistent with a solid solution model for MTV-MOFs, rather than segregated domains built from the different components, the inherent disorder and experimental limitations precluded a definitive investigation of the effect of varying side chain orientation on gaseous adsorption.

Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.  Furthermore, gas sepns. in MOFs, including the mol. sieving effect, kinetic sepn., the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 sepn., and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXkvVamurY%253D&md5=cbb650af8ce92526fc8ffd870218bbd0", "6.

This approach uses the simple generic force field model (Parm94), and attempts to add a minimal no. of extra Fourier components to the torsional energies, but doing so only when there is a phys. justification.  The results are quite encouraging, not only for the 34-mol. set that was studied by both the highest level ab initio model (GVB/LMP2) and expt., but also for the 55-mol. set for which high-quality exptl. data are available.  Considering the 55 mols. studied by all the force field models for which there are exptl. data, the av. abs. errors (AAEs) are 0.28 (this model), 0.52 (MM3), 0.57 (CHARMm [MSI]), and 0.43 kcal/mol (MMFF).  For the 34-mol. set, the AAEs of this model vs. expt. and ab initio are 0.28 and 0.27 kcal/mol, resp.  This is a lower error than found with MM3 and CHARMm, and is comparable to that found with MMFF (0.31 and 0.22 kcal/mol).  The authors also present 2 examples of how well the torsional parameters are transferred from the training set to the test set.  The abs. errors of mols. in the test set are only slightly larger than in the training set (differences of <0.1 kcal/mol).  Therefore, a simple generic force field with a limited no. of specific torsional parameters can describe intra- and intermol. interactions, although all comparison mols. were selected from 82-compd. training set.  Also this effective 2-body model can be extended for use with a nonadditive force field (NAFF), both with and without lone pairs.  Without changing the torsional parameters, the use of more accurate charges and polarization increases av. abs. error compared with expt., but adjustment of the parameters restores the level of agreement found with the additive model.  After reoptimizing the \u03a8, \u03a6 torsional parameters in peptides using alanine dipeptide (6 conformational pairs) and alanine tetrapeptide (11 conformational pairs), the new model gives better energies than the Cornell et al. force field.  The av. abs. error of this model for high-level ab initio calcn. is 0.82 kcal/mol for alanine dipeptide and tetrapeptide as compared with 1.80 kcal/mol for the Cornell et al. model.  For nucleosides, the new model also gives improved energies compared with the Cornell et al. model.  To optimize force field parameters, the authors developed a program called parmscan, which can iteratively scan the torsional parameters in a systematic manner and finally obtain the vest torsional potentials.  Besides the org. mols. in test set, parmscan was also successful in optimizing the \u03a8, \u03a6 torsional parameters in peptides to significantly improve agreement between mol. mech. and high-level ab initio energies.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3cXlsVylt78%253D&md5=c81631289cf58f63917e2a9fa9547ab6", "37.

The key observation is that the problems encountered in detg. the Coulomb energy by pairwise, spherically truncated r-1 summation are a direct consequence of the fact that the system summed over is practically never neutral.  A simple method is developed that achieves charge neutralization wherever the r-1 pair potential is truncated.  This enables the extn. of the Coulomb energy, forces, and stresses from a spherically truncated, usually charged environment in a manner that is independent of the grouping of the pair terms.  The close connection of our approach with the Ewald method is demonstrated and exploited, providing an efficient method for the simulation of even highly disordered ionic systems by direct, pairwise r-1 summation with spherical truncation at rather short range, i.e., a method which fully exploits the short-ranged nature of the interactions in ionic systems.
