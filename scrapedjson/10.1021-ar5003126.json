With rapid depletion of nonrenewable traditional fossil fuels, which currently account for almost 86% of the worldwide energy output, the search for viable alternative energy resources is becoming more important from a national security and economic development standpoint. Nuclear energy, an emission-free, high-energy-density source produced by means of controlled nuclear fission, is often considered as a clean, affordable alternative to fossil fuel. However, the successful installation of an efficient and economically viable industrial-scale process to properly sequester and mitigate the nuclear-fission-related, highly radioactive waste (e.g., used nuclear fuel (UNF)) is a prerequisite for any further development of nuclear energy in the near future. Reprocessing of UNF is often considered to be a logical way to minimize the volume of high-level radioactive waste, though the generation of volatile radionuclides during reprocessing raises a significant engineering challenge for its successful implementation. The volatile radionuclides include but are not limited to noble gases (predominately isotopes of Xe and Kr) and must be captured during the process to avoid being released into the environment. Currently, energy-intensive cryogenic distillation is the primary means to capture and separate radioactive noble gas isotopes during UNF reprocessing. A similar cryogenic process is implemented during commercial production of noble gases though removal from air. In light of their high commercial values, particularly in lighting and medical industries, and associated high production costs, alternate approaches for Xe/Kr capture and storage are of contemporary research interest. The proposed pathways for Xe/Kr removal and capture can essentially be divided in two categories: selective absorption by dissolution in solvents and physisorption on porous materials. Physisorption-based separation and adsorption on highly functional porous materials are promising alternatives to the energy-intensive cryogenic distillation process, where the adsorbents are characterized by high surface areas and thus high removal capacities and often can be chemically fine-tuned to enhance the adsorbate\u2013adsorbent interactions for optimum selectivity. Several traditional porous adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbon have been tested for noble gas capture but have shown low capacity, selectivity, and lack of modularity. Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are an emerging class of solid-state adsorbents that can be tailor-made for applications ranging from gas adsorption and separation to catalysis and sensing.

On the basis of our own experimental work on Xe/Kr separation using MOF-based adsorbents, it is clear that an ideal material should have one or more of the following properties: (a) the presence of a high concentration of polar or accessible unsaturated metal centers on the pore surface (e.g., Ni-DOBDC); (b) narrow uniform pores or pockets with diameters that are slightly larger than the kinetic diameter of the adsorbate (e.g., Co", "3", "(HCOO)", "6", ", CC3, and FMOFCu); (c) the introduction of polarized nanoparticles within the MOF (e.g., Ag@Ni-DOBDC); (d) temperature-dependent separation of the gas mixture (e.g., FMOFCu). Since it is highly unlikely that one single adsorbent will have all of the desired properties, an optimal MOF-based solid-state adsorbent system for Xe/Kr separation might eventually be obtained by a combination approach in which multiple MOF adsorbents are used to separate and capture Xe and Kr from the flue gas stream. We recently reported such a combination approach where a two-MOF system was used to obtain much higher separation performance. As mentioned previously, MOFs are more selective toward Xe over Kr because of the polarizability difference. However, the presence of excess Xe in the stream means that Xe competes for the same adsorption sites in the MOF as Kr. The use of a material with high Xe adsorption capacity (e.g., Ni-DOBDC) first leads to reduction of the concentration of Xe in the flue gas stream. The gas stream can then be flowed through a second material with high Kr selectivity (e.g., FMOFCu) to capture and sequester Kr from the flue gas. Since Xe is no longer present to compete for sorption sites in the adsorbent in the second material, the capacity and selectivity for Kr increases significantly.", "(12, 32)", " Apart from the engineering challenges, the use of advanced computer programs to estimate and analyze the selectivities and capacities for MOF adsorbents is a major breakthrough. Computer simulations give direction for experimentalists to narrow their search for potential MOF structures and compositions from the enormous database or to design a new MOF by novel synthetic strategies. The application of computer simulations in predicting tailor-made MOF morphologies is likely to advance in the future with improvements in software and computing power. Finally, the adsorptive separation of Xe and Kr on porous MOFs is a relatively new research area, and relatively few materials have been evaluated to date. The deliberate tuning of the crystal structure and composition using crystal engineering principles, guided by the results of computational studies, to form MOFs that are tailored specifically for the separation of Xe and Kr is likely to yield further fundamental and applied results in the near future.", " ", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Xenon and Krypton Separation Technologies: Where Do We Stand?", "Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks as Solid-State Adsorbents of Noble Gases", "Future Scope and Outlook", "References", "Supporting Information", "IAST calculations, comparisons of Xe/Kr separations with different MOFs on the basis of breakthrough experiments, transient breakthrough simulations, and a video animation of the transient breakthrough of Xe/Kr with Ag@Ni-DOBDC (AVI).

Stabilizing the carbon dioxide-induced component of climate change is an energy problem.  Establishment of a course toward such stabilization will require the development within the coming decades of primary energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide to the atm., in addn. to efforts to reduce end-use energy demand.  Mid-century primary power requirements that are free of carbon dioxide emissions could be several times what the authors now derive from fossil fuels (\u223c1013 watts), even with improvements in energy efficiency.  Here the authors survey possible future energy sources, evaluated for their capability to supply massive amts. of carbon emission-free energy and for their potential for large-scale commercialization.  Possible candidates for primary energy sources include terrestrial solar and wind energy, solar power satellites, biomass, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, fission-fusion hybrids, and fossil fuels from which carbon was sequestered.  Non-primary power technologies that could contribute to climate stabilization include efficiency improvements, hydrogen prodn., storage and transport, superconducting global elec. grids, and geoengineering.  All of these approaches currently have severe deficiencies that limit their ability to stabilize global climate.

Frameworks (MOFs) contg. open metal sites (OMS) was systematically studied using volumetric gas porosimetry and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation.  The ten MOFs considered are grouped into two series.  The 1st, MOF-74-x, is based upon MOF-74/CPO-27, which has divalent metal ions Mg, Co, Ni, and Zn, and was chosen to explore the effect of metal identity within a const. topol.  The 2nd series, nbo-MOFs, consists of NOTT-100, NOTT-101, NOTT-102, NOTT-103, and PCN-14 and probes the effect of pore size while maintaining const. OMS identity and similar coordination environment.  Comparisons of the nbo-MOFs with HKUST-1 are also made, since this MOF has a similar chem. structure, although the topol. is different from the nbo structures.  Gas uptake and Henry's const. (kH) for nbo-MOFs increase with decreasing pore size, and as pore size decreases, the effect of gas polarizability on kH becomes more profound.  This implies that tailored pore size can strongly influence kH, esp. for the more polarizable gases Kr and Xe.  A detailed anal. of the void space in the nbo-series reveals large cages connected by narrow pores, resulting in tortuous, zigzag diffusion pathways that likely increase the strength of the MOF-gas interaction.  Data for the MOF-74-x series show that both the d. of OMS and their accessibility in this topol. enhance the framework interaction with the noble gases.  However, because the interaction is largely due to (point charge)-(induced-dipole) interactions and the charge on the metal ion varies little, the specific identity of the metal ion is relatively unimportant.  Consequently, new MOFs tailored to maximize noble gas uptake from air should target structures with both a high d. of OMS and pores that are approaching the size of the gas of interest.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXos1Wltb0%253D&md5=afe2dd4e7052e771e1c3bc27cd2446ae", "10.

The generation of metal-org. framework (MOF) coordination polymers enables the tailoring of novel solids with regular porosity from the micro to nanopore scale.  Since the discovery of this new family of nanoporous materials and the concept of so called 'reticular design', nowadays several hundred different types of MOF are known.  The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centers, linked together with a variety of polyat. org. bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mech. stability.

So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.

The NMR experiments are performed at room temperature and over a wide range of xenon pressure and on two different synthesized Cu3(BTC)2 samples. 129Xe NMR results reveal that in dependence on the kind of the synthesis pathway either one or two signals are observed which can be attributed to two kinds of fast exchange of xenon atoms in two pores with different pore sizes.  Coadsorption experiments of xenon and ethylene demonstrate that the xenon atoms prefer to fill the greater pores of the material because the smaller pores are occupied with residual molecules from the synthesis procedure and additionally adsorbed ethylene.  Besides the NMR experiments a series of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements are performed to estimate the state of copper having a strong influence on the chemical shift of the adsorbed xenon.  The EPR experiments demonstrate that spin exchange between the interconnected copper dimers is taking place across the BTC linker molecules in the Cu3(BTC)2 framework.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD28ngtlejsA%253D%253D&md5=be200bf9727d1d8163ee419a434fa48a", "29.

Here, we applied high-throughput computational methods to rapidly explore thousands of possible MOFs, given a library of starting materials, in the context of Xe/Kr sepn.  We generated over 137 000 structurally diverse hypothetical MOFs from a library of chem. building blocks and screened them for Xe/Kr sepn.  For each MOF, we calcd. geometric properties via Delaunay tessellation and predicted thermodn. Xe/Kr adsorption behavior via multicomponent grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations.  Specifically, we calcd. the pore limiting diam., largest cavity diam., accessible void vol., as well as xenon and krypton adsorption at 1.0, 5.0 and 10 bar at 273 K. From these data we show that MOFs with pores just large enough to fit a single xenon atom, and having morphologies resembling tubes of uniform width, are ideal for Xe/Kr sepn.  Finally, we compare our generated MOFs to several known structures (IRMOF-1, HKUST-1, ZIF-8, Pd-MOF, & MOF-505) and conclude that significantly improved materials remain to be synthesized.

The efficacy of nanoporous cryst. materials in sepn. applications is often influenced to a significant extent by diffusion of guest mols. within the pores of the structural frameworks.  The Maxwell-Stefan (M-S) equations provide a fundamental and convenient description of mixt. diffusion.  The M-S formulation highlights two sep. factors that cause mixt. diffusion to be intrinsically coupled: correlation effects, and thermodn. coupling.  By careful and detailed analyses of a variety of published exptl. data on (a) mixt. permeation across nanoporous membranes, (b) transient uptake of mixts. within crystals, and (c) transient breakthrough characteristics of fixed bed adsorbers, we identify conditions that require the use of M-S equations including both correlation effects and thermodn. coupling.  Situations are also identified in which either of the coupling effects can be ignored.  Correlation effects cause slowing-down of more-mobile-less-strongly-adsorbed mols. by tardier-more-strongly-adsorbed-partner species; such slowing-down effects are often essential for modeling mixt. permeation across nanoporous membranes.  Overshoots in the transient uptake of the more mobile partners in single crystals are essentially the consequence of thermodn. coupling, originating from sizable off-diagonal elements of thermodn. correction factors \u0393ij.
