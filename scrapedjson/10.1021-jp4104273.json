Clearly CH", "4", " adsorption in M-DOBDC is generally weaker than for CO", "2", ". Nevertheless, several trends are shared between these two adsorbates. For example, adsorption in the 3d metals is strongest for the early transition metals (Sc, Ti, V). Moving to the right in the periodic table, the interaction weakens for Cr and then roughly strengthens again as one continues across the 3d series. The trends between CO", "2", " and CH", "4", " are also similar for the alkaline and alkaline earth metals, where Mg, Ca, and Sr exhibit relatively strong adsorptive interactions with both molecules. A shared exception is the lower binding energy for Be-DOBDC. Upon relaxation, Be becomes buried (and therefore inaccessible) inside the MOF structure, preventing direct interactions with the adsorbed guest molecule, and resulting in less exothermic adsorption enthalpies. Consequently, a site slightly displaced toward the ligand is the preferred location for CO", "2", " adsorption in Be-DOBDC.", "(34)", "Electronic Structure", "The different magnitudes of the adsorption enthalpies for CO", "2", " versus CH", "4", " on M-DOBDC can be attributed to differences in the strength of electrostatic interactions between the CUS and the adsorbate molecules. Although neither CO", "2", " nor CH", "4", " possesses a permanent dipole, they differ in their polarizability and distribution of atomic charges.

[Due to its unique adsorption geometry (as discussed previously), these correlations often do not hold for Sn-DOBDC.] In addition, Figure S3b in the ", "Supporting Information", " shows that \u0394", "H", " weakly correlates with the ionic radius of the CUS, in cases where the radius is relatively small (<1.0 \u00c5). This trend can be explained as follows: In the adsorbed MOF complexes, hydrogen from CH", "4", " is in close proximity to the carboxyl oxygen atoms on the MOF, while the carbon from CH", "4", " approaches the MOF\u2019s CUS. Such an arrangement minimizes the separation between pairs of oppositely charged (attracting) atoms. An increase to the ionic radius of the CUS elongates metal\u2013O bonds in the MOF and allows the bulky CH", "4", " to approach the framework more closely. This has the effect of minimizing these bond lengths and increasing the strength of interaction.

To probe these, calculations were performed at several alternative adsorption sites in Ni-DOBDC. The three sites identified as being most energetically favorable are illustrated in Figure S2 in the ", "Supporting Information", ". We find that the adsorption energy at the carboxyl oxygen site (", "Supporting Information", ", Figure S2b) adjacent to the CUS is comparable to that at the CUS: the carboxyl site is only 0.3 kJ/mol less favorable (\u0394", "E", " = \u221223.6 kJ/mol) than the CUS site (", "Supporting Information", ", Figure S2a, \u0394", "E", " = \u221223.9 kJ/mol), likely due to the fact that CH", "4", " maintains a similar bond length (3.54 \u00c5) to the CUS in this position. Binding to the aromatic ring C-site (", "Supporting Information", ", Figure S2c) is somewhat weaker: \u0394", "E", " = \u221220.6 kJ/mol.

With considerable sources available and low pollution factor, methane is a natural choice as petroleum replacement in cars and other mobile applications.

Advanced porous materials, metal-org. frameworks and porous org. polymers, have received considerable attention in sorptive storage applications owing to their exceptionally high surface areas and chem.-tunable structures.

Here, in the context of methane storage, the first large-scale, quant. structure-property relationship (QSPR) anal. of MOFs is reported.  The effect is investigated of geometrical features, such as pore size and void fraction, on the simulated methane storage capacities of \u223c130 000 hypothetical MOFs at 1, 35, and 100 bar at 298 K.  From these data models are developed that can predict methane storage with high accuracy, based only on knowledge of the geometric features.  Several models were developed: multilinear regression (MLR) models, decision trees (DTs), and nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs).  In each case, 10 000 MOF structures were used to \"train\" the QSPR regression models, and the accuracy of the predictions was evaluated on a test set of \u223c120 000 MOFs.  The nonlinear SVM models can predict the methane storage capacity of MOFs in the test set with R2 values of 0.82 and 0.93 at 35 and 100 bar, resp.

(HKUST-1, PCN-11, and PCN-14) the CH4 storage capacities of which are among the highest reported so far among all porous materials.  The three MOFs consist of the same dicopper paddle-wheel secondary building units, but contain different org. linkers, leading to cagelike pores with various sizes and geometries.  From neutron powder diffraction expts. and accurate data anal., assisted by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and DFT calcns., we unambiguously revealed the exact locations of the stored methane mols. in these MOF materials.  We found that methane uptake takes place primarily at two types of strong adsorption site: (1) the open Cu coordination sites, which exhibit enhanced Coulomb attraction toward methane, and (2) the van der Waals potential pocket sites, in which the total dispersive interactions are enhanced due to the mol. being in contact with multiple \"surfaces.\".  Interestingly, the enhanced van der Waals sites are present exclusively in small cages and at the windows to these cages, whereas large cages with relatively flat pore surfaces bind very little methane.  Our results suggest that further, rational development of new MOF compds. for methane storage applications should focus on enriching open metal sites, increasing the vol. percentage of accessible small cages and channels, and minimizing the fraction of large pores.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXltlWgtb0%253D&md5=8f6059d2e137ca23fb5eeb17d127be74", "31.

A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common d. functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported.

Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for std. functionals.  In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean abs. deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1.  The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the av. CCSD(T) accuracy.  The basic strategy in the development to restrict the d. functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interat. distances by damped C6\u00b7R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions.  As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference.

In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its abs. values, as it is currently done with mol.

For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional mol.
