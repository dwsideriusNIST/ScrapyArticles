Introduction A proper description of diffusion of molecules within nanoporous materials such as zeolites, carbon nanotubes, and metal\u2212organic frameworks is required in many potential separation and reaction applications.1-5 The Maxwell\u2212Stefan formulation for single component diffusion in zeolites is commonly expressed as  where Ni is the molar flux expressed in mol m-2 s-1, \u03c1 is the zeolite framework density expressed in kg m-3, qi is the molar loading expressed in mol kg-1, d\u03bci/dx is the chemical potential gradient, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in K, and \u0110i is the Maxwell\u2212Stefan (M-S) diffusivity, or \u201ccorrected\u201d diffusivity of species i. In several classic publications on the subject of diffusion in zeolites, it has been customary to assume that \u0110i is independent of the loading qi within the zeolite.6 However, in recent years there has been increasing evidence, both from experiments7-10 and from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations11-16 that \u0110i is generally a strong function of loading. For any given molecule, say CH4, the \u0110i\u2212qi relation appears to be dependent both on the zeolite topology and connectivity.11,17-20 For zeolites structures consisting of cages separated by narrow windows, such as LTA, CHA, ERI, and DDR, the \u0110i increases sharply with loading qi, reaches a maximum, and eventually decreases to near-zero values as the saturation loading qi,sat is approached.13,17,18,21 The loading-dependence in such structures has been interpreted in terms of a reduction in the free energy barrier for intercage hopping with increased intracage occupancy.18 The approach of Reed and Ehrlich22 has been applied to cage-type zeolite structures to yield a simple analytical model to describe the dependence of \u0110i on fractional occupancy \u03b8i, defined as  The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the loading-dependence of \u0110i in a (Si0.061Al0.483P0.455)O2 (SAPO-34) (an isotype of CHA) membrane by carrying out unary permeation experiments with a variety of light gases (He, H2, CO2, N2, O2, CO, Ar, and CH4). For this purpose, experiments in an improved membrane were performed with upstream pressures ranging to 7.2 MPa to ensure high occupancies in the membrane. The membrane synthesis procedure used in the present study used a seeding procedure that resulted in a thinner membrane and higher fluxes than obtained in a previous study.23 The details of membrane synthesis, characterization, measurement procedures along with the experimental data have been given in the Supporting Information. The current work supplements the unary permeation data for CO2, N2, and CH4 reported in our earlier publication.24  In our earlier publication,24 we had analyzed experimental data on permeation of binary mixtures CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and CH4/N2 and concluded that for modeling purposes, the binary exchange coefficient \u011012 in the M-S formulation is best taken to have a large enough value to ensure that intercage jumps of molecules occur independently of one another. In the current work, we report additional binary permeation data for H2/CH4, H2/N2, and H2/CO mixtures to examine whether the conclusion reached in the earlier paper on independent intercage hopping  of molecules holds also for mixtures containing H2. Furthermore, we report data for ternary CO2/CH4/N2 mixture permeation experiments and examine whether the M-S formulation with infinite binary exchange coefficients \u0110ij for each of the binary pairs is successful in predicting the permeation fluxes in the ternary mixture.

ConclusionsSupporting Information Available2. Fitting of Pure Component Isotherms Adsorption experiments were carried out in an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome Corp. Model AS1-C\u2212VP-RGA) system. The experimental pure component isotherms for pure CO2, CH4, N2, CO, Ar, O2, and H2 at 295 K are plotted in Figure 1a\u2212c. For adsorption in zeolite structures with cages separated by narrow windows, such as SAPO-34, the model based on statistical thermodynamics described in Chapter 3 of Ruthven25 is particularly relevant and useful.  In eq 3, qi represents the loading in mol kg-1, qi,sat is the saturation loading, and \u03a9i is maximum capacity expressed in molecules per cage. On the basis of the atomic composition of SAPO-34 used in our experiments, (Si0.061Al0.483P0.455)O2, we calculate   It is important to have a good estimate of the saturation capacity, qi,sat, but it is not possible to obtain this information from experimental isotherm data because the pressures at which the pores get saturated can range to about 109 Pa; our experimental isotherms were only determined to a maximum pressure of 110 kPa. For CO2 for example, the molar volume of the liquid phase at 109 Pa is estimated to lie in the range of 30\u221235 cm3/mol from the data given by M\u00e4der and Berman.26 Golden and Sircar27 estimate the molar volumes for H2, CO2, N2, Ar, and CH4 to be 22.6, 33.3, 37.7, 26.3, and 31.6 cm3/mol, respectively. Of these gases, CO2 has the highest adsorption strength and the loading of CO2 at the highest pressures used in the feed in the permeation experiments, to be discussed below, will be close to its saturation value. For the measured pore volume of 0.26 cm3/g, the maximum capacity after rounding off to integer values is estimated to be 6 molecules per cage for CO2, corresponding to 8.2 mol kg-1. For H2, using the value of 22.6 cm3/mol for the molar volume results in a saturation capacity after rounding off of \u03a9i = 9 molecules per cage.

Analysis of Unary Permeation Data If the M-S diffusivity \u0110i can be taken to be loading-independent, we may write the permeation flux as  where DFi is the driving force  where fi,up and fi,down represent the pressures (more strictly, fugacities) of component i at the upstream (retentate) and downstream (permeate) sides of the membrane. For He permeation, with eq 5 describing the adsorption isotherm in the Henry regime, the DFi can be calculated from  For all other gases, the adsorption isotherms are described by eq 3 and the integral in eq 7 can be evaluated analytically to obtain   Plots of the unary permeation fluxes for He and H2 against the driving force DFi are shown in Figure 2. The linear dependence of the flux Ni on DFi confirms that the assumption of a loading-independent \u0110i is a good one for He and H2. The straight lines have been drawn taking the fitted value of \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 = 0.322 and 0.293 kg m-2 s-1 for He and H2, respectively.   Figure 2 The experimental data on unary permeation fluxes for He and H2 are plotted against the driving force DFi, calculated from eq 8 for He or eq 9 for H2. The straight lines have been drawn taking the fitted value of \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 = 0.322 and 0.293 kg m-2 s-1 for He and H2, respectively.   The plots of Ni vs DFi for CO2, N2, O2, CO, Ar, and CH4 are shown in Figure 3a,b. For none of these gases is the Ni\u2212DFi relationship precisely linear. This is more clearly evident in Figure 4a,b in which the values of the transport coefficients, \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4, backed out using eq 6, are plotted against the component loading at the upstream face of the membrane, qi,up. For all gases, the \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 appears to increase with qi,up. For CO2, a slight maximum is also detectable at an upstream loading of 6 mol kg-1 beyond which the \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 appears to decrease with increasing qi,up.   Figure 3 The plots of Ni vs DFi for (a) CO2, N2, O2, CO, Ar, and (b) CH4.   The values of transport coefficients \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 shown in Figure 4a,b do not reflect the true M-S diffusivities \u0110i because they are based on eqs 6 and 7, which are derived assuming \u0110i is independent of loading qi. The proper procedure for backing out the M-S diffusivities is to first establish the correct \u0110i\u2212qi dependence. To quantify the loading-dependence, we use the model developed by Reed and Ehrlich;21,22,29 this model gives the following expression   where z is the coordination number, representing the maximum number of neighbors within a cage; we take z = 5 (i.e., one less than the maximum capacity of molecules that can be accommodated in each cage). The other parameters are defined as (see Krishna et al.21 for more detailed discussions and derivations)    Figure 4 Transport coefficients \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 backed out using eq 6 (a) CO2, N2, O2, CO, Ar, and (b) CH4.   With the Reed\u2212Ehrlich loading-dependence, we may define a modified driving force MDFi  The integration must be carried out numerically. The modified driving force must be expected to bear a linear relation with the permeation flux  The plots for CO2, N2, CO, O2, Ar, and CH4 are shown in Figure 5a\u2212c. The Reed\u2212Ehrlich parameter \u03c6i was chosen to yield a straight line relationship; the best fit values of \u03c6i that yield linear dependencies of Ni on MDFi are listed in Table 2 along with the corresponding zero-loading transport coefficients \u03c1\u0110i(0)/\u03b4.   Figure 5 The experimental data on unary permeation fluxes of (a) CO2, (b) N2, CO, O2, Ar and (c) CH4 is plotted against the modified driving force MDFi, calculated from eq 12, taking the parameter values specified in Table 2. The straight lines are drawn using eq 13 with fitted values of \u03c1\u0110i(0)/\u03b4 specified in Table 2.

For CO2, N2, CO, and Ar, the molecular diameter is in the 3\u22123.4 \u00c5 range and the \u03c1\u0110i(0)/\u03b4 appear to decrease with increasing molecular length; see Figure 7b. The loading- dependence is stronger when the molecular diameter is larger; see Figure 7c.

Modeling of Mixture Permeation The M-S equations13,34,35  are widely used for modeling and interpretation of zeolite membrane permeation experiments for a variety of molecules and mixtures.3,36,37 In eq 14, \u0110i is the M-S diffusivity of species i in the mixture, qi is the molar loading, qi,sat is the saturation capacity of species i, \u0110ij are the binary exchange coefficients. The major advantage of using the M-S equations is that the diffusion coefficients \u0110i and \u0110ij can be estimated from pure component adsorption and diffusion data.13,35 Zhu et al.38 and Li et al.23 have modeled permeation of CO2 (1)\u2212CH4 (2) mixtures across MFI and SAPO-34 membranes, respectively by estimating that the binary exchange parameter \u0110ij using the interpolation formula.  On the basis of MD simulations of diffusion in CO2\u2212CH4 mixtures, Krishna et al.21,32 have argued that in zeolite structures that consist of cages separated by narrow windows, such as CHA and DDR, intercage jumps are uncorrelated and that as an approximation, the binary exchange coefficient \u011012 can be taken to be infinite, that is  SAPO-34 is an isotype of CHA and the same approximation may be expected to hold. The gradient of the chemical potentials in eq 16 can be related to the gradients in the loadings by defining a matrix of thermodynamic factors [\u0393]  The elements \u0393ij in eq 17 can be estimated using the ideal-adsorbed solution theory of Myers and Prausnitz39 and the fits  of the pure component isotherms. Integrating eq 17 across the membrane thickness we obtain  The details of the numerical procedures for calculation of the fluxes are described in earlier work.3,40  Before proceeding with the estimation of the fluxes Ni using the pure component data on the transport coefficients listed in Table 2, we shall demonstrate the applicability of the uncoupled M-S equations (18) by backing out the transport diffusivity \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 as a function of the total upstream loading, qup = q1,up + q2,up, for the six binary mixture permeation experiments using   The results are presented in Figure 8a\u2212f, along with the backed-out transport coefficients from unary permeation experiments (reported in Figure 4a,b). For the (a) CO2/CH4, (b) CO2/N2, and (c) CH4/N2 mixtures, we note that the \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 backed out either from pure component or mixture permeation experiments exhibit similar loading-dependences and correspond closely to each other. This confirms that the assumption of infinite value for the binary exchange parameter \u011012 is a good one. A slightly different picture emerges for the mixture containing H2. From the \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 data for CH4/H2, N2/H2, and CO/H2 mixtures (see Figure 8d\u2212f), there appears to be a slight slowing-down of the more mobile H2 with a concomitant and small speeding-up of the more tardy species, CH4, N2, and CO in the three binary mixtures, respectively. This would indicate that the assumption of an infinite value of \u011012 is not as good for mixtures with hydrogen and must be viewed only as an approximation.   Figure 8 Comparison of transport coefficients, \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4, backed out from unary permeation and binary mixtures containing (a) CO2/CH4, (b) CO2/N2, (c) N2/CH4, (d) CH4/H2, (e) N2/H2, and (f) CO/H2.   Figure 9 Permeation fluxes for binary (a) CO2/CH4, (b) CO2/N2, and (c) N2/CH4 mixtures as function of the upstream total pressure, fup. The continuous solid lines represent the calculations by numerical solution of eq 18.   It now remains to compare the estimate of the permeation fluxes in the mixture from eq 18 with experimental values. The  M-S diffusivity \u0110i of component i in the mixture is estimated on the basis of the total mixture occupancy, \u03b8, defined by  and the Reed\u2212Ehrlich model, eq 10, and the pure component transport data in Table 2. Figure 9a\u2212c shows that the estimations of Ni using eq 18 for (a) CO2/CH4, (b) CO2/N2, and (c) CH4/N2 mixtures are in very good agreement with experimental values (filled solid symbols) for the entire range of upstream pressure conditions. This result is to be expected in view of the good agreement in the backed-out transport coefficients \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 of mixtures with that of pure component data; cf. Figure 8a\u2212c.  Figure 10a shows the experimentally determined fluxes for the ternary CO2/CH4/N2 mixture as a function of the upstream total pressure. The predictions of the M-S mixture model (eq 18), shown by the continuous solid lines in Figure 10a, are in good agreement with experiment. Figure 10b shows the experimentally determined permeation selectivity \u03b1perm defined by  for CO2/CH4 and N2/CH4 separation in the ternary mixture. Inclusion of the binary exchange coefficients \u0110ij, estimated using eq 15 in the M-S equation (14), will have the effect of slowing-down the \u201cfaster\u201d molecules, while concomitantly speeding-up the \u201ctardier\u201d molecules. These predictions are shown by the dashed lines in Figure 10b; for both mixtures this leads to a significantly poorer match with experiments. For CO2/CH4 and N2/CH4 mixtures, allowance for a finite binary exchange coefficient \u0110ij predicts a significantly lower \u03b1perm than in the experiments because in both these cases we have slowing-down of the more mobile CO2, or N2, and concomitant speeding-up of the tardy CH4. The conclusion to be drawn from the results presented in Figure 10b is that intercage hopping of molecules CO2, CH4, and N2 within SAPO-34 occurs independent of one other and validates the use of the simplified M-S equation (18). There is no perceptible slowing-down or speeding-up process. The window size of SAPO-34 is of the order of 3.8 \u00c5, and  only one molecule can pass through the window at a time. The intercage hopping of molecules between cages is uncorrelated, and the three binary exchange coefficients \u0110ij all have large values.

The continuous solid lines represent the calculations by the numerical solution of eq 18 across the membrane. The dashed lines represent integration of eqs 14 and 15 across the membrane.

The continuous solid lines represent the calculations by numerical solution of eq 18 across the membrane.   We now turn to permeation of the mixture containing H2; the measured fluxes for binary (a) CH4/H2, (b) N2/H2, and (c) CO/H2 mixtures with equimolar feed mixture compositions are shown in Figure 11a\u2212c (filled solid symbols) as a function of the total upstream pressure, fup. The model calculations are indicated by continuous solid lines in Figure 11. For all three binary mixtures, the fluxes are predicted with reasonable accuracy using only pure component diffusivity and isotherm data. We note, however, that for all three mixtures the fluxes of H2 are slightly overestimated; the reason for this is that there is a slight slowing-down of H2 in the mixture due to the presence of the tardy companion species (CH4, N2, or CO) as was stressed earlier; cf. Figure 8d\u2212f. We see also note that the estimation of the fluxes of CH4, N2, and CO are slightly lower than found experimentally; this is due to the slight speeding-up of these tardier components. The assumption of infinite exchange \u011012 is to be considered as a reasonable, but not perfect, approximation for hydrogen containing mixtures.   Top of PageAbstract1. Introduction2.

Conclusions The following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this paper.  (1) The M-S diffusivities \u0110i of He, H2, CO2, N2, O2, CO, Ar, and CH4 in SAPO-34 have been backed out using unary permeation data. While the assumption of a loading-independent \u0110i is valid for He and H2, the M-S diffusivities of CO2, N2, O2, CO, Ar, and CH4 are all significantly loading-dependent.  (2) The model of Reed\u2212Ehrlich provides a convenient practical procedure for modeling the loading-dependence of \u0110i; the severity of the loading-dependence is captured in this model by the parameter \u03c6i. The larger the diameter is of the molecule, the stronger the loading-dependence is.  (3) Binary CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, CH4/N2, and ternary CO2/CH4/N2 mixture permeation in SAPO-34 is best modeled by the M-S equation (18) wherein the intercage hopping of molecules is taken to be independent of one another. This corresponds with the assumption of an infinite exchange coefficient \u0110ij.  (4) For permeation of binary mixtures H2/CH4, H2/N2, and H2/CO, the assumption of infinite exchange coefficient \u011012 is not a perfect one; there is a slight slowing-down of mobile H2 with concomitant speeding-up of the tardier CH4, N2, or CO. Even so, the estimations of the fluxes using eq 18 are in reasonably good agreement with experiment.    Top of PageAbstract1. Introduction2. Fitting of Pure Component Isotherms3.
