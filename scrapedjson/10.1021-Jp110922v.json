On the contrary, the carbon resonance at 100 ppm, which shifted to 108, 110, and 112 ppm when the in situ treatment temperature was increased to 373, 398, and 423 K, respectively, suggests that the paramagnetic effect of the copper center on this carbon becomes stronger as the temperature increases. It is certain that the aforementioned resonance comes from a nonprotonated carbon as concluded by the dipolar dephasing measurements and therefore should correspond to either the nonprotonated carbons from the pzdc ring or the carboxylate groups. In the pzdc ring (Figure ", "7", "), there are two nonprotonated carbons: (1) one that connects to the N atom that chelates with a Cu atom and (2) another that bonds with the N atom that is far away from the copper centers. Consequently, the latter will remain sterically distanced from the copper center, and any paramagnetism effect will be limited, which leads to the conclusion that the resonance observed at 100 ppm should correspond to this carbon. The former nonprotonated carbon would be close to the copper center and, like the carbons in the carboxyl groups, should not be present in the spectra. A plausible explanation for this behavior is that a mutual slide took place between the two sheets of Cu", "2+", "(pzdc)", "2\u2212", " that form the neutral layers of the structure, causing the aforementioned carbons to move closer or farther from the copper nodes.

Hydrogen is expected to play an important role in future transportation as a promising alternative clean energy source to carbon-based fuels.  One of the key challenges to commercialize hydrogen energy is to develop appropriate onboard hydrogen storage systems, capable of charging and discharging large quantities of hydrogen with fast enough kinetics to meet com. requirements.  Metal org. framework (MOF) is a new type of inorg. and org. hybrid nanoporous particulate materials.  Its diverse networks can enhance hydrogen storage through tuning the structure and property of MOFs.  The MOF materials so far developed adsorb hydrogen through weak dispersion interactions, which allow significant quantity of hydrogen to be stored at cryogenic temps. with fast kinetics.

The effective activation temp. range was estd. via coupled thermal gravimetric and Fourier transforms IR spectroscopy anal.  A textural property anal. via the \u03b1s-plot, Dubinin-Radushkevich and Horvath-Kawazoe methods show that a significant redn. in effective surface area and micropore vol. occurs when the activation temp. is increased from 373 to 423 K.  Cooling of the sample in a moisture-free environment revealed that such redn. is nonreversible, as evidenced by single-component CO2 equil. adsorption tests.  Although CO2 equil. adsorption isotherms exhibit a linear behavior in the ambient pressure range, an increase in activation temp. eventually decreases the pore size of the structure resulting in a considerable decrease in loading amts.  This was also corroborated by means of in situ high-temp. X-ray diffraction, which was used to monitor the lattice semiquant. changes of CPL-2 during the thermal activation sequence.  In addn., adsorption uptake data was gathered to est. a diffusion time const. and elucidate preliminary information about the kinetics involved during the transport of CO2 through the micropores of CPL-2.  After inspection of the adsorbent particle morphol. via SEM, it became ostensible that the transport phenomenol. model suitable to fit the uptake data was that of a slab-shape particle.  For the sample pretreated at 373 K the anal. yields an av. diffusion time const. of ca. 0.5 s-1 at 298 K.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhvVGrtA%253D%253D&md5=746f86881c0c754175bc004323f3660d", "40.
