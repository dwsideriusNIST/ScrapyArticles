In addn., biomedical applications or the use as sensor materials are currently intensively investigated.  Although MOF synthesis was originally set out for making new compds. and structures with interesting properties, the field has matured and is broadening its scope.  This holds for the synthesis methods applied as well as the areas of application.  While conventional syntheses methods have been widely used, the fields of mechano-, sono-, and electrochem. synthesis as well as microwave-assisted syntheses are just emerging.

However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

Layers of the 2,2'-bipyridine compd. are formed through hydrogen bonding of the phosphonic acid groups existing in the dianionic motif {1,3-[(OH)PO2]2-5-[PO(OH)2]-C6H3}2-.  The ratio of BTP to 2,2'-bipyridine is 1:1.5, with two of the phosphonic acid protons being transferred to the nitrogen atoms, leaving a neg. charged oxygen and a proton on each of the phosphonic acid groups.  Discrete dimers are formed by three very short PO-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O-P type hydrogen bonds (2.45-2.48 \u00c5) and one short PO-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O:P hydrogen bond at 2.56 \u00c5 interconnecting all dimers into extended layers in the bc plane.  The protonated bipyridyls penetrated into the layers by formation of two NH+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O-P hydrogen bonds (2.72, 3.14 \u00c5) to complete the 3D network.  The compd. with 4,4'-bipyridine is triclinic P\u203e1, in which the ratio of BTP to bipyridine is 1:1.  Each amino nitrogen atom is protonated, leaving each phosphonic acid group neg. charged.  One addnl. pos. charge is provided by a hydronium ion.  The BTP mols. align in hydrogen-bonded staircase chains along the b axis, in which the mols. are bonded together by double hydrogen bonds: P-O-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7HO-P.  The staircases are then interwoven into each other by the NH+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O-P hydrogen bonds between the pyridyl and the phosphonic acid groups.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXntVOlu7o%253D&md5=2071d66cfd366a9ff7edfb99bedeabdc", "13.

The x-ray structures at different degrees of desolvation indicate the highly flexible nature of the framework.  The framework deformations involve slippage of the layers and movement of the two interpenetrated frameworks with respect to each other.  The coordination geometry of a zinc paddle-wheel unit (one of the popular SBUs) is considerably changed by bond breaking between zinc and oxygen atoms during the drying process.  Two zinc atoms in the dried form 2d reside in a distorted tetrahedral geometry.  Compd. 2d has no void vol. and favors the uptake of O2 over Ar and N2 at 77 K.  The O2 and Ar adsorption isotherms of 2d show gate-opening-type adsorption behaviors corroborating the structure detn.  The CO2 adsorption isotherm at 195 K exhibits multiple steps originating from the flexibility of the framework.
