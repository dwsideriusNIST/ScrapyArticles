Throughout the rest of WWI, chemical warfare became a major focus with the development of first-generation chemical agents, such as the vesicant (or blistering agent) sulfur mustard, the blood agents hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride, and the choking agents phosgene and diphosgene, among others.", "(2, 3)", "The dawn of modern chemical weaponry during and immediately following WWI resulted in the development of highly toxic compounds. Chlorine is a chemical with easy access yet relatively high toxicity compared to many other industrial compounds. In the 1930s, Germany discovered highly toxic organophosphates while investigating new pesticides. These chemicals, later known as G-type nerve agents, include tabun (GA), sarin (GB), and soman (GD), among others. These compounds were found to be highly toxic due to irreversible binding with the nerve sites responsible for acetylcholinesterase breakdown, a necessary process in neurotransmission.", "(4)", " Although never used on the battlefield during World War II (WWII), Germany manufactured and stockpiled these chemicals before and during the war, the formulas of which were captured by the Allies after the war.", "After WWII, G-type nerve agents were mass produced, and in the early 1950s V-type nerve agents were discovered in the United Kingdom. In particular, VX [", "O", "-ethyl ", "S", "-(2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl) methylphosphonothioate] was found to be one of the most lethal substances known and was produced by several nations in large quantities. Today, these toxic chemicals are still being demilitarized in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. It is possible that these chemicals were used in various conflicts in the subsequent decades, and they were almost certainly used by Iraq against Iran in the 1980s. In 1995, the Aum Shinrikyo cult released sarin nerve gas within the Tokyo subway system, killing several civilians and injuring many more. This incident showed a possible expansion in the use of chemical weapons from state-sanctioned to asymmetric terrorism. Even today, the threat of nerve agents continues to resonate with conflicts such as those in Syria, where the United Nations believes sarin was used.", "1.2", "Current Toxic Chemical Protection Requirements", "Although the threat of traditional nerve and vesicant chemical warfare agents (CWAs) remains, a recent emphasis has been placed on protection against toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine, coming full circle from the initial release in Ypres. The omnipresence of TICs represents a potential hazard, often requiring the use of air-purifying respirators when working in their vicinity to mitigate potential hazards. In regard to asymmetric warfare, militants and insurgents could obtain large tankers of chemicals for use against civilian and military personnel.", "Between these extremes, the increased use of chemicals in industry inevitably results in the increased risk of an accidental release. Perhaps the most notorious chemical incident in recent history was the release of methyl isocyanate, an extremely toxic compound used as an intermediate in pesticide production, from a chemical plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984. Recently, train derailments in South Carolina and The District of Columbia resulted in the accidental release of chlorine. Ammonia removal has been of concern most recently following a fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, in 2013.", "Within the past 15 years, the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has established a set of standards for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) protection for air-purifying respirators for first responders.", "(5)", " The availability and possible use of TICs in chemical warfare has been further investigated by the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO CBD) within the United States Department of Defense over the past decade.

Fibrous media are generally used to remove solid and liquid aerosols from air by mechanical means, while microporous sorbents are used to remove gaseous and vaporous components. In WWI, military personnel used urine soaked rags, a device of opportunity, to protect themselves from chlorine gas, as it reacted with the ammonia in the urine. Military respirators were quickly designed during WWI, and activated carbons have been almost exclusively used as the sorbent for gas and vapor removal in the century since the initial gas attacks.

Thus, early gas masks were large, bulky, and burdensome to ensure proper protection for the user. Over the past century, the gas mask has changed substantially many times focused on the purported threat of the day.", "(12)", " The current push is to provide more protection than previous systems, but in a smaller volume to reduce the burden to the user.", "Figure 1. A sampling of gas masks used in the United States: (a) the M1A2 Mask developed after WWI, (b) the M3A1 Series Lightweight Mask developed during WWII, (c) the M17 Mask developed after WWII, (d) the M28 Riot Control Mask developed during the 1960s, (e) the M40 Series Mask developed in the 1980s, and (f) the M50 Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) developed in the 1990s and fielded in the 2000s. As masks have been developed in the United States and worldwide, a premium has been placed on lowering the burden while maintaining a protective posture. Photos of the gas masks are courtesy of the U.S. Army.", "With the changes in gas masks, changes to the sorbents have also occurred to develop the technology into new shapes and smaller sizes. Activated carbon has been modified with a variety of compounds, commonly known as impregnants, to react with higher-volatility (vapor pressure greater than 100 Torr) compounds. These impregnants have included metal salts, acids, and amines.", "(13, 14)", " The current state-of-the-art U.S. military filters use a carbon impregnated with copper, silver, zinc, molybdenum, and triethylenediamine (TEDA), known as ASZM-TEDA carbon.", "A wide range of sorbents and filters are used in industry, frequently varying in impregnant formulation to optimize protection for specific chemicals or applications. However, within the U.S. military only a handful of respirators are used, and all individual and collective protection filters utilize ASZM-TEDA carbon. Developing new materials for military or first responder applications poses a much more difficult endeavor than industrial applications, simply because the chemical threat is typically unknown before an event occurs. Thus, the development of new materials for enhanced filtration traditionally falls into two categories: a highly specific, highly efficient material targeting one chemical or group (e.g., acid gases) or a material possessing the ability to remove a broad range of chemical threats, with less protection against specific chemicals.", "Although the ability to remove toxic chemicals is paramount, it is not the only performance parameter required of sorbents. Sorbents must possess the ability to withstand prolonged periods of high levels of moisture as well as high temperatures with limited degradation prior to use. During use, adsorbent materials must also be able to remove toxic chemicals at a full range of ambient temperature and humidity conditions, depending on the mode of operation. Furthermore, filters undergo rough handling during usage; therefore, sorbents must also have sufficient hardness such that they do not create dust, which would result in bed channeling and increased pressure drop. Although many materials by themselves are relatively soft, binders may be employed to enhance stability during rough handling. Resistance to attrition of engineered materials is vital to reduce breathing resistance attributed to smaller particles. Finally, sorbents must be able to remove chemicals with minimal material to minimize breathing resistance. In short, materials used in air purification applications must provide substantial protection while balancing weight, volume, hardness, and resistance to aging.", "1.2.2", "Sorbent Evaluation for Filters", "Sorbents used in air purification applications are commonly evaluated for total capacity and/or breakthrough time. The total capacity of a material is typically based on an adsorption isotherm, which measures the amount of the chemical of interest that sorbs on the material as a function of pressure at a constant temperature. These experiments are conducted at equilibrium and indicate the ability of a sorbent to retain a chemical at a wide range of partial pressures. In filtration applications, low-pressure isotherms are used to determine adsorbate uptake, as filtration is mostly an ambient process and the removal of trace amounts of toxic chemicals is paramount. In particular, adsorbate interactions at very low partial pressures indicate how an adsorbate interacts with the material\u2019s surface and is relevant to how a material will behave within a filter.", "Breakthrough experiments are another means of evaluating the efficacy of a sorbent to remove a chemical and typically are more applicable to filters, which operate in dynamic, flow-through, conditions. This information is used to determine the protection afforded by a particular filter in an air-purifying respirator or a collective protection system. The basic concept of the breakthrough experiment is the introduction of a sorbate through a packed sorbent bed. As the sorbate begins eluting from the packed bed, the protection afforded by the sorbent can be determined by the time it takes the chemical to reach a predetermined toxic limit, known as the breakthrough time. It is imperative that developmental materials be evaluated against a wide range of low- and high-volatility chemicals to determine an envelope of protection.", "1.3", "Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks", "While traditional activated carbons have proven highly effective at removing a wide range of toxic chemicals, one potential shortcoming is the method of incorporating reactive functional groups. To properly afford broad spectrum protection, activated carbons must be impregnated with a variety of compounds capable of both acidic and basic chemistries. Due to the proximity of complementary functionalities within the pores of carbons, these chemical groups will inherently interact with one another over time, reducing the efficacy of the material. Instead, covalently anchoring functional groups to the substrate may be advantageous, a property that can be imparted through crystal design of materials, such as metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs).", "More than 6000 three-dimensional MOFs, also known as coordination polymers, are currently registered in the Cambridge Structural Database.

In contemporary nomenclature, CWAs typically refer to nerve and vesicant agents, although the full list is far more extensive. Nerve agents, such as sarin (GB), soman (GD), and VX, and vesicants, such as sulfur mustard (HD) and lewisite (L), are generally more of a percutaneous (skin) hazard; however, all have at least some volatility and can be lethal if inhaled in sufficient quantity. Thus, all must be considered during filter design. Although degradation studies with CWAs such as nerve and blister agents are often conducted in the liquid phase, the reaction chemistry mechanism remains the same for vapor removal. As compared to TICs, relatively few removal mechanism studies have been conducted on CWAs and their surrogates. Studies on CWAs are typically concerned with reaction kinetics, as CWAs are typically less volatile than TICs and can be a more persistent threat.", "The removal of HD, bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, as well as the HD simulant 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) on Cu\u2013BTC was investigated by Roy et al.", "(45)", " The rate constant and half-life for HD removal were found to be 0.020 min", "\u20131", " and 34.65 min, respectively, while CEES was removed more quickly, with a rate constant and half-life of 0.043 min", "\u20131", " and 16.11 min, respectively.

At this point, individual MOFs have shown efficacy toward specific gases; however, a full set of design rules has yet to be established to synthesize MOFs with the ability to remove a broad spectrum of toxic gases. The tailorability of MOFs can be exploited to design such materials, which has always been a challenge for activated carbons and other traditional filtration media. MOFs provide the opportunity for modification of the SBU and the organic linkers to target interactions with various classes of chemicals. Linkers with various functional groups can be incorporated into a single MOF, as in the MTV (multivariate) MOFs explored by Deng et al.", "(231)", " MOFs with CUSs have shown potential for the adsorption of analytes with available electrons; however, many of these MOFs, including Cu\u2013BTC and MOF-74 analogues, are not water stable, which is a fundamental requirement for use in filters. The use of these types of MOFs in filters will require postsynthetic modification to increase their hydrostability.", "One major shortcoming of comparing different MOFs against the variety of adsorbates studied in this review is the lack of consistent parameters used during sorbent evaluation. For air purification purposes, materials must be evaluated at relative pressures significantly below 1 bar. As a general approach, a concentration of approximately 100\u20131000 ppm for most gases is sufficient to determine the efficacy of a material against a toxic gas; however, these concentrations should be determined based on OSHA/NIOSH guidelines and the typical uses of each gas. Furthermore, for some applications regeneration of materials may prove useful. Most of the studies reviewed here do not discuss the regenerability of MOFs with respect to toxic chemicals, as is commonly seen in many CO", "2", " and H", "2", " studies; if a MOF can undergo many cycles of a specific adsorbate without a significant loss of capacity it may find additional uses beyond air filtration.", "Adsorption of ammonia can occur either through chemisorption at the CUSs, which in many cases destroys the MOF structure, or by hydrogen bonding, which can be facilitated by the functional groups on the organic linker. These removal mechanisms may also prove useful for analytes such as hydrogen sulfide, which exhibits similar chemisorption and hydrogen-bonding properties. Work in the IRMOF series has shown that \u2212NH", "2", " groups can facilitate hydrogen bonding, a property that should be studied for air purification in the more stable UiO-66 and MIL-53 MOF systems, by incorporating pendant functional groups. Furthermore, through computational methods functional groups such as \u2212COOH and \u2212OH have been shown to interact with ammonia strongly; however, incorporation of these functional groups as pendant groups on a MOF\u2019s surface has typically proven challenging due to their interactions with metal ions during self-assembly. Postsynthetic modification methods such as linker exchange may prove useful for incorporation of these groups into MOFs.", "Analytes such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, chlorine, iodine, and cyanogen chloride have proven much more difficult to remove from airstreams, as they do not chemisorb to CUSs, nor do they typically have strong physical interactions with functional groups on MOF linkers. Specific chemistries must be designed within the pore of the MOF to target each specific analyte. There is still much work to be done in this area, and most likely direct self-assembly of MOFs is not the answer for incorporation of these chemistries, as functional groups may interact with one another and the metal ions, upon attempted incorporation. However, postsynthetic modification of various types of MOFs to incorporate groups that can react with each analyte of interest may be desired. Also, incorporation of polyoxometalates or other nanoparticles in the pores of a MOF can prove useful for reacting these analytes; however, this typically creates the reduction of removal capacities for other analytes as pores and functional groups are blocked. Furthermore, approaches such as the creation of composites with other materials may prove useful for broad spectrum removal. MOFs provide the ability to have the removal chemistry completely bound to their inner surfaces, minimizing the probability of deleterious effects, which are typically seen in many broad spectrum removal carbons and other materials with impregnants.", "The incorporation of these chemistries into MOFs is important, but before MOFs can be widely used in filtration applications more work must be done in MOF particle engineering. Pressing pellets and extrusion work for some MOFs that can withstand high pressures without collapsing; however, many MOFs cannot withstand pressures high enough to form robust granules. These MOFs require the use of binders, which may cause pore blocking and ultimately a reduction in the amount of useable surface area for toxic chemical removal. Techniques should be investigated for the modification of MOFs to make them into engineered forms useful for direct implementation in filtration applications. Furthermore, more studies need to be done on these pellets to examine the effect that pressure and binders have on the chemical removal capacity. As these materials, and the methods for preparing them, become more commonplace, testing must be conducted simulating filter conditions to properly account for mass transfer limitations, as total capacity is only one part of the mechanism for toxic gas removal. Under dynamic conditions, a hierarchical pore structure has been shown to be useful for adsorption in carbonaceous and metal oxide/hydroxide materials. Incorporation of this type of pore structure in self-assembled materials proves challenging, but postsynthetic modification techniques, such as controlled etching, should be investigated to aid in mass transport.", "It is clear that much work has been done in maturing MOFs toward uses in toxic gas filtration in the past 10 years, and the number of studies in this area has been increasing at a rapid rate, as seen in Figure ", "31", "; however, most of the studies have been conducted with a few select MOFs. As more strategies are developed for the creation and modification of MOFs, these MOFs must be explored for their toxic gas removal capabilities. Very few laboratories in the world investigate toxic chemical removal by MOFs on a regular basis, and they cannot match the pace with which MOFs are being developed in the literature, or they do not have the synthetic capabilities of many of the groups creating these designer materials. The challenge of toxic gas filtration is not trivial, but synthetic materials and adsorption experts must collaborate to understand the full extent of possible uses of MOFs for air purification.", "Figure 31.

Chem. and biol. warfare agents constitute a low-probability, but high-impact risk both to the military and to the civilian population.  The use of hazardous materials of chem. or biol. origin as weapons and for homicide has been documented since ancient times.  The first use of chems. in terms of weapons of mass destruction goes back to World War I, when on Apr. 22, 1915 large amts. of chlorine were released by German military forces at Ypres, Belgium.  Until around the 1970s of the 20th century, the awareness of the threat by chem. and biol. agents had been mainly confined to the military sector.  In the following time, the development of increasing range delivery systems by chem. and biol. agents possessors sensitized public attention to the threat emanating from these agents.  Their proliferation to the terrorists field during the 1990s with the expanding scale and globalization of terrorist attacks suggested that these agents are becoming an increasing threat to the whole world community.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "19.

CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approx. atm. pressures.  Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore vols. of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, resp.  Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4.  Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites.  In addn., strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chem. bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement.

With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.

We argue that these materials present a unique chance of observing synergy between several of these properties, such as the coupling between photoluminescence and magnetism.  Moreover, an integrated approach towards the design of efficient, stable, cheap, environmentally-friendly and multifunctional luminescent LnMOFs is still missing.

The formation of well-defined MIL-100(Fe)/GO composites is not favored.  This is linked to the specific geometry of MIL-100(Fe).  The attachment of the GO C layers to the spherical cages of MIL-100(Fe) (via coordination between the O groups of GO and the metallic sites of the metal-org. framework) prevents the proper formation of the MIL-100(Fe) structure.

The sepn. selectivity and the working capacity of these structures were evaluated as important performance indicators for CO2 sepns. by PSA.  The results demonstrate a remarkable effect of coordinatively unsatd. sites on the selectivity and the working capacity.  Particularly, the high affinity of CPO-27-Ni and CPO-27-Co for CO2 leads to a low working capacity for CO2 (because regeneration of the adsorbents is difficult) but a high CO2/CH4 selectivity.  With a ternary CO/CO2/CH4 feed mixt., CPO-27-Ni and -Co prefer the adsorption of CO over CO2 due to the strong specific interaction of CO with cus.  Surprisingly, STA-12-Ni does not exhibit the same behavior: it is selective for the adsorption of CO2 in a ternary mixt., just like CPO-27-Zn.  Among the four MOFs tested in this study, CPO-27-Zn presents the best compromise between the working capacity and the CO2/CH4 and CO2/CO selectivities.

Pure gas isotherms of CH4, CO2 and H2S are realized at 303.15 K on powder and shape (pellet form) industrial MIL-53 (Al), with a gravimetric technique.  We also measure CO2/CH4 adsorption equil. at 303.15 K for two pressures (1 and 4 bar) on pellet form of the adsorbent.  These mixt. data are in good agreement with IAST predictions.  So we can compare the CH4/CO2 and CH4/H2S sepn. performances between powder and pellets.  Although the adsorption capacities are lower for pellets than for powder the sepn. qualities are similar.  After this test, we have concluded that the pellet form of MIL-53 (Al) is a good candidate for CO2 and H2S sepns. from CH4.  According to the selectivity values, the limiting sepn. of the process is the CO2/CH4 one.  So, we have performed exptl. and theor. the breakthrough curve with this binary mixt. and we have concluded that this sepn. is applicable.

At low pressures, a significant CO2/N2 selectivity increase is due to the increase of CO2 adsorption and decrease of N2 adsorption as a consequence of competition of adsorption sites between water and N2.

In modern anal. chem. researchers pursue novel materials to meet anal. challenges such as improvements in sensitivity, selectivity, and detection limit.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of microporous materials, and their unusual properties such as high surface area, good thermal stability, uniform structured nanoscale cavities, and the availability of in-pore functionality and outer-surface modification are attractive for diverse anal. applications.  This Account summarizes the research on the anal. applications of MOFs ranging from sampling to chromatog. sepn.  MOFs were either directly used or engineered to meet the demands of various anal. applications.  Bulk MOFs with microsized crystals are convenient sorbents for direct application to in-field sampling and solid-phase extn.  Quartz tubes packed with MOF-5 showed excellent stability, adsorption efficiency, and reproducibility for in-field sampling and trapping of atm. formaldehyde.  The 2-dimensional copper(II) isonicotinate packed microcolumn demonstrated large enhancement factors and good shape- and size-selectivity when applied to online solid-phase extn. of polycyclic arom. hydrocarbons in water samples.  The authors have explored the mol. sieving effect of MOFs for the efficient enrichment of peptides with simultaneous exclusion of proteins from biol. fluids.  These results show promise for the future of MOFs in peptidomics research.  Also, nanosized MOFs and engineered thin films of MOFs are promising materials as novel coatings for solid-phase microextn.  The authors have developed an in situ hydrothermal growth approach to fabricate thin films of MOF-199 on etched stainless steel wire for solid-phase microextn. of volatile benzene homologs with large enhancement factors and wide linearity.  Their high thermal stability and easy-to-engineer nanocrystals make MOFs attractive as new stationary phases to fabricate MOF-coated capillaries for high-resoln. gas chromatog. (GC).  The authors have explored a dynamic coating approach to fabricate a MOF-coated capillary for the GC sepn. of important raw chems. and persistent org. pollutants with high resoln. and excellent selectivity.  The authors have combined a MOF-coated fiber for solid-phase microextn. with a MOF-coated capillary for GC sepn., which provides an effective MOF-based tandem mol. sieve platform for selective microextn. and high-resoln. GC sepn. of target analytes in complex samples.  Microsized MOFs with good solvent stability are attractive stationary phases for HPLC.  These materials showed high resoln. and good selectivity and reproducibility in both the normal-phase HPLC sepn. of fullerenes and substituted aroms. on MIL-101 packed columns and position isomers on a MIL-53(Al) packed column and the reversed-phase HPLC sepn. of a wide range of analytes from nonpolar to polar and acidic to basic solutes.  Despite the above achievements, further exploration of MOFs in anal. chem. is needed.  Esp., anal. application-oriented engineering of MOFs is imperative for specific applications.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xjs1Cms7c%253D&md5=984eda154347b41ac68def1c53a9cf95", "174.

Probably trimerization of encapsulated formaldehyde takes place in a single reaction step with an activation energy of 34.5 kcal mol-1.  This is 17.2 kcal mol-1 higher than the corresponding activation energy in the bare system.  The reaction energy of the system studied herein is endothermic by 6.1 kcal mol-1 and the Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) of the reaction becomes pos. (11.0 kcal mol-1).  Consequently, the predicted reverse rate for the trimerization reaction in the Li-MOF-5 is significantly faster than the forward rate.

The mass-transfer mechanism for N2 can be explained by a surface barrier by using a linear driving force model, but that for O2 requires a combination of a surface barrier and micropore diffusion using a combined resistance model.  Alternatively, a distribution of surface barrier resistances is introduced to take into account heterogeneity of the surface and describes the exptl. data well.

The sensitivity of certain MOFs under humid conditions is well-known, but systematic studies of water adsorption properties of MOFs are lacking.  This information is crit. for developing design criteria for directing future synthesis efforts.  The goal of this work is to understand the influence of the extent of Zn-O bond shielding on the relative stabilities of MOFs belonging to the same family of isostructural, non-catenated pillared MOFs [Zn(L)(DABCO)0.5], where L is the functionalized BDC (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) linker.  The different extent of Zn-O bond shielding is provided by incorporating a broad range of functional groups on the BDC ligand.  The resulting MOFs have varying surface areas, pore sizes, and pore vols.  Stability is assessed through water vapor adsorption isotherms combined with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) expts. and surface area analyses.  Integration of polar functional groups (e.g., nitro, bromo, chloro, hydroxy, etc.) on the dicarboxylate linker renders these MOFs water unstable compared with the parent MOF as these polar functional groups have a neg. shielding effect; i.e., they facilitate hydrolysis of the Zn-O bond.  On the other hand, placing nonpolar groups (e.g., methyl) on the BDC ligand results in structurally robust MOFs because the Zn-O bond is effectively shielded from attack by water mols.  Therefore, the anthracene- and tetramethyl-BDC MOFs do not lose crystallinity or surface area after water exposure, in spite of the large amt. of water adsorption due to capillary condensation at \u223c20% relative humidity (RH).  This has been obsd. rarely in the MOF literature.  The results of this work show that by ligand functionalization it is possible to adjust the water stability of a pillared MOF in both the pos. and neg. directions and, thus, provide an important step toward understanding the water adsorption behavior of MOFs.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xhs1entr7J&md5=60a6277dba75e45e82bd5e631bb15dfa", "204.

The measurements were performed over the 50-120 K and 0-40 bar ranges, and modeled using micropore filling approaches.  The performances of a potential 100 L vessel filled with the densified MOF-177 are inferred from the modeling parameters.  A comparison of this technol. with the 70 MPa compressed gas hydrogen system shows under which conditions the adsorbent offer advantages in terms of volumetric and gravimetric capacities.  Further comparison with AX-21 activated carbon pellets reveals that densified MOF-177 stores about 40% more at 77 K and 35 bar.  In order to get a phys. sound modeling anal., we introduced an approach to establish effective satn. pressures for supercrit. adsorption.  This approach insures a consistency between key model parameters and the obsd. liq. properties of the adsorbed phase at the lowest temps.
