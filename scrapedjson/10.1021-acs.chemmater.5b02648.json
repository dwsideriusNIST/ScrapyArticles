Enantioselective formation of C-H, C-C, C-O and C-N bonds has been extensively studied using homogeneous asym. catalysts for many years.  However, these catalysts have yet to make a significant impact in the industrial synthesis of fine chems.  A central reason is that homogeneous asym. catalyst design requires relatively bulky ligands and catalyst re-use through recovery and recycle often causes problems.  One mechanism to overcome this problem is to immobilize the asym. catalyst onto a support and the resulting heterogeneous asym. catalyst can, in principle, be readily re-used.  This review covers the different methodologies for immobilization, including: adsorption, encapsulation, tethering using a covalent bond and electrostatic interaction.

Smart surfaces, surfaces that respond to an external stimulus in a defined manner, hold considerable potential as components in mol.-based devices, not least as discrete switching elements.  Many stimuli can be used to switch surfaces between different states, including redox, light, pH, and ion triggers.  The present review focuses on mol. switching through the electronic excitation of mols. on surfaces with light.  In developing light-responsive surfaces, investigators face several challenges, not only in achieving high photostationary states and fully reversible switching, but also in dealing with fatigue resistance and the effect of immobilization itself on mol. properties.  The immobilization of light-responsive mols. requires the design and synthesis of functional mol. components both to achieve light switching and to anchor the mol. entity onto a surface.

The implication of this concept for dynamic mols., whose performance has the disadvantages of random motion, is to bring them to a standstill in three-dimensional extended structures and thus significantly enhance their order, and ultimately their coherence and performance.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXmtlWlt7g%253D&md5=79cf0fcec448dd09b5fbfead8b5c0003", "20.

Flexible MOFs combine the cryst. order of the underlying coordination network with cooperative structural transformability.  These materials can respond to phys. and chem. stimuli of various kinds in a tunable fashion by mol. design, which does not exist for other known solid-state materials.  Among the fascinating properties are so-called breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host-guest interactions.  Phase transitions are triggered by guest adsorption/desorption, photochem., thermal, and mech. stimuli.  Other important flexible properties of MOFs, such as linker rotation and sub-net sliding, which are not necessarily accompanied by crystallog. phase transitions, are briefly mentioned as well.  Emphasis is given on reviewing the recent progress in application of in situ characterization techniques and the results of theor. approaches to characterize and understand the breathing mechanisms and phase transitions.  The flexible MOF systems, which are discussed, are categorized by the type of metal-nodes involved and how their coordination chem. with the linker mols. controls the framework dynamics.

Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.  Because we can functionalize the pores to direct their specific recognition of small mols., the emerging porous MOFs serve as novel functional materials for gas storage, sepn., heterogeneous catalysis, and sensing.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlslyhtrs%253D&md5=f9230905a5656f9fe0e487967ecae356", "25.

The biosynthesis of CoQ is studied in great detail in bacteria and yeast but only to a limited extent in animal tissues and therefore the informations available is restricted.

Quinones/hydroquinones (Q/HQ) are a class of prototypical redox mols. that play a variety of vital roles in biol., particularly in electron transfer and energy conservation systems.  Biointerfaces supported on solid substrates or nanomaterials are widely used as biomimetic platforms that connect biol. materials with artificial interfaces.  Q/HQ-functionalized biointerfaces provide a new means for understanding the complex behaviors of Q/HQ at the interfaces of biol. systems, and for further development of novel biomaterials and biosensors.  This tutorial review provides a brief introduction to the recent advances in this field.  We begin with the current methods used to functionalize Q/HQ on biointerfaces from the macro- to nano-scale (both solid substrates and nanomaterials), and then discuss their wide biol. applications.  Particularly exciting applications arise when Q/HQ-functionalized biointerface systems are coupled with biomimetic strategies.  These systems can be used as models of other functionalized biointerfaces for biol. applications, providing new insights into the future development of this area.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhvVGktLvF&md5=c68198179a470335f688086e6b753209", "42.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "44.

In this report, we describe the modular synthesis of novel dipyrazole ligands contg. naphthalenediimide cores functionalized with -H (H2NDI-H), -NHEt (H2NDI-NHEt), or -SEt (H2NDI-SEt) groups.

The Type V water adsorption isotherms measured for these materials show water uptake in the 40-50% relative humidity range, suggesting hydrophobic channel interiors.  Postsynthetic oxidn. of Zn(NDI-SEt) with dimethyldioxirane was used to generate Et sulfoxide and Et sulfone groups, thereby rendering the channels more hydrophilic, as evidenced by shifts in water uptake to the 30-40% relative humidity range.

The fabrication of thin film coatings of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) on various substrates is discussed in this crit. review.  Interestingly, the relatively few studies on MOF films that have appeared in the literature are limited to the following cases: [Zn4O(bdc)3] (MOF-5; bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), [Cu3(btc)2] (HKUST-1; btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] (dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), [Mn(HCOO)], [Cu2(pzdc)2(pyz)] (CPL-1; pzdc = pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate, pyz = pyrazine), [Fe(OH)(bdc)] (MIL-53(Fe)) and [Fe3O(bdc)3(Ac)] (MIL-88B; Ac = CH3COO-).  Various substrates and support materials have been used, including silica, porous alumina, graphite and org. surfaces, i.e. self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold, as well as silica surfaces.  Most of the MOF films were grown by immersion of the selected substrates into specifically pre-treated solvothermal mother liquors of the particular MOF material.  This results in more or less densely packed films of intergrown primary crystallites of sizes ranging up to several \u03bcm, leading to corresponding film thicknesses.  Alternatively, almost atomically flat and very homogeneous films, with thicknesses of up to ca. 100 nm, were grown in a novel stepwise layer-by-layer method.  The individual growth steps are sepd. by removing unreacted components via rinsing the substrate with the solvent.  The layer-by-layer method offers the possibility to study the kinetics of film formation in more detail using surface plasmon resonance.  In some cases, particularly on SAM-modified substrates, a highly oriented growth was obsd., and in the case of the MIL-53/MIL-88B system, a phase selective deposition of MIL-88B, rather than MIL-53(Fe), was reported.  The growth of MOF thin films is important for smart membranes, catalytic coatings, chem. sensors and related nanodevices (63 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXkvVamu7g%253D&md5=59eb12bf16cf57126492a7e6b38baf9a", "53.
