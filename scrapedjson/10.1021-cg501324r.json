NMR, IR spectra, powder XRD, TEM, and mass spectra suggested that a terephthalate linker in UiO-66 was substituted by two alkanedioate moieties, resulting in free carboxyl pendants in the pores.  When post-synthetically modified UiO-66 was partially digested by adjusting the amt. of added HF per sample, NMR spectra indicated that the ratio of alkanedioic acid/terephthalic acid was increased with smaller amts. of acid, implying that the ligand substitution proceeded from the outer layer of the particles.  Gas sorption studies indicated that the surface areas and the pore vols. of all UiO-66-ADns were decreased compared to those of UiO-66, and that the CO2 adsorption capacities of UiO-66-ADn (n = 4, 8) were similar to that of UiO-66.  In the case of UiO-66-AD6, the CO2 uptake capacity was 34% higher at 298 K and 58% higher at 323 K compared to those of UiO-66.  It was elucidated by thermodn. calcns. that the introduction of flexible carboxyl pendants of appropriate length has two effects: (1) it increases the interaction enthalpy between the host framework and CO2 mols., and (2) it mitigates the entropy loss upon CO2 adsorption due to the formation of multiple configurations for the interactions between carboxyl groups and CO2 mols.  The ideal adsorption soln. theory (IAST) selectivity for CO2 adsorption over that of CH4 was enhanced for all of the UiO-66-ADns compared to that of UiO-66 at 298 K.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) -highly cryst. hybrid materials that combine metal ions with rigid org. ligands- have emerged as an important class of porous materials.  The org. ligands add flexibility and diversity to the chem. structures and functions of these materials.  In this Account, we summarize our lab.'s experience in tuning the topol. and functionality of MOFs by ligand design.  These investigations have led to new materials with interesting properties.  By using a ligand that can adopt different symmetry conformations through free internal bond rotation, we have obtained two MOFs that are supramol. stereoisomers of each other at different reaction temps.  In another case, where the dimerized ligands function as a D3-Piedfort unit spacer, we achieve chiral (10,3)-a networks.  In the design of MOF-based materials for hydrogen and methane storage, we focused on increasing the gas affinity of frameworks by using ligands with different geometries to control the pore size and effectively introduce unsatd. metal centers (UMCs) into the framework.  Framework interpenetration in PCN-6 (PCN stands for porous coordination network) can lead to higher hydrogen uptake.  Because of the proper alignment of the UMCs, PCN-12 holds the record for uptake of hydrogen at 77 K/760 Torr.  In the case of methane storage, PCN-14 with anthracene-derived ligand achieves breakthrough storage capacity, at a level 28% higher than the U.S. Department of Energy target.  Selective gas adsorption requires a pore size comparable to that of the target gas mols.; therefore, we use bulky ligands and network interpenetration to reduce the pore size.  In addn., with the help of an amphiphilic ligand, we were able to use temp. to continuously change pore size in a 2D layer MOF.  Adding charge to an org. ligand can also stabilize frameworks.  By ionizing the amine group within mesoMOF-1, the resulting electronic repulsion keeps the network from collapsing, giving rise to the first case of mesoporous MOF that demonstrates the type IV isotherm.  We use dendritic hexacarboxylate ligands to synthesize an isoreticular series of MOFs with (3,24)-connected network topol.  The cuboctahedral cages serve as building blocks that narrow the opening of the mesocavities into microwindows and stabilize these MOFs.  The resulting materials have exceptionally high surface areas and hydrogen uptake capacities.  Despite the many achievements in MOF development, there is still ample opportunity for further exploration.  We will be continuing our efforts and look forward to contributing to this blossoming field in the next decade.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhsV2ksbfO&md5=f17f81d99259e7ee659b30bcc2ddeea2", "26.

A metal-org. framework (MOF), chromium(III) terephthalate (MIL-101), possesses several unprecedented features such as a mesoporous zeotype architecture with mesoporous cages and microporous windows, a giant cell vol., huge surface area, and numerous unsatd. chromium sites.  The presence of unsatd. Cr(III) sites in MIL-101 provides an intrinsic chelating property with electron-rich functional groups.  This feature offers a powerful way to selectively functionalize the unsatd. sites in the MOFs, differing in many respects from the functionalization of mesoporous silica and other porous hybrids reported so far.  This work demonstrates that the surface amine-grafting undoubtedly provides a general way of selective functionalization of porous MOFs besides that with unsatd. metal sites.  The present approach indeed ensures the development of functionalized MOFs for the immobilization and encapsulation of org. mols. and metal components that are useful for catalysis, adsorption, mol. recognition, and so on.  Here some of the recent ideas concerning site-selective functionalization of MIL-101 are examd. and explained, focusing on the utilization of unsatd. Cr(III) sites.

(HKUST-1, PCN-11, and PCN-14) the CH4 storage capacities of which are among the highest reported so far among all porous materials.  The three MOFs consist of the same dicopper paddle-wheel secondary building units, but contain different org. linkers, leading to cagelike pores with various sizes and geometries.  From neutron powder diffraction expts. and accurate data anal., assisted by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and DFT calcns., we unambiguously revealed the exact locations of the stored methane mols. in these MOF materials.  We found that methane uptake takes place primarily at two types of strong adsorption site: (1) the open Cu coordination sites, which exhibit enhanced Coulomb attraction toward methane, and (2) the van der Waals potential pocket sites, in which the total dispersive interactions are enhanced due to the mol. being in contact with multiple \"surfaces.\".  Interestingly, the enhanced van der Waals sites are present exclusively in small cages and at the windows to these cages, whereas large cages with relatively flat pore surfaces bind very little methane.  Our results suggest that further, rational development of new MOF compds. for methane storage applications should focus on enriching open metal sites, increasing the vol. percentage of accessible small cages and channels, and minimizing the fraction of large pores.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXltlWgtb0%253D&md5=8f6059d2e137ca23fb5eeb17d127be74", "39.

The authors report an example of interpenetration that is simply controlled by the presence of a carbon-carbon double or single bond in identical org. building blocks, and provide a comparison of gas-sorption properties for these similar frameworks, which differ only in their degree of interpenetration.

In general, non-interpenetrated SNU-70' exhibits much higher gas-adsorption capacities than interpenetrated SNU-71' at high pressures, regardless of the temp.  However, at P < 1 atm, the gas adsorption capacities for N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 195 K are higher for non-interpenetrated SNU-70' than for interpenetrated SNU-71', but the capacities for H2 and CH4 are the opposite; SNU-71' has higher uptake capacities than SNU-70' due to the higher isosteric heat of gas adsorption that results from the smaller pores.  In particular, SNU-70' has exceptionally high H2 and CO2 uptake capacities.
