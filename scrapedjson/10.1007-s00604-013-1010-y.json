Most of these pollutants are very toxic and dangerous for human health. Thus determination of trace amounts of heavy metals is often a major task for the analytical chemists, as it is a good tool for the identification and monitoring of toxicants in environmental samples. Among heavy metals that exist in the environment, cadmium monitoring is very vital due to the fact that cadmium concentrations in the environment are increasing dramatically [", "1", ", ", "2", "]. Cadmium exposure can be linked to diseases associated with aging such as osteoporosis, prostate, and pancreatic cancer [", "3", ", ", "4", "]. Lead is one of the most toxic and hazardous elements in human health, because it can cause detrimental effect on metabolic processes of human beings [", "5", "]. It has been proven to be a carcinogenic agent. One of the heavy metals is nickel which is toxic. Aspiration of its derivatives can lead to serious problems, including nasopharynx, lung and dermatological diseases and malignant tumors [", "6", "]. Moreover, nickel can cause skin disorder, known as nickel-eczema which is a considerable health problem exclusively among women [", "7", "]. Zinc deficiency might lead to several disorders such as growth retardation, diarrhea, immunity depression, eye and skin lesions, malfunction of wound healing, and other skin diseases [", "8", "]. Though trace amounts of metals such as zinc are biotic for humans, the excess utilization can be harmful and toxic, so it should be used in the case of physiological needs. Thus the determination of trace amounts of heavy metals is one of the most important topics in analytical chemistry.", "Various instrumental techniques, including electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) [", "9", ", ", "10", "], inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) [", "11", "], flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) [", "12", "], inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) [", "13", "], and total reflection XRF-spectrometry [", "14", "] have been used for the determination of heavy metals. Since the heavy metals concentration level in environmental samples is fairly low and the complexity of matrices is a main problem; thus preconcentration techniques are often required [", "15", "]. Different procedures such as: liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) [", "16", "], cloud point extraction [", "17", "], chemical precipitation [", "18", "], ion exchange [", "19", "], and solid phase extraction (SPE) have been developed for the extraction and preconcentration of heavy metals in natural matrices [", "20", ", ", "21", ", ", "22", "].", "Among mentioned methods, the most commonly used technique for the preconcentration of heavy metal ions from environmental samples is solid phase extraction. Its common application is due to its simplicity, rapidity, minimal cost, and low consumption of reagents [", "23", "]. By the advent of SPE, various diverse sorbents have been utilized such as carbon nanotubes [", "24", ", ", "25", ", ", "26", "], magnetic nanoparticles [", "27", "], solid sulfur [", "28", "], Cotton [", "29", "], and modified porous materials [", "30", "]. Porous materials are defined as solids containing empty voids which can host other molecules. The fundamental features of these materials are their porosity, the ratio between total occupied and empty space, the (average) size of the pores and the surface area. Typical surface area values for the porous materials applied in technological processes range between 2,000 and 8,000\u00a0m", "2", "\u00a0g", "\u22121", "[", "31", "]. The most important applications of such materials are the storage of small molecules and filtering .The metal organic frameworks are defined as a nanocomposite material which can be consisted of either inorganic or organic materials. MOFs have shown high potential in gas storage, separation, chemical sensing, drug delivery, and heterogeneous catalysis applications [", "32", "]. In general, the flexible and highly porous structure of MOFs allows guest species such as metal ions to diffuse into their bulk structure. The shape and size of the pores lead to selectivity over the guests that may be adsorbed. These features make MOFs an ideal sorbent in solid phase extraction of heavy metals. However, there is little information about MOFs as an adsorbent [", "33", "].", "In this work for the first time a magnetic metal organic framework immobilized with Fe", "3", "O", "4", "\u2013Dithizone has been utilized as a novel adsorbent for the fast separation and the preconcentration of Cd(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) ions in various matrixes. The magnetic sorbent was characterized by, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry (TG), and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The magnetic property of the sorbent causes a rapid and easy separation of the new solid phase from the solution. The presence of dithizone in the sorbent helps the new solid phase to show selectivity towards these heavy metals. Also MOF cavities can increase the surface area and adsorption capacity of this new sorbent. A Box\u2013Behnken design was used in order to find the optimum conditions of the method through response surface methodology.

In these conditions, a response surface design could be done without previously performing a screening design. The BBD was chosen because it requires the least number of experiments (15 run). The data obtained were evaluated by ANOVA. The results of the experimental design were evaluated at 5\u00a0% of significance and analyzed by standardized Pareto chart (Fig. S", "2", ", supporting information). Based on BBD, volume and concentration of the eluent showed positive and significant effects on the recovery of the heavy metal ions while elution time has a positive but non-significant effect.

The RSM (Fig. S", "2", ", supporting information) was applied to analyze simultaneous effects of the eluent concentration and eluent volume variables on the responses. The extraction efficiency of heavy metal ions increased along with the increase in the eluent concentration and its volume. According to the overall results of the optimization study, the following experimental conditions were chosen: eluent volume, 7.8\u00a0mL; elution time, 19\u00a0min; and concentration of eluent, 0.9\u00a0mol\u00a0L", "\u2212l", " thiourea in 0.01\u00a0mol\u00a0L", "\u22121", " NaOH solution.", "Effect of breakthrough volume", "In the analysis of real samples, the sample volume is one of the important parameters affecting the preconcentration factor.

Other advantages of this method are: (1) low time-consumption due to the magnetically-assisted separation of the adsorbent and higher surface area; therefore, satisfactory results can be achieved by using fewer amounts of the adsorbents. Due to the relatively high preconcentration factor, trace amounts of heavy metal at ng mL", "\u22121", " levels in high-volume samples can be quantified by the magnetic nanocomposite."], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO1\"> <div class=\"Caption\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"CaptionContent\"><span class=\"CaptionNumber\">Figure</span> <p class=\"SimplePara\">A schematic diagram for synthesis of magnetic MOF-DHz nanocomposite.</p> </div></div> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Figa_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Figa_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO2\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Fig1_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Fig1_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO3\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Fig2_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Fig2_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO4\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Fig3_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Fig3_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO5\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Fig4_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00604-013-1010-y/MediaObjects/604_2013_1010_Fig4_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>"]}
