Unlike most other MOFs that have been studied for H storage, it has an ionic framework and many small channels.  The simulations demonstrate that it is both of these phys. characteristics that lead to strong H interactions in the MOF and ultimately large H uptake.  Microscopically, H interacts with the MOF via 3 principle attractive potential energy contributions: Van der Waals, charge-quadrupole and induction.  Previous simulations of H storage in MOFs and other materials have not focused on the role of polarization effects, but they are demonstrated here to be the dominant contribution to H physisorption.  Indeed, polarization interactions in the MOF lead to 2 distinct populations of dipolar H that are identified from the simulations and that should be evident in Raman spectra.

The MOF is a decorated/substituted isostructural analog to the unembellished rht-MOF, PCN-61, that was studied previously.  The simulations were performed using three different hydrogen potentials of increasing complexity.  Simulated hydrogen sorption isotherms and calcd. isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, values were in excellent agreement with the reported exptl. data for only a polarizable model in one of four exptl. obsd. crystal structure configurations.  The study demonstrates the ability of modeling to distinguish the differential sorption of distinct structures; one configuration is found to be dominant due to favorable interactions with substrates.  In addn., the presence of polar amide groups had a significant effect on the electrostatics of the Cu2+ ions and directs the low-pressure physisorption of hydrogen in the MOF.  This is in contrast to what was obsd. in PCN-61, where an exterior copper ion had a higher relative charge and was the favored loading site.  This tunability of the electrostatics of the copper ions via chem. substitution on the MOF framework can be explained by the presence of the neg. charged oxygen atom of the amide group that causes the interior Cu2+ ion to exhibit a higher pos. charge through an inductive effect.  Further, control simulations, taking advantage of the flexibility afforded by theor. modeling, include artificially modified charges for both Cu2+ ions chosen equal to or with a higher charge on the exterior Cu2+ ion.  This choice resulted in distinctly different hydrogen sorption characteristics in Cu-TPBTM with no direct sorption on the open-metal sites.  Thus, this study demonstrates both the tunable nature of MOF platforms and the possibility for rational design of sorption/catalytic sites and characteristics through the active interplay of theory and expt.

Notable differences were obsd. in the partial charge and polarizability of the metal ions derived from the electronic structure calcns.  The modeling parameters obtained from the electronic structure calcns. were found to influence certain features in the exptl. obsd. H2 sorption trends in the M-MOF-74 series.  The simulations were performed with the inclusion of explicit many-body polarization, which was required to reproduce the exptl. H2 sorption observables (i.e., sorption isotherms and isosteric heats of adsorption (Qst)) and the H2-metal interaction in all 4 MOFs using classical mol. simulation.  Consistent with exptl. measurements, the simulations captured the following trend for the H2-metal interaction strength: Ni-MOF-74 > Co-MOF-74 > Mg-MOF-74 > Zn-MOF-74.  The calcns. revealed that stronger H2-metal interactions within the M-MOF-74 series corresponded to shorter H2-metal distances and higher induced dipoles on the metal-sorbed H2 mols.  There was a strong correlation between the H2-metal interaction and the polarization contribution.  Although Mg-MOF-74 has the highest calcd. partial charge for the metal ion within the series, the Mg2+ ion has a very low polarizability compared to the other M2+ ions; this explains why the H2-metal interaction in this MOF is weaker compared to those for Ni-MOF-74 and Co-MOF-74.  The sterics interactions, reflected in the crystal structure for all 4 MOFs, also played a role for the obsd. H2 sorption trends.  Zn-MOF-74 has the lowest H2 uptakes and Qst within the series due to an unfavorable geometric environment for the Zn2+ ions within the ZnO5 clusters.  Lastly, the 2-dimensional quantum rotational levels were calcd. for the H2-metal interaction in all 4 MOFs using the potential energy function employed herein and the calcd. transitions were in good agreement with the corresponding peaks that were obsd. in the exptl. inelastic n scattering (INS) spectra for the resp.

The rht-MOF possesses a cationic framework and charge-balancing extraframework NO3- ions.  Three types of unique open cages exist in the framework: rhombicuboctahedral, tetrahedral, and cuboctahedral cages.  The NO3- ions exhibit small mobility and are located at the windows connecting the tetrahedral and cuboctahedral cages.  At low pressures, H2 adsorption occurs near the NO3- ions that act as preferential sites.

This enables the extn. of the Coulomb energy, forces, and stresses from a spherically truncated, usually charged environment in a manner that is independent of the grouping of the pair terms.  The close connection of our approach with the Ewald method is demonstrated and exploited, providing an efficient method for the simulation of even highly disordered ionic systems by direct, pairwise r-1 summation with spherical truncation at rather short range, i.e., a method which fully exploits the short-ranged nature of the interactions in ionic systems.

Nonetheless, the INS spectra of the rotational transitions of H2, HD, and D2 clearly show that phys. adsorption occurs on several different sites.  Both the CaNaA and CaA samples have strong rotational bands near 6 meV.  On this basis, the authors conclude that the principal adsorption site in CaNaA is in the vicinity of the Ca2+ cation where H2 experiences a rotational barrier of \u223c 4.3 kJ/mol.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28Xjt1Wns7c%253D&md5=423d6d5c3e70c87a99b97c0d48224a67", "87.

Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies reveal that the initial sites occupied by adsorbed H2 are the open Cu centers of the paddlewheel units with comparable interaction energies in the two isomers.  At high H2 loadings, where the H2 mols. adsorb mainly on or around the org. linkers, the interaction is substantially stronger in catenated PCN-6 than in noncatenated PCN-6', leading to much higher H2 uptake in the isomer with catenation.  Hydrogen sorption measurements at pressures up to 50 bar demonstrate that framework catenation can be favorable for the enhancement of hydrogen adsorption.  For example, the excess hydrogen uptake of PCN-6 is 72 mg/g (6.7%) at 77 K/50 bar or 9.3 mg/g (0.92%) at 298 K/50 bar, resp., and that for PCN-6' is 42 mg/g (4.0%) at 77 K/50 bar or 4.0 mg/g (0.40%) at 298 K/50 bar.  Importantly, PCN-6 exhibits a total hydrogen uptake of 95 mg/g (8.7%) (corresponding to a total volumetric value of 53.0 g/L, estd. based on crystallog. d.) at 77 K/50 bar and 15 mg/g (1.5%) at 298 K/50 bar.

A five-site (van der Waals and point charge) anisotropic model, that includes many-body polarization, is proposed.  It is parametrized to reproduce high-level electronic structure calcns. (CCSD-(T) using Dunning-type basis sets extrapolated to the CBS limit) for a representative set of dimer potential energy curves.  Thus it provides a relatively simple yet robust and broadly applicable representation of nitrogen.  Two versions are developed, differing by the type of mixing rules applied to unlike Lennard-Jones potential sites.  It is shown that the Waldman-Hagler mixing rules are more accurate than Lorentz-Berthelot.  The resulting potentials are demonstrated to be effective in modeling neat nitrogen but are designed to also be useful in modeling N2 interactions in a large array of environments such as metal-org. frameworks and zeolites and at interfaces.  In such settings, capturing anisotropic forces and interactions with (open and coordinated) metals and charged/polar environments is essential.  In developing the potential, it was found that adding a seemingly redundant dimer orientation, slip-parallel (S), improved the transferability of the potential energy surface (PES).  Notably, one of the solid phases of nitrogen was not as accurately represented energetically without including S in the representative set.  Liq. simulations, however, were unaffected and worked equally well for both potentials.  This suggests that accounting for a wide variety of configurations is crit. in designing a potential that is intended for use in heterogeneous environments where many orientations, including those not commonly explored in the bulk, are possible.  Testing and validation of the potential are achieved via simulations of a thermal distribution of trimer geometries compared to analogous high level electronic structure calcns. and mol. simulations of bulk pressure-d. isotherms across the vapor, supercrit., and liq. phases.  Crystal lattice parameters and energetics of the \u03b1-N2 and \u03b3-N2 solid phases are also evaluated and detd. to be in good agreement with expt.  Thus the proposed potential is shown to be efficacious for gas, liq., and solid use, representing both disordered and ordered configurations.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhslymsL%252FE&md5=6e49a20dae42fba851544c350847cf0b"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2015/cgdefu.2015.15.issue-3/cg5018104/20150227/images/small/cg-2014-018104_0012.gif\">"]}
