However, it is found that adsorption on the basal plane sites is exothermic and stable, in contrast to previous semi-empirical results.  On the edge sites, the C-H bond energy decreases by nearly 30 kcal/mol when two H atoms are adsorbed on the same site.  On the basal plane, the C-H bond energy decreases from 46 kcal/mol when two H are adsorbed on alternating sites to 27 kcal/mol when they are adsorbed on two adjacent sites.  Literature MO results of H adsorption on the exterior wall of SWNT are in fair agreement with that on the basal plane of graphite.  The value 27 kcal/mol agrees well with expt. (23 kcal/mol) of TPD of hydrogen from MWNT.

The applicability of the LF isotherm to MIPs was demonstrated using five representative MIPs from the literature, including both homogeneous and heterogeneous MIPs.

Presented is a review of methods that take into account binding site heterogeneity when calcg. the binding properties of MIPs.

These methods yield a measure of heterogeneity in the form of binding site affinity distributions and the heterogeneity index.  Recent developments have made these methods surprisingly easy to use while also yielding more accurate measures of the binding properties of MIPs.  These have allowed for easier comparison and optimization of MIPs.  Heterogeneous binding models have also led to a better understanding of the imprinting process and of the advantages and limitations of MIPs in chromatog. and sensor applications.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2cXjtVOjtrc%253D&md5=a2429a1dd9fd912ac7c4a6a9552c1a59", " ", "25.

The advantage of the FI is that it is a heterogeneous binding model that can accommodate and measure the heterogeneity inherent in MIPs.  However, it is often difficult to verify whether the FI is an appropriate binding model for a particular MIP because only a narrow portion of the binding isotherm is exptl. measurable.  This study takes a crit. examn. of whether the FI is an appropriate binding model for MIPs and explores its limitations in characterizing a (+)-cinchonine (CN) imprinted polymer and a non-imprinted polymer (NIP), a methacrylic acid - ethylene glycol dimethacrylate copolymer prepd. in the presence of the imprinting mol. by radical polymn. with AIBN initiator.  A wider portion of the binding isotherm can be examd. by systematically measuring a series of isotherms at different polymer concns.  This strategy verified that FI can yield an accurate measure of the heterogeneity in the cinchonine MIP and the NIP.  However, in cases of extremely high polymer loading, satn. was obsd., and the FI yielded inaccurate measurement of the binding properties even though the exptl. isotherm appears to be well modeled by the FI.  Further, these studies indicate that the FI accurately predicts the heterogeneity index for more homogeneous compared to heterogeneous polymers over a wider concn. range but is subject to considerable error as satn. conditions are approached.  These studies demonstrate the importance of correctly applying the FI to the lowest concn. portion of the binding isotherm that is exptl. measurable.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXkslyjsQ%253D%253D&md5=721469e741f1a588e5f662b60798b32a", " ", " "], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2010/jpccck.2010.114.issue-32/jp104014f/production/images/small/jp-2010-04014f_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2010/jpccck.2010.114.issue-32/jp104014f/production/images/small/jp-2010-04014f_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2010/jpccck.2010.114.issue-32/jp104014f/production/images/small/jp-2010-04014f_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2010/jpccck.2010.114.issue-32/jp104014f/production/images/small/jp-2010-04014f_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2010/jpccck.2010.114.issue-32/jp104014f/production/images/small/jp-2010-04014f_0005.gif\">"]}
