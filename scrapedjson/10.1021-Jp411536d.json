The first exothermic process occurs between 200 and 400 \u00b0C, including two weak peaks at 230 and 330 \u00b0C, respectively.

Combining the TG\u2013MS and TG\u2013DSC results of the AlBDC", "Syn", " sample, it can be concluded that the volatization, pyrolysis, and combustion of the free guest molecules and some occluded BDC ligands should take place simutaneously below 400 \u00b0C under air, which also decreases the heat release to some extant.

Both CO2 and CH4 adsorption capacities are significantly higher than those of zeolite 13X under similar conditions.  The pressure-dependent equil. selectivity of CO2 over CH4 (q CO2/q CH4) in the Mg-MOF-74 adsorbent showed a trend similar to that of zeolite 13X and the intrinsic selectivity of Mg-MOF-74 at zero adsorption loading is 283 at 298 K The initial heats of adsorption of CO2 and CH4 on the Mg-MOF-74 adsorbent are 73.0 and 18.5 kJ mol-1, resp.  The adsorption kinetic measurements suggest that the diffusivities of CO2 and CH4 on Mg-MOF-74 were comparable to those on zeolite 13X.  CH4 showed relatively faster adsorption kinetics than CO2 in both adsorbents.  The diffusion time consts. of CO2 and CH4 in the Mg-MOF-74 adsorbent at 298 K are 8.11 \u00d7 10-3 and 4.05 \u00d7 10-2 s-1, resp., showing a modest kinetic selectivity of \u223c5 for the sepn.

This article provides an overview of conventional and developing gas processing technologies for CO2 and N2 removal from natural gas.  We consider process technologies based on absorption, distn., adsorption, membrane sepn. and hydrates.  For each technol., we describe the fundamental sepn. mechanisms involved and the commonly applied process flow schemes designed to produce pipeline quality gas (typically 2% CO2, <3% N2) and gas to feed a cryogenic gas plant (typically 50 ppmv CO2, 1% N2).  Amine absorption technologies for CO2 and H2S removal (acid gas treating) are well-established in the natural gas industry.  The advantages and disadvantages of the conventional amine- and phys.-solvent-based processes for acid gas treating are discussed.  The use of CO2 selective membrane technologies for bulk sepn. of CO2 is increasing in the natural gas industry.  Novel low-temp. CO2 removal technologies such as ExxonMobil's Controlled Freeze Zone\u00ae process and rapid cycle pressure swing adsorption processes are also emerging as alternatives to amine scrubbers in certain applications such as for processing high CO2 concn. gases and for developing remote gas fields.  Cryogenic distn. remains the leading N2 rejection technol. for large scale (feed rates greater than 15 MMscfd) natural gas and liquefied natural gas plants.  However, technologies based on CH4 selective absorption and adsorption, as well as N2 selective pressure swing adsorption technologies, are com. available for smaller scale gas processing facilities.  The review discusses the scope for the development of better performing CO2 selective membranes, N2 selective solvents and N2 selective adsorbents to both improve sepn. power and the durability of the materials used in novel gas processing technologies.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhtlGrurzL&md5=2c6af582e2f0cf2adaaa5992facdbe36", "4.

Performance and cost models of an amine (MEA)-based CO2 absorption system for post-combustion flue gas applications were developed and integrated with an existing power plant model framework which includes multi-pollutant control technologies for other regulated emissions.  This integrated model was used to study the feasibility and cost of C capture and sequestration at new and existing coal-burning power plants.  The cost of C avoidance depends strongly on assumptions about the ref. plant design, details of the CO2 capture system design, interactions with other pollution control systems, and method of CO2 storage.  CO2 avoidance cost for retrofit systems was generally higher than for new plants, mainly due to the higher energy penalty resulting from less efficient heat integration and site-specific difficulties typically encountered in retrofit applications.  For all cases, a small redn. in CO2 capture cost was afforded by the SO2 emission trading credits generated by amine-based capture systems.

Formation of this material indicates that under reflux in water a partial hydrolysis of the MOF network occurs producing H2BDC mols. (occluded in the pores) and \u03b3-AlO(OH) species.  The latter is shown to form a thick shell (100-200 nm) consisting of strongly crumpled sheets of 3 nm of thickness.  Formation of \u03b3-AlO(OH) under reflux in water allows one to use such treatment as an easy way to modify the surface properties of MIL-53(Al).  Treatment of MIL-53(Al) under reflux in water for a short time (<1 h) yields a thin layer of \u03b3-AlO(OH) on the surface of the particles while only slightly decreasing their pore vol. (from 0.57 to 0.50 cm3/g).  Such surface modification of MIL-53(Al) might be useful from two points of view.  First, it creates a strongly hydrophilic layer on the surface of material and may thus facilitate its shaping.  Second, the OH groups of \u03b3-AlO(OH) surface layer may be used as anchoring sites for functionalization of MIL-53(Al) particles.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhs1yhs7rE&md5=69ab6ff2982c7421ece9e89e68aa2032", "40.

Its 3 D framework is built up of infinite trans chains of corner-sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra.  The chains are interconnected by the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate groups, creating 1 D rhombic-shaped tunnels.  Disordered 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid mols. are trapped inside these tunnels.  Their evacuation upon heating, between 275 and 420\u00b0, leads to a nanoporous open-framework (MIL-53ht (Al) or Al(OH)[O2CC6H4CO2]) with empty pores of diam. 8.5 \u00c5.  This solid exhibits a Langmuir surface area. of 1590(1) m2g-1 together with a remarkable thermal stability, since it starts to decomp. only at 500\u00b0.  At room temp., the solid reversibly absorbs H2O in its tunnels, causing a very large breathing effect and shrinkage of the pores.  Anal. of the hydration process by solid-state NMR (1H, 13C, 27Al) has clearly indicated that the trapped H2O mols. interact with the carboxylate groups through H bonds, but do not affect the hydroxyl species bridging the Al atoms.

Modern methods for the characterization of porous materials are probably as numerous and divers as applications of porous solids.  In recent years interest has grown in a deeper understanding of surface phenomena beyond the usual description of surface area and adsorption isotherm.  This has lead to an introduction of more sophisticated approaches, which allow for a study of thermodn. and kinetic information.  One technique, which has been shown to be very valuable is inverse gas chromatog. (IGC).  Due to its increasing application in industry it is the intention of this short review to introduce the principals as well as the more common applications of IGC.  The methods and parameters to be discussed include isotherm detn., the measurement of surface and free energy as well as the calcn. of acid-base parameters.
