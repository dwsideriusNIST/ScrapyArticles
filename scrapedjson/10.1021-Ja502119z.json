A series of recent reports has shown that materials such as poly(aryleneethynylene)s (PAEs), poly(phenylene butadiynylene)s, poly(phenylene vinylene), poly(p-phenylene)s, polysilanes, polyanilines, and polytriazines can be produced as microporous networks with apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas of more than 1000 m2 g-1 in some cases.  Micropore size and surface area can be synthetically fine-tuned in amorphous PAE polymers and copolymers, something which was previously thought to be the preserve of ordered cryst. materials such as metal org. frameworks.

The recent progress in adsorption-based CO2 capture by MOFs is reviewed and summarized in this crit. review.  CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approx. atm. pressures.  Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore vols. of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, resp.  Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4.  Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites.  In addn., strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chem. bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement.  Besides the advantages, two main challenges of using MOFs in CO2 capture, the cost of synthesis and the stability toward water vapor, have been analyzed and possible solns. and path forward have been proposed to address the two challenges as well (150 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XivFWlsbo%253D&md5=0ff1149f94a6e21a49a6591786eac483", "(b) ", "Nugent", ", ", "P.", "; ", "Belmabkhout", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Burd", ", ", "S.

Commensurate adsorption is an interesting and important phenomenon occurring during adsorption processes, where the mol. size and shape of the adsorbate (guest mol.) lead to an orientation and adsorbed amt.

As a new type of adsorbate material with distinctly advantageous features, microporous metal org. frameworks (MMOFs) demonstrate enormous potential for adsorption based applications, including storage, sepn., and purifn. of small gases and hydrocarbons.  Commensurate adsorption of hydrocarbons occurs far more often in MMOFs than in zeolites and related materials, primarily as a result of a vastly greater variety of framework types and richer hierarchy of complexity of the pore structures for the former.

The efficacy of nanoporous cryst. materials in sepn. applications is often influenced to a significant extent by diffusion of guest mols. within the pores of the structural frameworks.  The Maxwell-Stefan (M-S) equations provide a fundamental and convenient description of mixt. diffusion.  The M-S formulation highlights two sep. factors that cause mixt. diffusion to be intrinsically coupled: correlation effects, and thermodn. coupling.  By careful and detailed analyses of a variety of published exptl. data on (a) mixt. permeation across nanoporous membranes, (b) transient uptake of mixts. within crystals, and (c) transient breakthrough characteristics of fixed bed adsorbers, we identify conditions that require the use of M-S equations including both correlation effects and thermodn. coupling.  Situations are also identified in which either of the coupling effects can be ignored.  Correlation effects cause slowing-down of more-mobile-less-strongly-adsorbed mols. by tardier-more-strongly-adsorbed-partner species; such slowing-down effects are often essential for modeling mixt. permeation across nanoporous membranes.  Overshoots in the transient uptake of the more mobile partners in single crystals are essentially the consequence of thermodn. coupling, originating from sizable off-diagonal elements of thermodn. correction factors \u0393ij.

Ethylene resides along the channel wall with the \u03c3h plane facing the channel wall, while ethane resides randomly in the channels of Ib and IIb.  These results suggest that the olefin sorption is enhanced by electrostatic interaction between the \u03c0-electron of olefins and highly polarized halogen-substituted macrocations and/or silicododecatungstates.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhsFCisb3N&md5=2b5820564be97094bf84b0a3a66995e4", "(q) ", "Rube\u0161", ", ", "M.", "; ", "Wiersum", ", ", "A.

Due to the topol. of CuBTC, lateral interactions are significantly more important among the adsorbates located at the cage center and cage window sites (populated in the case of propane) than among adsorbates at the CUS and cage center sites (populated in the case of propylene).  Therefore, adsorption energies obtained for coverages >6 mmol g-1 of adsorbed amt. were larger for propane than for propylene.

The metal surfaces were modeled by two- or three-layered clusters consisting of 13-34 metal atoms.  Four kinds of adsorption sites were considered: atop bonding sites with the CC bond parallel and perpendicular to the \u23291\u203e10\u232a direction (ST and LT sites), a short bridge site with the CC bond parallel to the \u23291\u203e10\u232a direction (SB site), and a long bridge site with the CC bond perpendicular to the \u23291\u203e10\u232a direction (LB site).  The results of calcns. for three-layered models consisting of more than 20 metals could be compared reasonably with the exptl. data.  The comparison indicated that (i) upon increasing surface coverage, ethylene on Cu(110) converts its adsorption site from an SB to an ST site, (ii) ethylene adsorbs at an LT site of Ag(110), and (iii) ethylene on Pd(110) takes on an ST site.

The monovalent cations Ni+ and Cu+ show little preference toward the available cation sites: they approach a center of neg. framework charge, forming shorter M-O bonds as compared with the divalent cations.  Periodic model calcns. were applied to validate the extraframework site preference of Cu+ cations, and they confirm the ONIOM results, though periodic calcns. systematically predict smaller energy gaps between the different cation site occupancies.

Significant contribution of the framework oxygen atoms as electron donors to the cations was revealed.  This results in lengthening of the CC bond and a red shift of the corresponding stretching vibration, which is most pronounced in the adsorption complexes with monovalent cations, (Ni+, Cu+, Pd+).  The hydrogen atoms in the ethene mol. become nonequivalent upon adsorption.  The C-H bond lengthening is more significant for the adsorption complexes in channel B and on Ni+ cations in channel A.  The deformation d. maps, derived from the B3LYP calcd. densities provide insight into the role of the framework in the charge transfer from the metal cations to the ethene mol.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhs1aht7bE&md5=9c12583734a7d94b2c7b474dc465286f"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-24/ja502119z/production/images/small/ja-2014-02119z_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-24/ja502119z/production/images/small/ja-2014-02119z_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-24/ja502119z/production/images/small/ja-2014-02119z_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-24/ja502119z/production/images/small/ja-2014-02119z_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-24/ja502119z/production/images/small/ja-2014-02119z_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-24/ja502119z/production/images/small/ja-2014-02119z_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2014/jacsat.2014.136.issue-24/ja502119z/production/images/small/ja-2014-02119z_0006.gif\">"]}
