In general, any methodology that entails developing an accurate classical force field is computationally expensive as it requires a large number of quantum mechanical nonempirical calculations. In order to expedite such calculations without sacrificing too much accuracy, we have developed a systematic procedure where, starting from an initial trial force field, accurate adsorption isotherms of porous materials can be obtained at low computational cost. Specifically, the procedure involves correcting single-point energy values sampled from the trial force field in grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations from few quantum mechanical calculations. We demonstrate that the methodology yields accurate adsorption data in diverse selection of guest molecules in porous materials such as CH", " and CO", " in zeolites (i.e., MFI, LTA, WEI, RHO, SOD, FAU, RWY, and ABW) and CO", " in metal\u2013organic frameworks (i.e., M-MOF-74 with M = Mg, Fe). Furthermore, we use our corrected force fields to predict the adsorption properties of N", " in V-MOF-74 and Ti-MOF-74, which are two materials that have yet to be synthesized experimentally.

As the total number of experimentally synthesized MOFs continues to increase at a rapid pace, the ability to predict material properties prior to synthesis becomes critical for any rational MOF design. In particular, accurate characterization of the adsorption properties of porous materials becomes very important as it ties in directly with the storage and separation capabilities of the MOFs. In this regard, the experimental adsorption isotherm data provide a direct way to test the veracity of a given computational model as there should in principle be good agreement between the simulated and the experimental isotherm results upon adopting a correct model. From a computational perspective, accurate prediction of adsorption properties depends on the reliability of the force fields used to model the system in question. In the past, there have been several studies on large-scale screening of porous materials, but most of these works involved generic force fields, which may not yield accurate data for a large number of diverse structures.", "(8-14)", " In theory, one can bypass the force fields and instead conduct exclusively ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. Unfortunately, this approach is time-consuming as quantum mechanical total energy calculations are very expensive, and the number of calculations needed to accurately characterize most of the systems remains large.", "In order to improve computational efficiency, many efforts have focused on developing accurate force fields for porous materials.

Chen et al. conducted similar work on the Mg-MOF-74 structure where they used a multiobjective genetic algorithm to accurately fit over a thousand of single point energies, which resulted in good agreement with the experimental isotherms as well.", "(20)", " However, the aforementioned methods may involve a large number of quantum mechanical calculations, which imposes great difficulties in extensively implementing these methods in large-scale screening applications.

Compared to ab initio methods, a small amount of CPU time is required to compute an adsorption isotherm using conventional grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. For example, using one of the generic force fields such as the UFF or Dreiding, we can easily compute an adsorption isotherm curve at the conditions of interest. We take advantage of the fact that although such force fields might be initially inaccurate, they lead to a qualitatively correct description about the location of the adsorption sites as well as the shape of the channels and the pores. Consequently, one can start from an inaccurate force field and utilizing just a few quantum mechanical calculations converge to a model that leads to the correct adsorption properties. In this respect, our work is similar to the methodology proposed by Sauer and co-workers.", "(21)", " They constructed a multisite Langmuir isotherm as an \u201cestimate\u201d of the isotherm and used quantum mechanical calculations to obtain the parameters for this model.

On top of this, the methodology remains relatively unchanged regardless of the simulated material, making it ideal for large-scale screening.

In the past, we have developed an MP2-derived force field in this same system, demonstrating excellent agreement between the simulation and the experimental data. Accordingly, for our purpose, we can regard the MP2-derived force field as providing a high-quality reference result and subsequently gather millions of single point energy values at low computational cost, which can help better illustrate our methodology. In practice, for a structure where the force field is unknown, we will not have this information at our disposal. However, this does not pose a problem as our algorithm does not rely on collection of millions of single point energy calculations prior to the simulation. All of the classical molecular simulation data obtained from this work came from our in-house developed graphics processing units (GPU) code,", "(27)", " where the algorithm detail is described elsewhere.", "(27)", "For the initial step, a trial force field that can reasonably describe the system of interest should be chosen. In our case, the UFF and TraPPE force field parameters are selected to model the Mg-MOF-74 framework atoms and the CO", "2", " molecule, respectively, as these are commonly used force fields adopted by the community. In practice, our methodology should converge to the same model regardless of the initial force field choice. We will revisit this point later on in the paper.", "In general, the UFF force field provides the parameters for the short-range repulsions and dispersive interactions, while the Coulomb interactions follow from the charge distribution on the guest atoms and the MOFs. For the DFT-computed Mg-MOF-74 framework, point charges are obtained from the relaxed Mg-MOF-74 ab initio structure using the REPEAT scheme.", "(28)", " The Mg-MOF-74 structure was taken from our previous work,", "(19)", " in which the lattice vectors and atomic positions are fully relaxed using the DFT package Quantum Espresso.", "(29)", " The REPEAT scheme iteratively finds a set of framework point charges that minimizes the norm difference between the electrostatic potential of atomic charge model and the quantum mechanical self-consistent electrostatic potential. Because the REPEAT scheme incurs very little computational cost compared to the entire structure relaxation procedure, it is worthwhile to obtain these accurate point charge values for our methodology since the structures need to be relaxed before the classical simulation in most cases and especially for these open-metal site structures. Subsequently, the only difference between the MP2-derived force field and the trial force field comes from the short-range repulsion and the dispersive interaction energies between the CO", "2", " and the framework atoms. However, this discrepancy leads to drastically different adsorption data as the two sets of force field yields ", "K", "H", " = 1.13 \u00d7 10", "\u20133", " mol/(kg Pa) (MP2-derived force field) and ", "K", "H", " = 7.2 \u00d7 10", "\u20135", " mol/(kg Pa) (UFF) at ", "T", " = 313 K, resulting in two completely different adsorption isotherm curves as shown in Figure ", "1", "a. Comparison between the simulated and the experimental data verifies that the MP2-derived force field leads to a better fit with the previous experiments.", "(30)", " In our calculations, we assume that all metal sites are active without any defects present in the structure. However, it has been shown experimentally that about 20% of metal sites are inaccessible, which may be due to pore blocking or activation issue.", "(24)", " Accordingly, the MP2-derived computational model does not account for this imperfection and thus overestimates the adsorption data with the discrepancy becoming more pronounced at ", "P", " > 0.1 bar. To understand the source behind the difference between the adsorption data obtained MP2-derived force field and the trial (UFF) force field, the single point energy values are collected from random sampling. Specifically, over 8 million insertion moves are conducted on a preconstructed grid with a mesh size of 0.1 \u00c5, superimposed on top of the unit cell simulation volume. At each grid point, the single point energy calculation of a randomized CO", "2", " configuration is computed and then tabulated to obtain the normalized probability distribution shown in Figure ", "1", "b. As can be seen from Figure ", "1", "b, the shapes of the two curves look qualitatively similar, hinting that the trial force field manages to capture the potential energy surface of the guest\u2013framework interactions. This qualitative agreement has allowed us to understand the dynamic properties of CO", "2", " inside Mg-MOF-74 in our previous work with the trial force field (i.e., UFF).", "(31)", " Accordingly, minor corrections in the trial force field that artificially shift the single point curve toward the MP2-derived force field can lead to the correct Henry coefficient value. The total adsorption isotherm fit outside of the Henry regime will also depend on the guest\u2013guest (or, in this case, CO", "2", "\u2013CO", "2", ") interactions, which is modeled well by the TraPPE force field. The TraPPE force field has been shown to reproduce the CO", "2", " vapor\u2013liquid equilibria that are dominated by intermolecule interaction of the CO", "2", " molecules.", "Figure 1.

Accordingly, one can shift all of the energy values obtained during the molecular simulation using the trial force field by \u0394", "E", "binding", " to obtain a better fit to the MP2-derived energy distribution near the binding energy region.

In practice, the two binding energies, ", "E", "reference,binding", " and ", "E", "trial,binding", ", can be obtained from the DFT calculations and the classical canonical Monte Carlo simulations near ", "T", " = 0 K, respectively. And thus remarkably, with a single quantum mechanical binding energy calculation, one can potentially obtain adsorption properties much closer to the reference result.", "In principle, additional single point energy calculations can be utilized from the MP2-derived force field to converge even closer to the correct energy distribution curve. In practice, this would entail conducting more quantum mechanical calculations, which would enhance accuracy at additional computational cost. In general, there is not a clear-cut recipe on selecting the spatial location of a guest molecule for these single point energy quantum mechanical calculations. An idea suggested in this work is to sample near a local maximum region of the energy distribution curve at higher energies values and shift the trial force field to match these data points (e.g., region indicated by the two arrows in Figure ", "1", "b).", "This secondary shift is conducted near the local, normalized probability distribution maximum values, located between \u22126 and \u22123 kJ/mol in Figure ", "1", "b. Spatially, the local maximum region corresponds to the center of the one-dimensional channel in the Mg-MOF-74 structure.

In other words, the trial force field does a better job of capturing the correct adsorption properties far away from the strong binding adsorption sites. In practice, one could forego conducting additional quantum mechanical calculations at the pore center and assume that ", "E", "reference,center", " = ", "E", "trial,center", " = \u22123.33 kJ/mol in order to reduce the large computational cost incurred while retaining similar level of accuracy.", "Taking account these two shifts, all of the energy values less than ", "E", "reference,center", " are shifted by \u0394", "E", "center", ", and at the binding energy, the energy is shifted by \u0394", "E", "binding", ". In between the two points, we opt for a linearized shift such that \u0394", "E", "shift", " increases linearly from ", "E", "trial,center", " and ", "E", "trial,binding", ". The resulting shifted curve is displayed in Figure ", "1", "b in blue, and it agrees very well with the MP2-derived distribution.

Our results are summarized in the ", "Supporting Information", " where computational results for both the CO", "2", " ", "K", "H", " and the full isotherms are reported at varying CO", "2", " binding energies. Overall, the stability analysis illustrates the importance of obtaining accurate quantum mechanical binding energies for this system in the context of our methodology. As expected, when the binding energies become inaccurate, the adsorption properties deviate from the reference results.", "Next, the effect of the initial choice in the trial force field is analyzed. An algorithm in which the final adsorption data are completely independent of the choice in the trial force field is ideal.

The results here indicate that decreasing ", "q", "C,CO", "2", " effectively reduces the energy spread (i.e., energy difference between the minima point and the local maximum point in the curve) within the distribution. This is reasonable as imposing stronger electrostatic interactions cause sharper peaks in the minima energy. Moreover, the local peak in the distributions corresponds to the center of the pore region where the sum of the electrostatic interaction contributions is small, thus making it independent of charge. Accordingly, for smaller ", "q", "C,CO", "2", " in the initial trial force field, the subsequent shift will cause a greater overestimation in the infinite dilution adsorption property as there will be proportionally more single point energies near the binding energy region when the energy spread is small. Mathematically, this effect can be visualized upon subtracting the shifted trial force energy distributions from the MP2-derived distribution (Figure ", "2", "b). As can be seen from Figure ", "2", "b, for smaller ", "q", "C,CO", "2", ", the overestimate from the trial force field increases between \u221235 and \u221218 kJ/mol.

The capacity enhancement in MTV-MOFs arises from an increase in both vdW (due to tighter geometry) and electrostatic (due to increased dipole moment) interactions between CO2 and MTV-MOF.  The authors predict that MOF-5-NO2 can have an even higher CO2 uptake than these MTV-MOFs due to a larger local dipole moment of the NO2-functionalized linker than those found in the reported MTV-MOFs.  As a further design of high capacity material, the authors then introduced both electron-donating and -withdrawing functional groups simultaneously in the same org. linker to increase the local dipole moment of the linker significantly.  The resulting CO2 uptake indeed increases substantially due to the favorable electrostatic interactions that can be tested exptl.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhtlSksrjK&md5=bfadbc5853ddfbb10ddf1dd971e0dbdd", "19.

One important aspect of the structural anal. of materials such as zeolites and metal org. frameworks is the investigation of the geometrical parameters describing pores.  Here, we present algorithms and tools to efficiently calc. some of these important parameters.  Our tools are based on the Voronoi decompn., which for a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph representation of the void space.  The resulting Voronoi network is analyzed to obtain the diam. of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters that are frequently used to describe pore geometry.  Accessibility of nodes in the network is also detd. for a given guest mol. and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible surfaces and vols.  The presented algorithms are implemented in a software tool, Zeo++, which includes a modified version of the Voro++ library.  We present example applications of our algorithms and tools using zeolite frameworks currently listed in the Atlas of Zeolite Frameworks.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXht12jurjN&md5=28e97cac049214d18c5a964ab405c4d9"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-5/jp412368m/production/images/small/jp-2013-12368m_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-5/jp412368m/production/images/small/jp-2013-12368m_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-5/jp412368m/production/images/small/jp-2013-12368m_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-5/jp412368m/production/images/small/jp-2013-12368m_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-5/jp412368m/production/images/small/jp-2013-12368m_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-5/jp412368m/production/images/small/jp-2013-12368m_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-5/jp412368m/production/images/small/jp-2013-12368m_0007.gif\">"]}
