While a number of water-stable MOFs have emerged recently in the literature, the majority of MOFs are known to have poor water stability compared to zeolites and activated carbons, and there is therefore a critical need to perform systematic water-stability studies and characterize MOFs comprehensively after water exposure. Using these studies we can isolate the specific factors governing the structural stability of MOFs and direct the future synthesis efforts toward the construction of new, water-stable MOFs. In this work, we have extended our previous work on the systematic water-stability studies of MOFs and synthesized new, cobalt-, nickel-, copper-, and zinc-based, water-stable, pillared MOFs by incorporating structural factors such as ligand sterics and catenation into the framework. Stability is assessed by using water vapor adsorption isotherms along with powder X-ray diffraction patterns and results from BET modeling of N", " adsorption isotherms before and after water exposure. As expected, our study demonstrates that unlike the parent DMOF structures (based on Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn metals), which all collapse under 60% relative humidity (RH), their corresponding tetramethyl-functionalized variations (DMOF-TM) are remarkably stable, even when adsorbing more than 20 mmol of H", "O/g of MOF at 80% RH. This behavior is due to steric factors provided by the methyl groups grafted on the BDC (benzenedicarboxylic acid) ligand, as shown previously for the Zn-based DMOF-TM. Moreover, 4,4\u2032,4\u2033,4\u2034-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrabenzoic acid based, pillared MOFs (based on Co and Zn metals) are also found to be stable after 90% RH exposure, even when the basicity of the bipyridyl-based pillar ligand is low. This is due to the presence of catenation in their frameworks, similar to MOF-508 (Zn-BDC-BPY), which has also been reported to be stable after exposure to 90% RH."], "text": ["Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results and Discussion", "Conclusion", "References", "1 Introduction", "Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by the self-assembly of organic ligands and metal-containing nodes.", "(1)", " MOFs have garnered much attention in a variety of fields related to porous materials, such as sensing,", "(1, 2)", " adsorption-based gas storage,", "(1-7)", " gas separation,", "(1, 2, 5, 7-10)", " catalysis,", "(1-3, 5, 7, 11)", " and drug delivery.", "(1, 2, 11)", " This is due to their record-breaking values of surface area and pore volume, facile pore tunability, and almost infinite set of structure possibilities with diverse topologies.

PXRD is a simple technique that provides information about the long-range crystallinity of the structure, though it is not capable of detecting short-range surface collapse. Hence, it is a qualitative technique and not a comprehensive way to characterize MOFs after water exposure. This has led to misleading conclusions about the water stability of MOFs. For example, Jasuja and Walton", "(19)", " and Liu et al.", "(44)", " reported contrasting observations about the stability of MOF-508 (Zn-BDC-BPY), with the former highlighting the need for surface area analysis in addition to PXRD to reach a conclusion with a higher confidence level.", "Overall, it has been seen that the strength of the bond between the metal centers and the ligand is a strong indicator of the MOF hydrothermal stability.", "(16)", " Carboxylate-ligand-based MOFs, such as MOF-5 and UMCM-1, are highly unstable under humid conditions due to the low basicity (p", "K", "a", ") of carboxylate ligands and the low coordination number of their metal centers (only four-coordinated).", "(16, 17, 49, 50)", " However, some other carboxylate-ligand-based MOFs, such as UiO-66(Zr),", "(32)", " MIL-125(Ti),", "(27)", " PCN-56-59(Zr),", "(45)", " DUT-51,67-69,", "(28, 46)", " and MIL-140(Zr),", "(47)", " have been reported to be water-stable due to the high oxophilicity and coordination number of their metal centers (eight-coordinated).", "(16)", " Similarly, other carboxylate-based MOFs, such as MIL-53(Cr)", "(21)", " and MIL-101(Cr),", "(39)", " are water-stable, as their metal centers are inert toward water, and hence, now MOF hydrolysis is unfavorable.

Ligand functionalization is a promising approach for manipulating the kinetic factors that play a significant role in the stability of the framework. It has been reported earlier that MOF stability in humid environments can be improved by incorporating hydrophobic functional groups,", "(20, 25, 29, 33-38, 43, 48)", " such as alkyl or fluorinated groups, but there is a need to decouple hydrophobicity from steric effects by measuring water adsorption isotherms.

Hence, it is difficult to conclude whether the MOF is now inherently more stable due to a change in ligand sterics or is stable simply due to the increase in hydrophobicity as a result of functionalization with nonpolar groups. Thus, there is a critical requirement in the MOF field to perform systematic water-stability studies, and water-exposed MOFs should be characterized comprehensively so that we can isolate the specific factors governing structural stability of MOFs and direct the future synthesis efforts toward the construction of new, water-stable MOFs.", "The explanation of the MOF degradation mechanisms under humid environments is a very complex problem, because there are various independent factors that play a critical role in the stability of MOFs. To decouple the effects of metal\u2013ligand coordination environment, topology, porosity, metal-type, and ligand-type on the structural stability of MOFs, studies on isostructural series of MOFs are needed in order to systematically study the impact of each specific factor on the MOF water stability by only varying that specific factor. The effect of the metal-type incorporated in MOF systems, such as MOF-74 and DMOF, on the water stability was examined by Liu et al.", "(26)", " and Tan et al.,", "(15)", " respectively.

Our study shows that, unlike the parent DMOF structure, which collapses under 60% RH, tetramethyl-functionalized variations or DMOF-TM are remarkably stable, even when they have very high water vapor adsorption loadings (> 20 mmol/g at 80% RH). These methyl groups grafted on the BDC ligand introduce steric factors around the metal centers. BTTB-based, pillared MOFs are synthesized with bipyridyl-based, pillar ligands, which have lower basicity than DABCO but are still stable after exposure to 90% RH due to the presence of catenation in their frameworks, similar to MOF-508, which also has been reported to be stable after 90% RH exposure.

Finally, the mild and efficient activation of initially solvent-filled pores with supercrit. carbon dioxide, yielding usable channels and high internal surface areas is discussed.  Now constituting thousands of distinct examples, metal-org. frameworks are an intriguing class of hybrid materials that exist as infinite cryst. lattices with inorg. vertices and mol.-scale org. connectors.  Useful properties such as large internal surface areas, ultralow densities, and the availability of uniformly structured cavities and portals of mol. dimensions characterize functional metal-org. frameworks.  Researchers have effectively exploited these unusual properties in applications such as hydrogen and methane storage, chem. sepns., and selective chem. catalysis.  One of the most attractive features of metal-org. frameworks is the simplicity of their synthesis.  Typically they are obtained via one-pot solvothermal prepns.  However, metal-org. framework materials, esp. more complex ones, can be difficult to obtain in pure form and with the optimal degree of catenation, the interpenetration or interweaving of identical independent networks.  Once these two issues are satisfied, the removal of the guest mols. (solvent from synthesis) without damaging the structural integrity of the material is often an addnl. challenge.

However, the systematic water stability studies required to develop design criteria for the construction of water-stable MOFs are still scarce.  In this work, the authors show that by varying the functional groups on the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) linker of DMOF [Zn(BDC)(DABCO)0.5], they can systematically tune the kinetic water stability of this isostructural, pillared family of MOFs.  To illustrate this concept, water adsorption studies were performed on four novel, methyl-functionalized DMOF variations along with a no. of already reported functionalized analogs contg. polar (fluorine) and nonpolar (methyl) functional groups on the BDC ligand.  These results are distinctly different from previous reports where the apparent water stability is improved through the inclusion of functional groups such as -CH3, -C2H5, and -CF3 which only serve to prevent significant amts. of water from adsorbing into the pores.  In this study, the authors present the first demonstration of tuning the inherent kinetic stability of MOF structures in the presence of large amts. of adsorbed water.  Notably, while the parent DMOF structure is unstable, the DMOF variation contg. the tetra-Me BDC ligand remains fully stable after adsorbing large amts. of water vapor during cyclic water adsorption cycles.  These trends cannot be rationalized in terms of hydrophobicity alone; exptl. water isotherms show that MOFs contg. the same no. of Me groups per unit cell will have different kinetic stabilities and that the precise placements of the Me groups on the BDC ligand are therefore critically important in detg. their stability in the presence of water.  Water adsorption isotherms, PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) patterns, and BET surface areas before and after water exposure are presented to illustrate these trends.

The work reported here seeks to address this crit. issue by examg. two important contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pKa value) of the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework.  Catenation is the interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and independent frameworks.  Using catenation in combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pKa value).  After 90% relative humidity (RH) exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508), MOF-508 is stable due to its 2-fold interpenetration that prevents significant water adsorption.  In contrast, comparing noncatenated isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM) and Zn-TMBDC-BPY (MOF-508-TM), MOF-508-TM is unstable since BPY is less basic (higher pKa) and less rigid than DABCO.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhs1ehs7fM&md5=aa2a36a83aff9f403c6ba44f98ac074a", "20.

However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "33.

These results suggest that there are two opposing and competitive effects brought on by Me functionalization: the enhancement due to increased isosteric heats of CO2 adsorption (Qst), and the detraction due to the redn. of surface area and pore vol.  For 1', the enhancement effect dominates, which leads to a significantly higher uptake of CO2 than its parent compd. 3' (guest-free 3).

CO2-adsorption studies indicate substantially enhanced isosteric heats of CO2 adsorption (Qst) for both compds. as a result of adding Me groups to the BPY ligand.  The CO2 uptake capacity, however, is affected by two opposing and competing factors: the enhancement due to increased MMOF-CO2 interactions (higher Qst values) and detraction due to the surface area and pore-vol. redn.  For 1' (the guest-free form of 1), the pos. effect dominates, which leads to a significantly higher uptake of CO2 than that of its parent structure 3' (the guest-free form of 3).  In 2' (the guest-free form of 2), however, the neg. effect rules, which results in a slightly lower CO2 uptake with respect to 4' (the guest-free form of 4).

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of cryst., porous materials that exhibit very large BET surface areas.  These materials are microporous and possess surfaces that are far from flat.  In some MOFs, adsorption occurs through a pore-filling mechanism rather than by layer formation.  Thus, it is unclear whether BET surface area nos. reported for these materials are truly meaningful.  Given the std. practice of reporting BET surface areas for novel porous materials, a crit. test of the BET method is much needed.  Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict adsorption isotherms for nitrogen in MOFs.  The predicted isotherms were used as pseudoexperimental data to test the applicability of the BET theory for obtaining surface areas of microporous MOFs.  BET surface areas calcd. from the simulated isotherms agree very well with the accessible surface areas calcd. directly from the crystal structures in a geometric fashion.

Using high-resoln. neutron power diffraction technique, we found the first direct structural evidence showing that real UiO-66 material contains significant amt. of missing-linker defects, an unusual phenomenon for MOFs.  The concn. of the missing-linker defects is surprisingly high, \u223c10% in our sample, effectively reducing the framework connection from 12 to \u223c11.  We show that by varying the concn. of the acetic acid modulator and the synthesis time, the linker vacancies can be tuned systematically, leading to dramatically enhanced porosity.  We obtained samples with pore vols. ranging from 0.44 to 1.0 cm3/g and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas ranging from 1000 to 1600 m2/g, the largest values of which are \u223c150% and \u223c60% higher than the theor. values of defect-free UiO-66 crystal, resp.  The linker vacancies also have profound effects on the gas adsorption behaviors of UiO-66, in particular CO2.  Finally, comparing the gas adsorption of hydroxylated and dehydroxylated UiO-66, we found that the former performs systematically better than the latter (particularly for CO2) suggesting the beneficial effect of the -OH groups.  This finding is of great importance because hydroxylated UiO-66 is the practically more relevant, non-air-sensitive form of this MOF.

Outstanding \"S\"-shaped (type V) adsorption isotherms are obsd. for MIL-68 type solids.  The underlying mechanism of water adsorption can be rationalized using a simple set of three parameters: the Henry const. (i.e. the slope of the adsorption pressure in the low pressure range), the pressure at which pore filling occurs, and the max. water adsorption capacity.  While the Henry const. and pore filling pressure mostly depend on the affinity of water for the surface chem. and on pore size, resp., these two parameters are correlated as they both reflect different aspects of the hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity of the material.  For a given type of porous structure, the functionalization of the material by hydrophilic moieties such as hydrogen bonding groups (amine or aldehyde) systematically leads to an increase in the Henry const. concomitantly with a decrease in the pore filling pressure.  As for the adsorption mechanism, for a given temp. there is a crit. diam.
