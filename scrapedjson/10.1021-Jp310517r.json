The relatively strong metal-CO2 binding was attributed to an enhanced electrostatic interaction, and vibrational mode anal. shows that the adsorbed CO2 mol. is strongly attached through one of its oxygen atoms while the rest of the mol. is relatively free.  This high orientational disorder is the reason for the large apparent O-C-O bond bending angle derived from diffraction measurements.  The calcns. give only a small degree of bond bending, suggesting that the CO2 adsorption on the open metal site is still largely physisorption.  The overall metal-CO2 binding strength is right in the range which can facilitate both adsorption (CO2 capture) and desorption (MOF regeneration) under typical flue gas conditions.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXntFyrsLg%253D&md5=a4a7d5e20cf66bd0d3e96f10964d1c44", "11.

Adsorption expts., ideal adsorbed soln. theory (IAST) predictions, breakthrough expts., 1st-principles calcns., and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations reveal that Co-MOF-74 exhibits the highest thermodn. propene/propane selectivity (\u223c46) ever reported for MOFs, due to strong \u03c0-complexation between the open Co2+ sites and the propene mols.  The trend of selectivities for M-MOF-74 materials is explained well by the binding strengths from 1st-principles calcns.  For all M-MOF-74 materials, the selectivity increases with increasing pressure due to the special structural properties of these MOFs: high densities of metal sites as well as optimal pore widths and vols.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xnt12hsA%253D%253D&md5=e539dd5baab9851a42c66a323ac7928c", "(b) ", "He", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Krishna", ", ", "R.", "; ", "Chen", ", ", "B.", " ", "Metal-Organic Frameworks with Potential for Energy-Efficient Adsorptive Separation of Light Hydrocarbons", " ", "Energy Environ.

Two types of binding sites for Na+ ions are identified in the framework.  Site I is in the single eight-membered ring, whereas site II is in the \u03b1-cage. Na+ ions at site I have a stronger affinity for the framework and thus a smaller mobility.  The binding sites in rho-ZMOF resemble those in its inorg. counterpart rho-zeolite. CO2 is adsorbed predominantly over other gases because of its strong electrostatic interactions with the charged framework and the presence of Na+ ions acting as addnl. adsorption sites.  At ambient temp. and pressure, the CO2 selectivities are 1800 for the CO2/H2 mixt., 80 for the CO2/CH4 mixt., and 500 for the CO2/N2 mixt.  Compared with other MOFs and nanoporous materials reported to date, rho-ZMOF exhibits unprecedentedly high selective adsorption for these gas mixts.  This work represents the 1st simulation study to characterize extraframework ions and examine gas sepn. in a charged ZMOF.

The mol. models treat the adsorbent as a matrix of particles arranged in a predefined microstructure, and the parameters are chosen to represent the adsorption of simple mols. in silica gel.  Three different adsorbent microstructures were considered, allowing study of the role of translational order and connectivity among the matrix particles in detg. the heat of adsorption.  The contributions from the adsorbate-solid and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions to the heat of adsorption were calcd. sep..  A comparison with exptl. data for CH4 in silica gel is made.  The authors revisit the derivation of expressions used to det. heats of adsorption and present a new derivation which is free from some unnecessary assumptions used previously.  In addn., these results are tested for thermodn. consistency, and the accuracy of different methods for obtaining the isosteric heat from the Monte Carlo simulations is also studied.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28XmtV2qur8%253D&md5=f09054b6285af96b32f4be987afb3974", "36.
