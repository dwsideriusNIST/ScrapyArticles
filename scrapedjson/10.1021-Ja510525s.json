As a solid-state material with periodic structure and porosity, MOFs consequently make those functional moieties well-dispersed with extremely high accessibility, resulting in effective utilization of each individual unit. In other words, the homogeneous arrangement and accessibility of functional moieties, which are among the main advantages of homogeneous liquid or gas systems, are almost completely realized in a heterogeneous solid-state material. Moreover, once stable MOFs are formed, they can be used in different media without concern for solubility, which tremendously diminishes the synthetic effort required for some homogeneous catalytic systems, where solubility and their working environment conflict.", "Porphyrin derivatives have been substantially explored as organic linkers in MOFs because of their multifunctionality.", "(3)", "As one of the most frequently found species in biological systems, porphyrin derivatives can be used as light-harvesting reagents, anticancer drugs, catalysts, sensors, nonlinear optical materials, and DNA binding or cleavage agents. After their introduction into MOFs, the dimerization of some porphyrinic species was eliminated. Meanwhile, as highly conjugated large molecules, most artificial porphyrinic species suffer solubility problems under either physiological conditions or unreactive organic solvents (mostly nonpolar). When immobilized into MOFs, porphyrinic species can be used in any media without considering their solubility.

Moreover, less or weaker competing reagent is needed for PCN-223 compared with PCN-222, which not only kinetically accelerates MOF growth but also facilitates the formation of an entropically favored product.", "(7)", "In order to assess the porosities of PCN-223(Free base) and PCN-223(Fe), we performed N", "2", " sorption measurements at 77 K (Figure ", "3", "b).

The hDA reaction is one of the most powerful synthetic approaches for the construction of six-membered heterocyclic compounds. In particular, the cycloaddition of aldehydes to dienes has been widely applied in the preparation of natural products.", "(8a)", " However, most of these reactions involve the use of activated aldehydes such as glyoxylates or electron-rich dienes such as Danishefsky\u2019s diene to reach high yields. Only a small number of hDA reactions using unactivated aldehydes and simple dienes have been reported.", "(8b)", " Moreover, the use of very strong Br\u00f8nsted acids or Lewis acids is always necessary to activate the poorly reactive heterodienophile to compensate for the low reactivity of simple dienes, which severely restricts the choice of functional groups that can be tolerated under such harsh reaction conditions. Recently, Fujiwara et al.", "(8c)", " reported catalysis of the hDA reaction of unactivated aldehydes and simple dienes using an iron(III) porphyrinic cation, which showed high catalytic performance and robustness in the reaction.", "Since the cationic iron(III) porphyrin has very strong affinity for all electron-donating species, the synthesis and handling have to be conducted under an inert environment. However, when porphyrinic MOFs are used, the catalysts can be conveniently recycled, which could save a lot of effort for making new catalyst and for product separation. Following the synthetic procedure in the reported homogeneous system, we made the cationic Fe(III) porphyrin center in PCN-223(Fe) and tested its catalytic performance using the same substrates (Scheme ", "1", "). The potential blocking of cationic sites and pores of PCN-223(Fe) due to the generation of AgCl precipitates was of great concern but could not be directly measured because of the high activity of cationic PCN-223(Fe). Remarkably, the reaction of benzaldehyde with 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene reached 99% yield, as confirmed by both column chromatography (NMR) and GC (Table ", "1", "), which is even higher than that reported in the optimal homogeneous system. It is also worth noting that we employed toluene as the solvent instead of the carcinogenic benzene, which is the optimized solvent in the reported homogeneous system. Since the catalytic mechanism is to use the naked cationic iron(III) center to polarize the aldehyde species, electron-withdrawing groups on the porphyrin should increase the polarization ability of the iron center and thus enhance the catalytic activity. To eliminate other possible reactive centers, two control experiments were performed with PCN-223(Free base) and PCN-223(Fe) with no AgBF", "4", " additive to confirm that only the cationic PCN-223(Fe) is active toward the catalysis of the hDA reaction. Therefore, the higher catalytic activity in cationic PCN-223(Fe) compared with the homogeneous system could be ascribed to two possible reasons: carboxylate itself is an electron-withdrawing group, which could decrease the electron density on the iron center; meanwhile, because of its high ", "Z", "/", "r", " value, zirconium could be considered as an extremely effective electron-withdrawing group, which would dramatically decrease the electron density on the porphyrin after bonding to the carboxylates. Both effects could further increase the polarization ability of the iron center and increase the overall catalytic activity. Such an extraordinary result also highlights the advantages of using MOFs as heterogeneous systems. Because of their porous frameworks, MOFs can be used as heterogeneous catalysts in any solvent despite the solubility of the catalyst, in contrast to homogeneous systems, which always require extra synthetic effort to find the appropriate solvent, greatly limiting the scope of the catalytic reaction. For instance, although carboxylate groups might enhance the catalytic activity, TCPP has very low solubility in nonpolar solvents, so it cannot be used alone in benzene or toluene. Furthermore, the inorganic units could further increase the activity of the linker instead of acting as pure spectators; however, these inorganic clusters would be useless in a homogeneous system because of their limited solubility in common organic solvents. This illustrates that when MOFs are applied in a suitable system, the metal-containing nodes, organic linkers, and framework porosity can be most effectively integrated to enhance the utility of a catalytic system. Of course, it is still necessary to optimize the reaction conditions, such as temperature, substrate solubility, and even substrate diffusion from the solvent toward the porous catalyst.", "Scheme 1.

Commensurate adsorption is an interesting and important phenomenon occurring during adsorption processes, where the mol. size and shape of the adsorbate (guest mol.) lead to an orientation and adsorbed amt.

As a new type of adsorbate material with distinctly advantageous features, microporous metal org. frameworks (MMOFs) demonstrate enormous potential for adsorption based applications, including storage, sepn., and purifn. of small gases and hydrocarbons.  Commensurate adsorption of hydrocarbons occurs far more often in MMOFs than in zeolites and related materials, primarily as a result of a vastly greater variety of framework types and richer hierarchy of complexity of the pore structures for the former.  Among numerous structures in which commensurate adsorption has been obsd. in the vicinity of room temp., many have 1D open channels built on pore segments of distinct shape, size, and narrow pore window that closely match with the geometries of hydrocarbon species.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XpsVOhtA%253D%253D&md5=5c1aad767ab767e289d672529b50f640", "(i) ", "Wang", ", ", "C.", "; ", "Zhang", ", ", "T.", "; ", "Lin", ", ", "W.", " ", "Chem.

Herein, the first example is reported of directional, long-distance energy migration within a MOF.  Two MOFs, namely F-MOF and DA-MOF that are composed of two Zn(II) porphyrin struts [5,15-dipyridyl-10,20-bis(pentafluorophenyl)porphinato]zinc(II) and [5,15-bis[4-(pyridyl)ethynyl]-10,20-diphenylporphinato]zinc(II), resp., were investigated.  From fluorescence quenching expts. and theor. calcns., it is found that the photogenerated exciton migrates over a net distance of up to \u223c45 porphyrin struts within its lifetime in DA-MOF (but only \u223c3 in F-MOF), with a high anisotropy along a specific direction.  The remarkably efficient exciton migration in DA-MOF is attributed to enhanced \u03c0-conjugation through the addn. of two acetylene moieties in the porphyrin mol., which leads to greater Q-band absorption intensity and much faster exciton-hopping (energy transfer between adjacent porphyrin struts).

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "(b) ", "Jiang", ", ", "H.-L.", "; ", "Feng", ", ", "D.", "; ", "Li", ", ", "J.-R.", "; ", "Liu", ", ", "T.-F.", "; ", "Zhou", ", ", "H.-C.", " ", "J.

These criteria deal with condensation pressure of water in the pores, uptake capacity, and recyclability and water stability of the material.  Water adsorption properties of 23 materials were investigated, 20 of which being metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  Among the MOFs were 10 zirconium(IV) MOFs with a subset of these, MOF-801-SC (single crystal form), -802, -805, -806, -808, -812, and -841 reported for the first time.  MOF-801-P (microcryst. powder form) was reported earlier and studied here for its water adsorption properties.  MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized but not examd. for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of MOF-841 synthesis.  All the new zirconium MOFs are made from the Zr6O4(OH)4(-CO2) secondary building units (n = 6, 8, 10, or 12) and variously shaped carboxyl org. linkers to make extended porous frameworks.  The permanent porosity of all 23 materials was confirmed and their water adsorption measured to reveal that MOF-801-P and MOF-841 are the highest performers based on the three criteria stated above; they are water stable, do not lose capacity after five adsorption/desorption cycles, and are easily regenerated at room temp.
