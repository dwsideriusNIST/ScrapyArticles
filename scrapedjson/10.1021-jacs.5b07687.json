Compd. 2 features a 2-fold interpenetrating 4-connected bbf-type framework based on new [Cu4I4(INA)2(DBO)2]2- metalloligands (DBO = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) and paddle-wheel Zn2(COO)4 units.  The 2-fold interpenetrating diamond-type framework 3 is constructed from tetrahedral [Cu4I4(INA)4]4- metalloligand and Mn2(COO)4(H2O)2(DMF) unit with potential open Mn centers.  All three framework materials have notable catalytic activity on the diethylzinc addn. to arom. aldehydes, and the catalytic properties of compd. 1 have been studied.

Systematic ligand modulation led to the identification of a set of frameworks with unusually high stability toward H2O vapor.  These frameworks lose no porosity after 100 days' exposure to ambient air or 20 adsorption-desorption cycles up to 70% relative humidity.  Across this series of frameworks, a counterintuitive relation between the length of pendant alkyl groups and framework stability toward H2O vapor emerges.  This phenomenon was probed via gas and vapor adsorption expts. together with Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and could be rationalized from the propensity of the frameworks to adsorb H2O vapor and the proximity of the adsorbed H2O mols. to the H2O-sensitive metal clusters.

This topol. violates a long-standing thesis where highly sym. building units are expected to yield highly sym. networks.  In the case of octahedron and triangle combinations, MOFs based on pyrite (pyr) and rutile (rtl) nets were expected instead of qom.

The position of the functional groups on the BTB unit allows the selection for a specific net (qom, pyr, and rtl), and mixing of functionalities (-H, -NH2, and -C4H4) is an important strategy for the incorporation of a specific functionality (-NO2) into MOF-177 where otherwise incorporation of such functionality would be difficult.

A systematic investigation of silver nanocluster formation within MOFs using three representative MOF templates is reported.  The as-synthesized clusters are spectroscopically consistent with dimensions \u22641 nm, with a significant fraction existing as Ag3 clusters, as shown by ESR.  Importantly, rapid TEM-induced MOF degrdn. leads to agglomeration and stable, easily imaged particles, and explains prior reports of particles larger than MOF pores.

The chem. very robust zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a subclass of MOFs.  The authors chose the microporous sodalite-like ZIF-8 (Zn(MeIM)2; IM = imidazolate) and ZIF-90 (Zn(ICA)2; ICA = imidazolate-2-carboxyaldehyde) as host matrixes to influence the dispersion of imbedded gold nanoparticles (Au NPs).  The metal loading was achieved via gas phase infiltration of [Au(CO)Cl] followed by a thermal hydrogenation step to form the Au NPs.  Low-dose high-resoln. TEM ((HR)TEM) and electron tomog. reveal a homogeneous distribution of Au NPs throughout the ZIF matrix.  The functional groups of ZIF-90 direct the anchoring of intermediate Au species and stabilize drastically smaller and quite monodisperse Au NPs in contrast to the parent not functionalized ZIF-8.  The particles can be very small, match the cavity size and approach defined mol. clusters of magic nos., i.e., Au55, independently from the level of loading.  Post-synthetic oxidn. of the aldehyde groups to yield alkyl esters by the adjacent, catalytically active metal NPs is presented as a new concept of encapsulating nanoparticles inside MOFs and allows multiple steps of metal loadings without decompn. of the MOF.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhsVaisr%252FI&md5=c88d2fd4ddce3352cb0fba27baf8a023", "20.
