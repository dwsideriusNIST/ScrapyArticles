We constructed and optimized the corresponding networks, termed Cu-BTB here for brevity, in both topologies. The relative lattice energies (Table ", "1", ") reveal now a preference of the ", "pto", " structure by 15.3 kcal/mol. The closeup of the linker structure in Figure ", "2", "c shows clearly that in the ", "tbo", " topology the nonplanar BTB core does not fit to the constraint of carboxylate units in the trigonal plane.

This behavior is therefore referred to as interweaving, and for the following discussion it is necessary to analyze the different interpenetration modes of the ", "tbo", " and ", "pto", " networks in general. The interpenetrated ", "tbo", " can be generated by shifting the second net by [1/4, 1/4, 1/4] (fractional coordinates) with respect to the primary, thus filling its pore space. In Figure ", "3", " the interpenetrated networks are shown in augmented form. In the case of ", "pto", ", shifting an identical copy of the primary network by [1/2, 1/2, 1/2] leads to a situation where the trigonal vertices of both networks coincide. Only by a distortion of the networks via a displacement of the trigonal vertices away from each other, two nonintersecting interwoven networks can be formed as shown in Figure ", "3", "b. Note that if one connects the neighboring trigonal vertices of the two networks, which are rotated by 180\u00b0 with respect to each other, an octahedral six-coordinated vertex is formed, and the resulting noninterpenetrated net is now 4,6-connected (referred to as ", "pto-d", " in the RCSR database", "(49)", "). Since in the resulting interwoven ", "pto", " net (Figure ", "3", "b) only the square vertices occupy pore space of the other network, the resulting structure is very rigid, but still porous. For a further discussion we refer here also to ref 53.", "It is gratifying that our flexible force field is able to explain the steric preference for the ", "pto", " topology in the case of Cu-BTB. However, the structure of the interwoven MOF-14, determined experimentally, poses an additional challenge, due to the steric deformation of each individual net. To address this problem, we also investigated all possible interpenetrated systems of Cu-BTC and Cu-BTB in both topologies ", "tbo", " and ", "pto", ". In the following discussion we use the terms \u201cinterpenetrated\u201d and \u201cinterwoven\u201d as synonyms, since the latter is just a special variant. In principle, steric energies of interpenetrated nets can be compared with non-interpenetrated ones in the same way as different topologies, since all structures reside on the same molecular mechanics potential energy surface. However, in this case it is more difficult to assess the preference of the real system. Because of the additional close contacts between the nets a mainly dispersive stabilization in the gas phase is usually observed. In real systems, this stabilization could be compensated by difference in the free energy of solvation. In the case of an attractive interaction between solvent and network, interpenetration leads to a destabilizing reduction of the SAS. The entropic contributions to the free energy of solvation in the microporous framework are not easy to assess and depend also on the type and size of the solvent. In particular, open metal site frameworks can coordinate donor solvents, and a delicate hydrogen bonding network can be formed. We are currently extending our force fields to include these interactions and are developing simulation protocols to determine the changes in solvent free energy when going from one topology to another or changing the interpenetration mode. Note that this problem is closely related to the solvation of biomolecules. The native state of a protein structure can often only be described by including the free energy of solvation including \u2018\u2018nanoscaled\u2019\u2019 cavities or pores.", "(64)", " However, such a treatment including a sampling of the solvent configurational space is beyond the scope of this work. Thus, we have used a simple and qualitative measure for the possibility of solvent stabilization, namely the determination of the SAS with a probe diameter of 3 \u00c5. This is a typical value for water, often used for the evaluation of solvation energies of biomolecules.", "(65)", " Interestingly, the same approach is used to determine the inner surface of porous hybrid materials.", "(59)", "Figure 3. Interpenetrated ", "tbo", " and ", "pto", " networks in augmented form.", "The computed SAS values summarized in Table ", "1", " are given per formula unit, since we consider them to be roughly proportional to the solvent stabilization energy per formula unit. For the Cu-BTC systems the ", "pto", " topology has about half the accessible surface, as compared to ", "tbo", ", even though it is only by a factor of 1.3 more dense. Interestingly, in the case of the larger Cu-BTB systems both topologies are nearly equal in surface size, with ", "pto", " having a slightly larger SAS. In the case of the Cu-BTC, interpenetration reduces the accessible surfaces by an order of magnitude. These systems are essentially nonporous, and a sufficient solvent framework interaction will lead to a large energy penalty for interpenetration. In contrast to that, for the Cu-BTB systems, the reduction is about a factor of 2. This is what can be expected for very large pores, where\u2014in analogy to two infinite planes\u2014maximizing the contact would halve the accessible surface per formula unit.", "From an energetic point of view, interpenetration does not change the tendency to form a ", "tbo", " structure for the BTC linker, nor for ", "pto", " in the case of the larger BTB. As mentioned above, however, interpenetration in the gas phase is always stabilizing. Thus, from the bare gas phase steric energies the nonporous interpenetrated Cu-BTC in ", "tbo", " structure appears to be most stable. This stabilization will largely be reduced by the loss in solvation free energy. A close inspection of the structure of this system even reveals that it might be unlikely to be formed under real growth conditions: a phenylene hydrogen atom of one net is situated just 3.22 \u00c5 away from a copper site of the other net, exactly in the direction of the Cu-dimer axis. Under growth conditions a solvent molecule like water or ethanol will be strongly bonded to this copper atom. By positioning an axial water ligand at a Cu\u2013O", "H", "2", "O", " distance of 2.3 \u00c5", "(37, 45)", " a short contact below 1 \u00c5 between the water oxygen and the non-hydrogen bonding phenylene hydrogen atom would result, and a large steric repulsion to the second network can be expected. This repulsion would be even larger for ethanol with the ethyl fragment pointing away from the copper dimer. Correspondingly, to our knowledge no indication for interpenetrated Cu-BTC is reported in the literature. The situation is different for Cu-BTB. Again, the interwoven ", "pto", " structure is the most stable in the gas phase. However, such close contacts for the axial position of the Cu-dimer are absent here, and the loss in SAS is much smaller. Thus, the interwoven Cu-BTB can be expected to be formed, which is indeed the case. With our force field it is possible to determine the energy contributions necessary to generate the interwoven MOF-14, which is depicted in Figure ", "4", ". Starting from the relaxed noninterwoven Cu-BTB net, the bowing of the trigonal BTB backbone leads to a deformed structure shown in the center of Figure ", "4", ". An energy of 16.3 kcal/mol is necessary for this deformation. As a result, half of the paddle wheel SBUs are shifted apart, whereas the other half gets closer to each other, and alternating enlarged and shrunken pores are generated. Now, by combining two such deformed nets, the final interwoven structure is generated. The stabilization in the gas phase is with \u221248.0 kcal/mol rather large, compensating the deformation energy.", "A detailed comparison of the theoretical structure, computed by a first-principles derived force field without any recourse to experimental data, shows the accuracy of the theoretical model.", "(66)", " In Figure ", "5", " a graphical overlay is shown. Note that because of the small difference in the cell parameters (X-ray diffraction, 26.948 \u00c5; force field, 26.994 \u00c5) a slight overall shift of the atoms is observed. The largest deviation is because of the shorter Cu\u2013Cu distance in theoretical structure, because of the fit to the \u201cgas-phase\u201d paddle wheel without axial ligands.", "(67)", " Apart from that the overall network structure coincides perfectly. Also the typical bending of the carboxylate with respect to the square coordination at the metal atom is well reproduced. The nonbonding C", "ph", "\u2013C", "ph", " distances of the \u03c0-stacked central aromatic rings of the two networks are very similar at 3.742 and 3.697 \u00c5 for the experimental and theoretical network, respectively. The most important measure for the deformation of the ", "pto", " network is the distances between the Cu dimer centroids. In the non-interwoven and unperturbed structure they are both exactly half the cell parameter. In the deformed structure, two centroids have to approach each other, whereas the other two are pushed apart to allow the interweaving of the networks. Again, the sum of both distances is equal to the cell spacing. In Figure ", "5", " these two critical distances are indicated by arrows. The deviation from experiment is within about 0.2 \u00c5 in the same order as the deviation in the cell parameter.

We have used our force field to design a BTB-type linker where the more open ", "tbo", " topology is preferred. To achieve this we need to introduce a steric strain to avoid the complanar conformation of the peripheral phenylene and the carboxylate group. It was shown previously that bromine ortho substitution can induce enough strain to overcome the C", "carb", "\u2013C", "ph", " conjugation and rotate the carboxylate group out of the phenyl ring plane.", "(5)", " For example, the BTC-linked copper paddle wheel system forms a 2D periodic square grid, whereas the 2-bromo-substituted BTC derivative is a 3D periodic network of ", "nbo", " topology.

Because of the strong affinity with the framework, CO2 is preferentially adsorbed over CH4 in all MOFs.  Framework catenation leads to constricted pores and addnl. adsorption sites and enhances the interaction with the adsorbate.  Therefore, catenated IRMOF-13 and PCN-6 exhibit a greater extent of adsorption, particularly for CO2, at low pressures than IRMOF-14 and PCN-6'; however, the opposite is true at high pressures. CO2/CH4 selectivity in IRMOF-1 and IRMOF-14 is almost const. at low pressures and increases with increasing pressure.  As a result of a counterbalance between energetic and entropic effects, the selectivity in IRMOF-13 initially decreases at low pressures and then increases with pressure and finally approaches a const. value.  Catenated MOFs have a higher selectivity than their noncatenated counterparts.  The presence of electrostatic interaction between CO2 and the framework increases CO2 adsorption and a corresponding decrease in CH4 adsorption and consequently enhanced selectivity.  In charged soc-MOF, the extra framework NO3- ions are identified to be equally distributed from the nearest metal atoms and vibrate around the favorable sites.  The selectivity in soc-MOF is substantially higher than in the other IRMOFs and PCNs and is the highest among various MOFs reported to date.

Both expts. and simulations show strong inflection characteristics in the adsorption isotherms.  The primary cause of the inflection is due to the strong preference for adsorption within, and in the regions close to the mouths of tetrahedral pockets.  The isotherm inflection has a significant influence on the dependence of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity, D, on the fractional occupancy, Di.  Both IRM expts. and simulations show that the Di-\u03b8i behavior appears to be influenced by the loading dependence of the inverse thermodn. factor 1/\u0393i = dln\u03b8i/dlnpi.  For nC4 and iC4, the Di increase sharply by about one order of magnitude as the occupancy \u03b8i increases from 0 to about 0.2.  This increase is caused by the fact that the diffusion characteristics undergo a transition from being dominated by hops across narrow 4.6 \u00c5 windows at low loadings to hops across large 9 \u00c5 windows for loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell.  For loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell the Di-\u03b8i dependence of nC4 and iC4 is dictated by 1/\u0393i, characteristic of more open channel structures such as FAU zeolite.

The simulations identify the octahedral cages (sites II and III) and the big cages (site I') as the preferred positions for adsorption, while site I, near the copper atoms, remains empty over the entire range of pressures analyzed due to its reduced accessibility.  The occupation of the different sites for ethane and propane in Cu-BTC proceeds similarly as for methane, and shows small differences for O2 and N2 that can be attributed to the quadrupole moment of these mols.

Indeed, we designed a new MOF using 2-butynedioate linkers that leads to an even larger NTE of 2.2% (from 0 to 500 K).  We show that this NTE behavior arises because thermal motions in the rigid Zn-O clusters and the org. moieties linking them lead to tilting of the linkers by successively larger amts. from their alignment along the unit cell axes, resulting in decreased cell parameters.  The MOF materials were developed to provide a large reversible hydrogen-storage capacity leading to as much as 73% free vol.  However, the NTE properties suggest other possible applications.  Thus, their porous but constrained three-dimensional framework provides a framework onto which other materials might blend to form composites with negligible vol. change with temp.

The computational prediction of hybrid org.-inorg. extended lattices is presented.  The prodn. of candidate crystal structures is successfully performed by direct-space assembly of building-units using the AASBU (automated assembly of secondary building units) method, mixing independent org. and inorg. units.  Hybrid candidates that are compatible with the imposed metal:org. ratio are generated with their cell parameters, space group, at. positions, along with their simulated diffraction pattern.  Since no explicit limit regarding the nature, no., and size of the inorg. and org. units, or hybrid building-block is involved, the method offers boundless potential for exploring hybrid frameworks in terms of the topol. diversity.  The most appealing development arises from the computer-assisted design of hybrid frameworks.  Indeed, in a significant no. of systems, it is known that controlled synthesis conditions can promote the occurrence of specific building-units, which serve to propagate the infinite crystal structure.  It is believed that the computational approach presented is valuable to create virtual libraries of viable hybrid polymorphs.  Further it proved to be, for the 1st time in the realm of hybrids, a tangible route towards structure soln. in direct space, exemplified here with the computational structure detn. of two complex hybrid structures, MIL-100 and MIL-101.  This challenging area is of special interest when high quality diffraction data are not available or when very large cell sizes are involved.

The resulting, well-converged DFT value (LDA-GGA av.) for E is 21.6 \u00b1 0.3 GPa, with C11 = 0.28 \u00b1 0.01 GPa, C12 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.01 GPa, and C44 = 0.03 \u00b1 0.02 GPa.  Correcting the measured modulus for the highly anisotropic elastic behavior predicted by DFT suggests an effective modulus for the (100) face of 7.9 GPa.  The DFT prediction is expected to be reliable here.  Therefore, the lower measured Young's modulus is most likely due to an interesting behavior during fractureless plastic deformation that occurs in these framework materials.  Deformation or buckling in this nanoporous structure likely leads to structural changes at the lowest loads the authors can apply in the expt.  This appears to be a unique property of MOFs, where the elastic properties of the plastically deformed materials behave differently than those for more traditional nanoporous metals, ceramics, and polymers.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXhsVant77J&md5=71193221b124f3d4666a7c1f4c7a674c", "37.

It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies.  This study also outlines the methodol. employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and exptl. data.  Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in mol.-dynamics simulations.  Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small mols. in a combined \"org./protein\" force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biol. significance.  A second distinguishing feature is that the core protion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data-ca. 500 mol. structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31* structures evaluated at a defined approxn. to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level.  A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chem. systems of interest to org. and combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful exptl. data are available.  The methodol. used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature.  Rather than using the common \"functional group\" approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been detd. in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data.  MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well.  In addn., MMFF94 reproduces exptl. bond lengths (0.014 \u00c5 root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2\u00b0 rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm-1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems.

(Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.

There have been more than 1500 publications since the mid-1990s, on combined QM-MM methodologies.  Limitations in current models include the distortional characteristics of force field potential terms, the smooth transit from one potential surface to another, rather than surface hopping, and the blending of electrostatics between QM and MM portions of a QM-MM model.  Functional forms, potential surface coupling terms, and parameterization strategies for the Approx. Pair Theory (APT), a next generation reactive force field model, are described.  The APT model has been developed to correct a no. of limitations in current reactive force field models as well as providing a foundation for a next generation QM-MM model.  Chem. bonding concepts are used to develop fully dissociative bond stretch, bend, torsion, and inversion valence terms.  Quantum mechanics also provides functional forms for potential surface coupling terms that permit a general description of reactivity from hydrogen bonding, through non-classical carbocations and cracking, to olefin polymn., oxidn., and metathesis.

The aim of the present paper is to present an anal. that combines both effects in a quant. manner.  The result is that both processes are present in both stabilizing and destabilizing interactions and neither can be ignored.  Excluded vol. was estd. using accessible surface area calcns. of the kind introduced by Lee and Richards.  The change in excluded vol. on unfolding, \u0394X, is quite large.  For example, \u0394X for RNase is 6.7 L in urea and \u223c16 L in sucrose.  The latter no. is greater than the molar volume of the protein.  Direct interaction with the protein is represented as the solvent exchange mechanism, which differs from ordinary assocn. theory because of the weakness of the interaction and the high concns. of cosolvents.  The balance between the two effects and their contribution to overall stability are most simply presented as bar diagrams.  Our finding for five proteins is that excluded vol. contributes to the stabilization of the native structure and that contact interaction contributes to destabilization.  This is true for five proteins and four cosolvents including both denaturants and osmolytes.  Whether a substance stabilizes a protein or destabilizes it depends on the relative size of these two contributions.  The const. for the cosolvent contact with the protein is remarkably uniform for four of the proteins, indicating a similarity of groups exposed during unfolding.  One protein, staphylococcus nuclease, is anomalous in almost all respects.  In general, the strength of the interaction with guanidinium is about twice that of urea, which is about twice that of trimethylamine-N-oxide and sucrose.  Arguments are presented for the use of vol. fractions in equil. equations and the ignoring of activity coeffs. of the cosolvent.

The dehydration process preserves the cryst. nature of the material, just causing a redn. of the cell vol. due to the shrinking of the [Cu2C4O8] cage.  The removal of adsorbed H2O mol. makes the framework Cu(II) sites available for interaction with other probe mols.  In situ IR spectroscopy has evidenced the formation at liq. nitrogen temp. of labile Cu(II)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CO adducts characterized by a ~\u03bd(C-O) = 2178 cm-1 and at 15 K of Cu(II)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H2 adducts characterized by a ~\u03bd(H-H) = 4100 cm-1.  To the best of our knowledge, we have obsd. for the first time a clear signal of Cu(II) carbonyl and dihydrogen complexes formed inside a cryst. microporous hosting matrix.  The sinking of the oxygens of the carboxyl units, undergone by the Cu(II) framework ions in the dehydration process, is responsible for the rather low coordinative unsatn. of Cu(II).  The important shielding effect of the four oxygen framework atoms is testified by the low polarization factor of the Cu(II) site probed by both CO and H2 mols.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XptFWhsw%253D%253D&md5=0489e2793da5d68f5ad8fd57124a866d", "68.
