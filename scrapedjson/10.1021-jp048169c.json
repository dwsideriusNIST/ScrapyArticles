The nanotube samples have pore volumes comparable to that of CA1. The activated carbon CA2 has a pore volume more important (1.01 mL/g) than that of CA1 (0.47 mL/g) probably due to a structure associated with its large specific surface area.

The previous discussion has established that these values of mwt % do not truly correspond to large storage efficiency measured in wt %.

Dillon et al", ".", "32", " and Hircher et al.", "28", " have measured the hydrogen adsorption capacity of SWNT samples (given in Table 2) which have the same order of magnitude as that which we have obtained in our experiments by using mwt %, but a complete comparison is not possible since a detailed description of the experimental apparatus is not given in these articles. The present analysis of the adsorption capacity of activated carbon and SWNT samples has been made with the main aim of giving a realistic estimate of the storage efficiency of hydrogen in these adsorbents. In the presence of an adsorbent in a container obviously reducing the volume available to store hydrogen, the considered estimate wt % allows to determine when the excess adsorption resulting from hydrogen\u2212adsorbent interaction is able to compensate for this loss. A detailed discussion of the storage efficiency of SWNT adsorbent models has been made in ref 43 at the temperatures of 293, 150, and 77 K.

Recent expts. and numerical simulations have shown that adsorbent materials appropriate to H2 storage could be made up of carbon nanotubes.  In this work the properties of such materials were studied.  By Monte Carlo simulations, the H2 adsorption in 2 arrangements of opened single-walled carbon nanotubes at a temp. of 77 K and pressures \u226415 MPa were studied.  A quant. comparison is made between simulation data and exptl. results.

Compared to a typical gasoline tank, this would correspond to a hydrogen d. of 65 kg/m3 (including the storage system) and 6.5 wt%.  Presently, only liq. hydrogen (LH2) systems with a d. of 51 kg/m3 and 14 wt% is close to this target.  However, LH2 is costly and requires more complex refueling systems.

We present the results of a parametric and comparative study of adsorption and compressed gas storage of hydrogen as a function of temp., pressure and adsorbent properties.
