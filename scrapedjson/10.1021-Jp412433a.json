During this full relaxation, in the case of both Al- and Ga-MIL-53, we observed the linkers to untwist, moving in a way that the metal center could regain its undistorted octahedral coordination. This relaxation, corresponding to the energetic penalty for the distorted \u201cnarrow-pore\u201d conformation of the metal coordination, corresponded to a change in energy of 97.3 kJ/mol for Al, and 87.8 kJ/mol for Ga. From this, we conclude that the energetic penalty for the distortion of the Ga coordination is smaller than it is for Al, because of its more diffuse orbitals.", "Thus, the more diffuse orbitals of Ga compared to Al is the reason behind the higher stability of its np phase, and thus the reason why Ga-MIL-53 is in np phase at room temperature (rather than lp for Al-MIL-53). The more diffuse nature of the Ga orbitals also means that its coordination sphere can deform more, thus allowing the benzene linkers to get closer in Ga-MIL-53 than Al-MIL-53.

Regarding the MOF type MIL-53(Cr), the situation becomes more complex due to the breathing of its structure upon water adsorption that induces a structural transition between a narrow pore (NP) and a large pore (LP) forms.  The resulting shrinkage/reopening of the framework leads to crucial modifications of the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity character of the material.  A combination of mol. simulations (Grand Canonical Monte Carlo and mol. dynamics) and exptl. techniques (quasi-elastic neutron scattering and gravimetry/volumetry) allows a complete elucidation of the adsorption and diffusion mechanisms in play in this structure.  It also provides a microscopic explanation of the hydrophilic and mildly hydrophobic behaviors of the NP and LP forms resp.  The arrangements of water within the two porosities are then discussed and compared to those usually obsd. for the liq. state.  Furthermore, the self-diffusivity for water in these two structural forms significantly differs both in magnitude and mechanism with a normal and single file one-dimensional diffusion mechanisms in the LP and NP forms, resp.  Indeed, this anomalous behavior of the MIL-53(Cr) upon water adsorption implies a strong modification of its hydrophilic/hydrophobic character.

The resulting structures enabled the structure detn. of the two CO2-contg. intermediate and large-pore phases obsd. by exptl. synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies with increasing CO2 pressure; this would not have been possible for the intermediate structure via conventional methods because of diffraction peak broadening.

It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6\u00b7R-6.  A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common d. functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported.  The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on std. thermochem. benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked arom. mols. and group II element clusters, and for the computation of mol. geometries.  Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for std. functionals.  In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean abs. deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1.  The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the av. CCSD(T) accuracy.  The basic strategy in the development to restrict the d. functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interat. distances by damped C6\u00b7R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions.  As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference.  From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chem. method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XhtFenu7bO&md5=0b4aa16bebc3a0a2ec175d4b161ab0e4", "26.
