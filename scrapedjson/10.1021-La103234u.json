In the case of both pharmaceuticals, HKUST-1 adsorbed <1 mg/g sorbent over the entire concentration range investigated. PXRD of the HKUST-1 after the adsorption experiment showed a change in diffraction pattern comparable to those shown above for activated HKUST-1 in water. This indicates that HKUST-1, although displaying some structural stability in pure water, is not a suitable MCP for use in aqueous phase applications. However, MIL-100 exhibits excellent capacities for these two pharmaceuticals with a furosemide capacity of 11.8 mg furosemide/g MIL-100 at a concentration of 7.50 \u03bcg/mL water and a sulfasalazine capacity of 6.2 mg sulfasalazine/g MIL-100 at a concentration of 1.40 \u03bcg/mL. Additionally, PXRD of the MIL-100 after adsorption indicated no change in the structure after exposure to water. For comparison, a common zeolite, Na(Y), was also studied and was found to adsorb no furosemide or sulfasalazine over the concentration range investigated. MIL-100 has the ability to remove large amounts of these compounds even at incredibly low concentrations indicating that it is a potential candidate for use in purification of drinking water where pharmaceuticals have been detected. Particularly, the sulfasalazine adsorption isotherm displays a fairly steep initial rise indicating that MIL-100 is capable of adsorbing trace amounts of this compound from water, a relevant finding for water treatment. These results from model experiments demonstrate that MCPs are promising materials for the adsorption of pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions; however, real world water matrices will require further validation.

Its 3 D framework is built up of infinite trans chains of corner-sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra.

The exptl. steaming method allows for high throughput screening of materials stability over a broad range of steam levels as well as in-depth investigation of structural transformations under more highly resolved conditions, while the cluster model presented here yields the correct trends in hydrothermal stability.  Good agreement was obsd. between predicted relative stabilities of materials by mol. modeling and exptl. results.  Fundamental information from these studies has provided insight into how metal compn. and coordination, chem. functionality of org. linker, framework dimensionality, and interpenetration affect the relative stabilities of PCP materials.  This work suggests that the strength of the bond between the metal oxide cluster and the bridging linker is important in detg. the hydrothermal stability of the PCP.  Although the flexibility of the framework plays a role, it is not as important as the metal-linker bond strength.

While sulfonamides can easily be detd. in pure water, wastewater influent and effluent collected from sewage treatment plants in Burlington and Toronto (Ontario) were found to generate confounding matrix effects.  In an effort to overcome these matrix effects, we developed a solid phase microextn. (SPME) method to det. sulfonamides.  Of the five different fiber assemblies investigated, the carbowax/divinylbenzene (CW/DVB) fiber produced the optimal response to sulfonamides.  The SPME method was further optimized for sorption time (20 min), soln. salinity (10%, w/v, KCl), pH (4.5), and static desorption time (30 min).  When compared to solid phase extn. (SPE) using MCX cartridges, we obsd. that despite having higher MDLs and poorer sensitivity, SPME possessed the advantage of speed and reduced solvent usage.  Most importantly, in contrast to SPE, when we applied the SPME method to fortified wastewater samples, we were generally able to accurately det. (i.e., recover) those sulfonamides that were present.

This group comprises 38 pharmaceuticals and 10 of their most frequent metabolites, 6 pesticides, and 2 disinfectants.  The LC-MS methodology applied is based in the use of a hybrid triple-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (QTRAP) in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS).  The join application of both techniques provided very good results in terms of accurate quantification and unequivocal confirmation.  Quantification was performed by LC-QTRAP-MS operating under selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode in both positive and negative electrospray ionization.  Unequivocal identification was provided by the acquisition of three SRM transitions per compound in most of the cases and by LC-TOF-MS analysis, which allows obtaining accurate mass measurements of the identified compounds with errors lower than 2 ppm.  Additionally, the use of TOF-MS permits retrospective analysis, since the full spectrum is recorded at all times with a high sensitivity.  Thus, review of recorded chromatograms looking for new compounds or transformation products suspected to be present in the samples is feasible allowing one to increase the scope of the method along the monitoring program.  The analytical performance of the quantitative LC-QTRAP-MS method was evaluated in effluent wastewater samples.  Linearity of response over 3 orders of magnitude was demonstrated for most compounds (R(2) > 0.99).  Method limits of detection were between 0.04 and 50 ng L(-1).  Finally, the methodology was successfully applied to a monitoring study intended to characterize wastewater effluents of six sewage treatment plants in Spain.

Each sample was analyzed for 106 org. wastewater-related contaminants (OWC) representing a diverse group of extensively used chems.  Forty OWC were detected in \u22651 stream water or raw water supply samples at the treatment facility; 34 were detected in >10% of these samples.  Several compds. were also frequently detected in finished water samples.  These compds. included prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, fragrance compds., flame retardants and plasticizers, cosmetic compds., and a solvent.  Detection of these compds. suggested they resist removal through conventional water treatment processes.  Other compds. frequently detected in stream water and the raw water supply were not detected in finished water samples, including prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, disinfectants, detergent metabolites, and plant and animal steroids.  Non-detection of these compds. indicated their concns. are reduced to levels less than anal. detection limits o they are transformed to degradates through conventional DWT processes.  OWC concns. in finished water generally were low and did not exceed Federal drinking water stds. or lifetime health advisories, although stds. or advisories have not been established for most of these compds.  At least 11 and as many as 17 OWC were detected in finished water.  Drinking water criteria currently are based on toxicity of individual compds. and not combinations of compds.  Little is known about potential human health effects assocd. with chronic exposure to trace concns. of multiple OWC through routes such as drinking water.  Their occurrence in drinking water analyzed in this study is unregulated; most compds. have not been routinely monitored in source- or potable-water supplies.  This study provided initial documentation that many of these compds. can survive conventional water treatment processes and occur in potable water supplies.  It provided information that can be used in establishing research and regulatory priorities and in designing future monitoring programs.  Results also indicated that improvements in water treatment processes may benefit by considering the response of OWC and other trace org. pollutants to specific phys. and chem. treatment processes.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2cXlvVWmt7w%253D&md5=2ca411755d9d8ad049257dd8c4f60a9d", "29.

The focal point of this report is the pitfalls related to the MOF-5 phase identification based on powder XRD data.  A broad set of conditions and procedures have been reported for MOF-5 synthesis.  These variations have led to materials with substantially different adsorption properties (sp. surface areas in the range 700 to 3400 m2/g).  The relatively low wt. loss obsd. for some as synthesized samples upon solvent removal is also indicative of a low pore vol.  Regrettably, these materials have all been described as MOF-5 without any further comments.  Furthermore, the reported powder XRD patterns hint at structural differences: The variations in surface area are accompanied by peak splitting phenomena and rather pronounced changes in the relative peak intensities in the powder XRD patterns.  In this work, we use single-crystal XRD to investigate structural differences between low and high surface area MOF-5.  The low surface area MOF-5 sample had two different classes of crystals.  For the dominant phase, Zn(OH)2 species partly occupied the cavities.  The presence of Zn species makes the hosting cavity and possibly also adjacent cavities inaccessible and thus efficiently reduces the pore vol. of the material.  Furthermore, the minor phase consisted of doubly interpenetrated MOF-5 networks, which lowers the adsorption capacity.  The presence of Zn species and lattice interpenetration changes the symmetry from cubic to trigonal and explains the peak splitting obsd. in the powder XRD patterns.  Pore-filling effects from the Zn species (and partly the solvent mols.) are also responsible for the pronounced variations in powder XRD peak intensities.  This latter conclusion is particularly useful for predicting the adsorption properties of a MOF-5-type material from powder XRD.  Crystal structure of the above compd. has been described.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXisFeisr0%253D&md5=fe529270152930eabdb912a192c32666"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0013.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2010/langd5.2010.26.issue-22/la103234u/production/images/small/la-2010-03234u_0011.gif\">"]}
