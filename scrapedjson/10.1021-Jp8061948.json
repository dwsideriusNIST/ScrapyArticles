This polymorphic form has been investigated by means of molecular mechanics calculations using an accurate MM3 type force field. In the case of the parent structure IRMOF-1, the regular form is more stable by 17.8 kcal/mol (per formula unit) than this isomer. However, due to steric repulsions, in the case of the naphthalene and anthracene based IRMOF-7 and 993, this is reduced to only 2.0 and 5.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Due to a complex network of interlinker interactions, a broad variety of different rotational isomers is predicted, and only by using a genetic algorithm search algorithm the global minimum structure could be located. The low energy difference between the isomeric forms explains the disorder observed for IRMOF-7 experimentally.

Different annealing protocols were not found to be able to locate the global minimum structure within a reasonable time. Unfortunately it is not possible to asses the relative stability of the isomeric structures without knowledge about the individual global minima. As a consequence, we implemented a genetic algorithm strategy for this purpose, which was found to be very efficient for global optimization problems in various fields.", "(68)", " In principle, any efficient phase space sampling technique could be used here. However, since a time-consuming total energy optimization is needed for each configuration, an intelligent bias of the search as in the case of a GA is advisable. We found the GA approach particularly successful in this case.", " ", "We used the orientation of the linker plane with respect to the linker axis as the \u201cgene\u201d for encoding the structure of a specific conformation. Because of the energy minimum in the rotational profile between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 (see Figure ", "4", "), there are overall four possible orientations for each linker, encoded by the integers [0, 1, 2, 3] in case of IRMOF-7 (see Figure ", "5", "). In IRMOF-993, two conformations are identical due to the symmetry of the anthracene unit, and just a binary gene ([0, 1]) is needed to encode a single linker. Since we did not impose any symmetry constraints and there are 24 independent linkers in the periodic unit cell, a \u201cchromosome\u201d of 24 genes encodes the full structure. An \u201cindividual\u201d is defined by a specific chromosome, which serves as a blueprint to generate an idealized initial 3D structure. This is then optimized to obtain a final potential energy, which serves as a fitness criterion, and determines whether the individual is kept for the next optimization cycle (generation). The data flow for this process is shown schematically in Figure ", "6", ". In the first generation, the chromosomes are initialized randomly, whereas later they are generated by crossing over and mutating chromosomes of the previous generations. It should be noted that, due to the high symmetry of the network, different chromosomes can represent an identical structure. We did, however, not exclude the redundant chromosomes by symmetry constraints since they did not hamper convergence but helped to maintain diversity in the population. With this approach, we observed a much more rapid convergence of the energy compared to any of the annealing schemes. Despite that, the optimization process sometimes stalled because of a depletion of diversity. In this case, the GA was restarted, reusing the best candidates and filling the population with randomized individuals. After a number of restarts and about 300 cycles for IRMOF-7 and about 200 for IRMOF-993, this process converged to a relatively high symmetry structure, which is discussed in detail below. It must be pointed out that our approach does of course not guarantee to give the global minimum of the system. However, a number of independent restarts did not result in any further improvement for a large number of generations, and we are thus confident to have located the global minimum structure. Note also that in principle a larger unit cell with more individual linkers would allow for further conformations, not possible in our periodic model. Because of the symmetry of the global minimum structure for both IRMOF-7 and 993 and the nature of the interlinker interaction, this does, however, not affect the nature of the global minimum.", " ", " ", "Figure 5.

The generation of metal-org. framework (MOF) coordination polymers enables the tailoring of novel solids with regular porosity from the micro to nanopore scale.  Since the discovery of this new family of nanoporous materials and the concept of so called 'reticular design', nowadays several hundred different types of MOF are known.  The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centers, linked together with a variety of polyat. org. bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mech. stability.  Describing examples of different Zn-contg. structures, e.g. MOF-2, MOF-5 and IRMOF-8 verified synthesis methods will be given, as well as a totally novel electrochem. approach for transition metal based MOFs will be presented for the 1st time.  With sufficient amts. of sample now being available, the testing of metal-org. frameworks in fields of catalysis and gas processing is exemplified.  Report is given on the catalytic activation of alkynes (formation of methoxypropene from propyne, vinylester synthesis from acetylene).  Removal of impurities in natural gas (traces of tetrahydrothiophene in methane), pressure swing sepn. of rare gases (Kr and Xe) and storage of H (3.3% at 2.0 MPa/77 K on Cu-BTC-MOF) will underline the prospective future industrial use of metal-org. frameworks in gas processing.

The focal point of this report is the pitfalls related to the MOF-5 phase identification based on powder XRD data.  A broad set of conditions and procedures have been reported for MOF-5 synthesis.  These variations have led to materials with substantially different adsorption properties (sp. surface areas in the range 700 to 3400 m2/g).  The relatively low wt. loss obsd. for some as synthesized samples upon solvent removal is also indicative of a low pore vol.  Regrettably, these materials have all been described as MOF-5 without any further comments.  Furthermore, the reported powder XRD patterns hint at structural differences: The variations in surface area are accompanied by peak splitting phenomena and rather pronounced changes in the relative peak intensities in the powder XRD patterns.  In this work, we use single-crystal XRD to investigate structural differences between low and high surface area MOF-5.  The low surface area MOF-5 sample had two different classes of crystals.  For the dominant phase, Zn(OH)2 species partly occupied the cavities.  The presence of Zn species makes the hosting cavity and possibly also adjacent cavities inaccessible and thus efficiently reduces the pore vol. of the material.  Furthermore, the minor phase consisted of doubly interpenetrated MOF-5 networks, which lowers the adsorption capacity.  The presence of Zn species and lattice interpenetration changes the symmetry from cubic to trigonal and explains the peak splitting obsd. in the powder XRD patterns.  Pore-filling effects from the Zn species (and partly the solvent mols.) are also responsible for the pronounced variations in powder XRD peak intensities.  This latter conclusion is particularly useful for predicting the adsorption properties of a MOF-5-type material from powder XRD.

The storage capacity of hydrogen of MOF-505 at room temp. and moderate pressures is predicted to be low, in agreement with the outcome for hydrogen physisorption in other porous materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXhtlarsL%252FJ&md5=2d70ee7245ea1f739dff451d3640f16f", " ", "35.

In this force field, only nonbonded parameters are used to describe Zn-O interactions.  The CVFF force field was used with slight modifications to describe the benzene dicarboxylate linker.  The force field correctly predicts a wide range of structural properties of this MOF, including a neg. thermal expansion of approx. 1% at 30 and 293 K, in agreement with both theory and expt.  Compressibility results and the assocd. elastic moduli are in also good agreement with published d. functional theory calcns. and nanoindentation expts.  The force field predicts a decrease in elastic moduli as temp. increases, which would greatly affect the mech. properties of MOFs.  Calcd. vibrational frequencies for Zn-O modes agree with expt., and a low-frequency mode representing a 180\u00b0 rotation of the Ph groups is seen.  This rotation becomes more prevalent as the temp. is increased from 300 to 400 K, in agreement with NMR data.  Simulations were also carried out with adsorbed guests, including ethanol, cyclohexane, and several chloromethanes.  It is shown that the IRMOF-1 lattice parameter depends on the nature of the guest-framework interaction; strongly hydrophilic guests, such as ethanol, cause a decrease (-0.9%) in unit cell vol., while hydrophobic guests cause an increase (0.7-1.5%) in unit cell vol.  The calcd. free vols. in IRMOF-1 range from 53.5% to 56.0%, in good agreement with expt.  Finally, the activation energy for benzene self-diffusion calcd. at low loadings is in good agreement with previous simulations and NMR results, but the magnitude of the diffusion const. is underestimated, most likely because of deficiencies in the CVFF portion of the force field.  The results demonstrate, however, that employing a rigid force field results in much poorer agreement with exptl. data.

As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy was described by damped interat. potentials of the form C6R-6.  The use of pure, gradient-cor. d. functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resoln.-of-the-identity (RI) approxn. for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems.  In contrast to the previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality were employed, which reduced the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend.  By using a global scaling factor for the at. C6 coeffs., the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced.  The \"double counting\" of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes was found to be insignificant if steep damping functions were employed.  The method was applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small mols. (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene\u00b7H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC).  In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theor. or exptl. results for binding energies and intermol. distances is obtained.  For stacked arom. systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to std. MP2 treatments that systematically over-bind.  The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chem.
