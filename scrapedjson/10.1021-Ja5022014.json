In this case, the dynamic movement of water between the O(10) and O(10)\u2032 is needed for proton transfer along the 1-D channels.

The additional water molecule in ", "1\u00b73H", "2", "O", " (O(9) or O(10)) was located next to the adp molecules, and could form hydrogen bonds with them, which implies that the dissociation of protons from adp to water molecules is more likely to occur in ", "1\u00b73H", "2", "O", " than in ", "1\u00b72H", "2", "O", ".", "Figure 8.

The present microwave response is not attributed to proton conductions but to some rotational or vibrational motions of molecules embedded in the framework.
