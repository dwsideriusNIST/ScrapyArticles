All coals exhibited a certain moisture content beyond which further moisture did not affect the sorption capacity.  This limiting moisture content was dependent on the rank of the coal and the sorbate gas and, for these coals, corresponded approx. to the equil. moisture content that would be attained by exposing the coal to \u223c40-80% relative humidity.

The model was developed within a rigorous theor. framework based on a local-d. formulation.  Specifically, we have utilized the simplified local-d./Peng-Robinson (SLD-PR) model and generalized it in terms of coal characterization information available from ultimate and proximate analyses of the coals.  The newly developed generalized model is capable of predicting the adsorption of pure and mixed gases on coals within three times the expected exptl. uncertainties, on av.  The model was further validated by comparison with an external data set comprised of CO2 adsorption isotherms on 27 diverse coals.  Results indicate that, on av., the SLD-PR generalized model provided a priori predictions of the CO2 adsorption data on the 27 coals with an av. abs. percent deviation of 12%, based solely on coal characterization information for these coals.

Currently, two volumetric methods are widely used to measure supercrit. gas adsorption on heterogeneous matrixes such as activated carbon and coal.

All three coals showed similar behavior, with swelling increasing as a function of pressure up to \u223c8 to 10 MPa, after which no further increase in swelling was obsd.  The max. volumetric swelling was between \u223c1.7 and 1.9%, even in liq. CO2.  Significant anisotropy was obsd.; swelling in the plane perpendicular to the bedding plane was always substantially higher than in the parallel plane.  The swelling in these coals was completely reversible with each sample returning to its original dimensions after the gas was removed, even after multiple exposures.  Temp. did not directly affect the max. amt. of swelling, however, the swelling tended to occur at lower pressures with decreasing temp.  Expressing the swelling as a function of gas d. rather than gas pressure showed that swelling was independent of temp.; in all cases the swelling curves were identical.  Swelling could be well represented by a modified Dubinin-Radushkevich model which was used previously to describe gas adsorption on coal.  Volumetric swelling data for two of the coals were combined with gas adsorption results previously measured for these coals.  Swelling was roughly proportional to the amt. of CO2 adsorbed up to intermediate pressures, but at high pressures, the relation was no longer linear; adsorption continued to increase but swelling did not.  The swelling data were used to correct the adsorption isotherm measured for these coals, assuming that the vol. occupied by the coal was inaccessible to gas and increased in proportion to volumetric swelling.  At pressures up to \u223c5 MPa, the effect of correction for swelling on the adsorption value was negligible but at higher pressures, the vol. changes due to the swelling of the coal resulted in an increased measured excess adsorption.  At 15 MPa the cor. excess sorption was \u223c30% greater than the uncorrected value.  Correction for swelling had little effect on the calcd. sorption capacity of the coal or the heat of sorption (using the modified Dubinin-Radushkevich equation) but had strong effects on the term representing dissoln. of carbon dioxide into the coal.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhs1Krtrc%253D&md5=3a916bfde88021a560fe8784c79fc1bd", "26.

The adsorption of water vapor and carbon dioxide increased in proportion to the square root of the carboxyl group concn., regardless of the partial pressure or the gas species.  Assuming functional group adsorption sites to be present on the surfaces of hydrophobic matrixes and adsorption to occur in a liq.-like closed packed state, the adsorption on coal was detd. based on the carboxyl group concn. on the coal surface, the mol. cross section and the mol. wt. of the adsorbate.  The surface area did not depend on the type of adsorbate, as was obsd. for water vapor and carbon dioxide adsorption on coal.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXovV2rtw%253D%253D&md5=94603f073a4a95179b2972a1d01c0f27"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/enfuem/2012/enfuem.2012.26.issue-1/ef201393p/production/images/small/ef-2011-01393p_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/enfuem/2012/enfuem.2012.26.issue-1/ef201393p/production/images/small/ef-2011-01393p_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/enfuem/2012/enfuem.2012.26.issue-1/ef201393p/production/images/small/ef-2011-01393p_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/enfuem/2012/enfuem.2012.26.issue-1/ef201393p/production/images/small/ef-2011-01393p_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/enfuem/2012/enfuem.2012.26.issue-1/ef201393p/production/images/small/ef-2011-01393p_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/enfuem/2012/enfuem.2012.26.issue-1/ef201393p/production/images/small/ef-2011-01393p_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/enfuem/2012/enfuem.2012.26.issue-1/ef201393p/production/images/small/ef-2011-01393p_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/enfuem/2012/enfuem.2012.26.issue-1/ef201393p/production/images/small/ef-2011-01393p_0006.gif\">"]}
