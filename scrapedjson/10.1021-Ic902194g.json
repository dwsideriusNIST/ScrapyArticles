A striking feature is that the structure adopted by a given ZIF is detd. by link-link interactions, rather than by the structure directing agents used in zeolite synthesis.  As a result, systematic variations of linker substituents have yielded many different ZIFs that exhibit known or predicted zeolite topologies and the materials are chem. and thermally stable, yet have the long-sought-after design flexibility offered by functionalized org. links and a high d. of transition metal ions.  The authors report the synthesis and characterization of two porous ZIFs, ZIF-95 and ZIF-100 with structures of a scale and complexity previously unknown in zeolites.  The materials have complex cages that contain up to 264 vertexes, and are constructed from as many as 7,524 atoms.  As expected from the adsorption selectivity recently documented for other members of this materials family, both ZIFs selectively capture CO2 from several different gas mixts. at room temp., with ZIF-100 capable of storing 28 L per L of material at std. temp. and pressure.  These characteristics, combined with their high thermal and chem. stability and ease of fabrication, make ZIFs promising candidate materials for strategies aimed at ameliorating increasing atm.

Also, the heptametallic SBUs are interconnected by PDA acting as linkers, thereby generating an extended network with a three-dimensional, noninterpenetrating, intersecting large-channel system with spacing of \u223c17.3 \u00c5.  As a microporous framework, polymer 1 shows adsorption behavior that is favorable towards H2O and CH3OH, and substantial H2 uptake.

So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.
