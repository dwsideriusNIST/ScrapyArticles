This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

Although these routes are convenient, it remains difficult to find suitable reaction conditions or to control the outcome of the assembly process.

The introduction of linkers with different properties from those of the initial metal-org. polyhedra can thus lead to new metal-org. polyhedra with distinct properties (including size and shape).
