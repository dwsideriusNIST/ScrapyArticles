Measurements of CO2 show a steady increase over the past 30 years caused by the burning of fossil fuels and from the loss of natural CO2 sinks.  A 100-year increase in global temperature by 0.3 to 0.6 degrees C is reflected in atmospheric warming, glacier shrinkage, and rising sea levels.  OBJECTIVES:  Planetary ecosystem dynamics are being altered, challenging public health.  It is predicted that morbidity and mortality will increase as a result of heat stress, as seen in recent heat waves in the U.S.  Weather disaster effects will increase in number and magnitude, and both noninfectious and infectious diseases may flourish.  A significant challenge will be the changes in life cycles of microbial species due to the warmer environs.  Specific increases in incidence have been noted for vector-borne diseases, in addition to pulmonary findings, cardiovascular morbidity, neurological diseases, and occupational diseases.  CONCLUSIONS:  Warming can be demonstrated by the observed changes that have already occurred in the environment, particularly the thinning of polar ice caps.  The United States Global Research Program has been established to coordinate research activities, which responds to issues deemed important by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Research issues pertain to the scientific uncertainties in the greenhouse effect, temperature measurements at various atmospheric levels and latitudes, and impact on biota redistribution.  The Kyoto Protocol has mandated specific solutions, e.g., a 7% reduction in CO2 levels within 10 years.  Future recommendations involve supporting new technologies that are available to decrease emissions as well as understanding the role that occupational and environmental specialists have in global warming recognition.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD3Mvks1Wjug%253D%253D&md5=3dc75ef861c264fb6a1d48d58bfe375f", "3.

They were shown to be effective and stable low temp. adsorbent materials that could make them potentially useful for gas storage and sepn. of various gas mixts.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas and CO2 levels in the atm. have been steadily increasing due to human activity.  Hence, capturing CO2 is an active research area.  Previous studies on CO2 adsorption using CNTs focused on low concn. CO2 environments; however, capturing CO2 at the source (coal plants, automobile emissions, etc.) is a more realistic soln., therefore, in the current study, the potential use of CNTs as CO2 adsorbents at high concn. CO2 environments is reported.  The effects of single walled carbon nanotube diam. and length, and CO2 concn. were studied using mol. dynamics simulations at 300 and 320 K.  Results showed that CO2 mols. were selectively adsorbed by the single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), and adsorption was dependent on both the internal vol. of the nanotube and the cross-sectional area of the tube entrance.  Temp. increase had a substantial impact on the location of CO2 mols. in and around the nanotube, i.e., at 300 K, CO2 mols. were located both inside and on the nanotube surface; whereas at 320 K, the CO2 mols. were mostly inside the nanotube.  This result suggests that the mechanism of CO2 adsorption and retention can be controlled by temp.  Finally, our results showed that although the amt. of adsorbed CO2 increased with increasing CO2 concn., the efficiency of adsorption increased with decreasing CO2 concn.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xhs1eks7nI&md5=cf38c10ecc667cdc72a39bd21bb91fe3", "12.

To provide deep insight into the effect of pore width, temp., pressure and bulk compn. on the adsorption behavior of CO2 /N2 mixts., 5 different CNTs [(6,6), (7,7), (8,8), (9,9), and (10,10) CNT] with diams. ranging from 0.807 to 1.35 nm, 3 temps.

The results from all the simulation conditions investigated in this work show that CNTs preferentially adsorb CO2 relative to N2 in a binary mixt.  The results are consistent with the hypothesis that stronger interaction of one component with the nanotube surface results in a higher adsorption capacity compared to the other component.  An optimized pore size of D = 8.07 nm corresponding to (6, 6) CNT, at T = 300 K and P = 0.15 MPa at a bulk mole compn. of yCO2 =0.3 was identified in which carbon nanotubes demonstrate the greatest selectivity for sepn. of CO2 relative to N2.  In addn., it is worth pointing out that, under similar simulation conditions, CNTs exhibit higher selectivity compared to other carbon-based materials [carbon membrane polyimide (PI) and PI/multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)] for CO2 adsorption.  As a prototype, the selectivity of an equimolar mixt. of CO2/N2 for adsorption on (6, 6) CNTs at 300 K and 0.15 MPa reaches 9.68, which is considerably larger than that reported in carbon membrane.

Except mol. H2, all studied nonpolar adsorbates assemble into single-file chain structures inside DWNTs at operating pressures <1 MPa.  Mol. wires of adsorbed mols. are stabilized by the strong solid-fluid potential generated from the cylindrical C walls.

A modified Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) adsorption model was found to fit the exptl. data under all conditions.  Moisture adsorption isotherms of these coals were measured at 21\u00b0.  The Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model was capable of accurately representing the moisture isotherms over the full range of relative pressures.  Moist coal had a significantly lower max. sorption capacity for both CO2 and CH4 than dry coal.  However, the extent to which the capacity was reduced was dependent upon the rank of the coal.  Higher rank coals were less affected by the presence of moisture than low rank coals.  All coals exhibited a certain moisture content beyond which further moisture did not affect the sorption capacity.  This limiting moisture content was dependent on the rank of the coal and the sorbate gas and, for these coals, corresponded approx. to the equil. moisture content that would be attained by exposing the coal to \u223c40-80% relative humidity.

When this window size is large enough for the formation of a stable water cluster, condensation in a small pore induces the filling of empty large connected pores.

Conventional amine technologies considered for sepg. CO2 from flue gas are costly, energy intensive, and if implemented, would result in large increases in electricity prodn. costs.  Membranes have potential as an energy-efficient, low-cost CO2 capture option.  Recently, working with the US Department of Energy (DOE), the authors developed membranes with CO2 permeances >1000 gpu and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 50 at 30\u00b0.  This permeance was 10 times higher than com. CO2 membranes and selectivity was among the highest reported for non-facilitated transport materials.  These membranes, in conjunction with a novel process design which uses incoming combustion air as a sweep gas to generate driving force, could meet DOE CO2 capture cost targets.  Under these conditions, improving membrane permeance is more important than increasing selectivity to further reduce flue gas CO2 capture costs.  Membrane cost and reliability issues are key to the eventual competitiveness of this technol. for flue gas treatment.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXnvFWrtbo%253D&md5=cc09ef7dc9bd3d4345a2e38af11ca580"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0012.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0013.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0014.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0015.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403477y/production/images/small/jp-2013-03477y_0016.gif\">"]}
