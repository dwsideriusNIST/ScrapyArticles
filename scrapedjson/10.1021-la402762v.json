This suggests the presence of a complementary irregular porosity in the carbon framework. As evidenced by Fuertes", "(6)", " and other authors,", "(8)", " the replication of mesoporous or microporous oxide structures by the nanocasting process results, normally, in an incomplete filling of the template pores. In this case, the nonfilled template pores also contribute to the overall pore volume, and as a result, the carbon contains two kinds of pores: (i) narrowly distributed ones, related to the oxide framework dissolution, and (ii) larger, broadly distributed ones formed by the coalescence of the nonfilled pores within the regular pores of the template. A similar phenomenon could occur here because the small pore size of the EMT template (microporosity instead of mesoporosity) precludes its complete filling. Moreover, other calculations based on the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation of carbon adsorption lead to a maximally achievable carbon loading of 43 wt % in the zeolite/carbon composite (i.e., 0.74 g of carbon per g of zeolite),", "(16)", " which is notably higher than the experimental value determined here (23 wt %). This means that the host material is not completely filled with carbon and residual porosity is still present in the zeolite/carbon composite.

The former is related to the regular nanocasting of the zeolite framework, being ordered with the porous features revealed by XRD (PSD peak around 1 nm; 48% of idealized structured porosity).

This porosity is distributed randomly in the carbon replica without regular correlations with the crystal lattice.

Random porosity II contributes to the diffuse background scattering that is not included in the Bragg diffraction modeling.", "These pore features were determined solely on the basis of the structural model derived from the XRD analysis and the amount of carbon introduced into the zeolite template. They should be in agreement with the data extracted from the adsorption analysis. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that most adsorption models for carbon materials were developed and validated for simple slitlike pore geometry. The complex structure of the EMT-ZTC materials with interconnected nanotubes, endo- or exohedral adsorption sites, and the porous network tortuosity apparently limits the validity of existing physisorption models from which only general trends may be derived reliably. A comparison of the XRD-based PSD (Figure ", "3", ") with the N", "2", " DFT-PDS (Figure ", "8", "a) suggests that the main maximum at around 1.2 nm can unambiguously be attributed to type I porosity resulting from the zeolite template dissolution.

The linear and PSD-DR treatments of the CO", "2", " isotherm lead to a bimodal pore distribution (Table ", "2", ") as suggested by the geometrical approach.

Therefore, all of these approaches based on both adsorption and XRD analysis lead to converging results. Type I pores have a size at the boundary between supermicropores and ultramicropores with a pore volume of around 0.2 cm", "3", "/g. Owing to the disordered nature of type II pores, it is more difficult to assess its PSD. The DR treatments give distinct maxima of around 1.8\u20131.9 nm for porosity of type II whereas the N", "2", " DFT analysis gives a continuous PSD for porosities of types I and II with values of 2.5\u20133 nm.

In this study, the conditions of the synthesis methods for prepg. the ordered microporous carbons were examd.  Temp. and duration parameters for the chem. vapor infiltration were optimized to yield an ordered carbon replica that displays \u22643 x-ray diffraction peaks.  This faithful replica exhibits also a high micropore vol. (1.3-1.4 cm3/g) with mainly supermicroporosity, a high sp. surface area (>2900 m2/g) and nearly no mesoporosity.  The pore size distribution calcd. with NLDFT method from nitrogen physisorption data shows three maxima at 0.6, 1.0 and 1.8 nm diams.  The second is due to the zeolite wall dissoln.  The first and the third are attributed to different types of default.  Compared to the classical two-step procedure, the direct infiltration with acetylene appears an interesting route for the prepn. of ordered microporous carbon replicas with high micropore vol.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXotlamsrc%253D&md5=6bc6e40028caba56f265c4078111b706", "26.

The results obtained show that CO2 adsorbs at 273 K in the different ranges of porosity following a mechanism similar to that of N2 at 77 K.  CO2 is sensitive to narrow micropores not accessible to N2 at 77 K, and hence, it is an adequate complement to N2 at 77 K.
