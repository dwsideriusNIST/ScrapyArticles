For example, because the bdc ligand resides on a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry element that lies in the ligand plane perpendicular to its long axis, to preclude disorder by crystallographic symmetry this ligand should be functionalized with identical groups on its 2,3 positions or on its 2,3,5,6 positions.

Everyone who works within the field of catalysis draws inspiration from the amazing functionality of nature's catalysts, the enzymes.  It is particularly the mild conditions that these catalysts are able to operate at and the selectivity that they demonstrate that make these materials dream targets for scientists involved in the art of synthesizing homogeneous and heterogeneous industrial catalysts.  But enzymes also have their weak points; in particular their low thermal stability and their often too slow reaction rates for an economical industrial process are problems that have to be overcome.  The obvious soln. would be to copy the catalytic active center into a robust open framework.  A key property of an enzyme is its selectivity; this property is partly regulated by steric constraints surrounding the catalytically active site.  The microporous zeolite based catalysts in some cases show impressive selectivity based on the geometrical constraints imposed by the size and shape of the regular channels in these cryst. silicate and alumino-phosphate based structures, and enzyme-like properties have been claimed but the pure inorg. nature of the selective internal surface in these materials makes it impossible to mimic many important enzymic properties.  The new generation of microporous materials, Metal Org. Frameworks (MOFs) are hybrids of org. and inorg. structures.  This dualistic nature offers an unprecedented flexibility in the possibility to incorporate both org. and metallic functional groups into the ordered cryst. lattice and thereby opening up for a much greater possibility to copy structural motifs known from enzymes into much simpler but also more stable open structures.  Several groups are working on development of new catalysts by this approach.

In coordination polymers, analogous results have recently been achieved using combinations of isomorphic linkers copolymd. by appropriate metals; in general, the properties of the resultant coordination copolymers can be described as a linear combination of the properties of the constituent building blocks.  This need not be the case: coordination copolymn. is a powerful strategy for directing phase formation.  For example, reaction of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid with Zn2+ typically affords phase-impure material in N,N-dimethylformamide whereas using an amino functionalized linker leads to pure high surface area material with the structure of MOF-5.  However, mixed-linker copolymers derived from a combination of both linkers display surface areas comparable to that of MOF-5 synthesized in N,N-diethylformamide, indicating that even a minor linker component can direct phase selection.  In a second illustration, the pore blockage of the bulky group in 9,10-bis(triisopropylsilyloxy)phenanthrene-2,7-dicarboxylate (TPDC) not only suppresses the framework interpenetration of biphenyl-based IRMOF architectures but also blocks adsorption sites, yielding a low surface area material.  However, the random coordination copolymn. of Zn2+ with a mixt. of TPDC and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl-4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylate (Me4BPDC) controls the level of framework interpenetration and the degree of pore blockage, resulting in higher surface area (up to \u223c3000 m2/g) copolymers than the noninterpenetrated Zn4O(TPDC)3 and interpenetrated Zn4O(Me4BPDC)3 frameworks.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXltlaqurk%253D&md5=6fde6f4d71a81ceff1aac4eb6e8ea52a", "(e) ", "Burrows", ", ", "A.

Based on MOF-5 a new synthetic route was developed which allows the partial substitution of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate (BDC) linkers in the material by functionalized 2-aminobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate.  In that way the no. of catalytically active amino groups can be tuned using the desired BDC/ABDC ratio.  The presence of MIXMOFs (instead of a mech. mixt. of MOF-5 and IRMOF-3) was proven by high-resoln. x-ray diffraction and DTG.  X-ray diffraction and TG/MS anal. revealed that pure MIXMOF materials can be obtained up to an ABDC loading of 40 %.  The thermal stability in air is decreasing with increasing ABDC content from 450 \u00b0C for pure MOF-5 (0 % ABDC) to ca. 350 \u00b0C for the 40 % MIXMOF Zn4O(BDC)1.8(ABDC)1.2.  Consequently, MIXMOF materials represent a promising class of materials for catalytic applications at least up to 300 \u00b0C which is proven using the synthesis of propylene carbonate (PC) from propylene oxide and carbon dioxide as a test reaction.  Solid MIXMOF catalysts in combination with tetraalkylammonium halides (NR4X) as promoters are as active as the corresponding homogeneously dissolved ref. compds. (H2ABDC, H2BDC and Zn salts) and that they can be recycled with only moderate loss in activity.  A comparison of MIXMOFs from 0 to 40 % of ABDC revealed a dependence of activity on the no. of amino groups.  Due to the fact that even pure MOF-5 catalyzed the reaction to some extent, surface Zn centers with free coordination sites might also contribute to substrate activation.  Using optimized reaction conditions, a PC yield of up to 63 % can be obtained after 3 h in the presence of low catalyst concn. (0.045 mol-% of 40 % MIXMOF, contg. 0.05 mol-% of NH2 groups).

DMOF-1-NH2 (DABCO MOF-1-NH2) is a deriv. of a previously studied MOF that contains two-dimensional square grids based on NH2-BDC and zinc(II) paddle-wheel units; the grid layers are connected by DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) mols. that coordinate in the axial positions of the paddlewheel secondary-building units (SBUs).

The structure of UMCM-1-NH2 was confirmed by single-crystal x-ray diffraction.  By using NH2-BDC to generate these MOFs, the pendant amino groups can serve as a chem. handle that can be manipulated via postsynthetic modification with alkyl anhydrides.  Reactions of each MOF and different anhydrides were performed to compare the extent of conversion, thermal and structural stability, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas afforded by the resulting materials.  Under comparable reaction conditions, 1H NMR of digested samples show that UMCM-1-NH2 has conversions comparable to that of IRMOF-3, while DMOF-1-NH2 only shows high conversions with smaller anhydrides.  Under specific reaction conditions, higher conversions were obtained with complete retention of crystallinity, as verified by single-crystal x-ray diffraction expts.  The results presented here demonstrate three important findings: (a) NH2-BDC can be used as a surrogate for BDC in a no. of MOFs thereby providing a handle for postsynthetic modification, (b) postsynthetic modification is a general strategy to functionalizing MOFs that can be applied to a variety of MOF structures, and (c) the topol. and chem./thermal stability of a MOF can influence the type of chem. reactions and reagents that can be used for postsynthetic modification.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhtl2ltb%252FJ&md5=4c92eadb89feb530b7c5983af853e95e", "(b) ", "Dau", ", ", "P.

In recent studies it is reported that covalent functionalization of the org. linker can influence or even integrate framework flexibility (breathing) in MOFs.  However, rational fine-tuning of such responsive properties is very desirable but challenging as well.  Here the authors present a powerful approach for the targeted manipulation of responsiveness and framework flexibility of an important family of pillared-layered MOFs based on the parent structure [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n (bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).  A library of functionalized bdc-type linkers (fu-bdc), which bear addnl. dangling side groups at different positions of the benzene core (alkoxy groups of varying chain length with diverse functionalities and polarity), was generated.  Synthesis of [Zn2(fu-bdc)2(dabco)]n yields the resp. collection of highly responsive MOFs.  The parent MOF is only weakly flexible; however, the substituted frameworks of [Zn2(fu-bdc)2(dabco)]n contract drastically upon guest removal and expand again upon adsorption of DMF, EtOH, or CO2, etc., while N2 is hardly adsorbed and does not open the narrow-pored form.  These breathing dynamics are attributed to the dangling side chains that act as immobilized guests, which interact with mobile guest mols. as well as with themselves and with the framework backbone.  The structural details of the guest-free, contracted form and the gas sorption behavior (phase transition pressure, hysteresis loop) are highly dependent on the nature of the substituent at the linker and can therefore be adjusted using the authors' approach.  Combining the authors' library of functionalized linkers with the concept of mixed-component MOFs (solid solns.) offers very rich addnl. dimensions of tailoring the structural dynamics and responsiveness.  Implementation of two differently functionalized linkers in varying ratios yields multicomponent single-phased [Zn2(fu-bdc')2x(fu-bdc'')2-2x(dabco)]n MOFs (0 < x < 1) of increased inherent complexity, which feature a nonlinear dependence of their gas sorption properties on the applied ratio of components.  Hence, the responsive behavior of such pillared-layered MOFs can be extensively tuned via an intelligent combination of functionalized linkers.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XmvV2gu7g%253D&md5=77c6f577d9bbe291f8f0acc44f27de76", "(c) ", "Garibay", ", ", "S.

The BET anal. is the std. method for detg. surface areas from nitrogen adsorption isotherms and was originally derived for multilayer gas adsorption onto flat surfaces.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of cryst., porous materials that exhibit very large BET surface areas.  These materials are microporous and possess surfaces that are far from flat.  In some MOFs, adsorption occurs through a pore-filling mechanism rather than by layer formation.  Thus, it is unclear whether BET surface area nos. reported for these materials are truly meaningful.  Given the std. practice of reporting BET surface areas for novel porous materials, a crit. test of the BET method is much needed.  Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict adsorption isotherms for nitrogen in MOFs.  The predicted isotherms were used as pseudoexperimental data to test the applicability of the BET theory for obtaining surface areas of microporous MOFs.  BET surface areas calcd. from the simulated isotherms agree very well with the accessible surface areas calcd. directly from the crystal structures in a geometric fashion.  The surface areas agree well with exptl. reports in the literature.
