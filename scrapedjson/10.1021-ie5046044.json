For each technol., we describe the fundamental sepn. mechanisms involved and the commonly applied process flow schemes designed to produce pipeline quality gas (typically 2% CO2, <3% N2) and gas to feed a cryogenic gas plant (typically 50 ppmv CO2, 1% N2).  Amine absorption technologies for CO2 and H2S removal (acid gas treating) are well-established in the natural gas industry.  The advantages and disadvantages of the conventional amine- and phys.-solvent-based processes for acid gas treating are discussed.  The use of CO2 selective membrane technologies for bulk sepn. of CO2 is increasing in the natural gas industry.  Novel low-temp. CO2 removal technologies such as ExxonMobil's Controlled Freeze Zone\u00ae process and rapid cycle pressure swing adsorption processes are also emerging as alternatives to amine scrubbers in certain applications such as for processing high CO2 concn. gases and for developing remote gas fields.  Cryogenic distn. remains the leading N2 rejection technol. for large scale (feed rates greater than 15 MMscfd) natural gas and liquefied natural gas plants.  However, technologies based on CH4 selective absorption and adsorption, as well as N2 selective pressure swing adsorption technologies, are com. available for smaller scale gas processing facilities.

The interest to remove CO2 from those gas streams to obtain fuel with enhanced energy content and prevent corrosion problems in the gas transportation system, in addn. to CO2 implications to the climate change, has driven the development of CO2 sepn. process technol.  One type of technol. which has experienced substantial growth, breakthroughs and advances during past decades is membrane-based technol.  The attractive features offered by this technol. include high energy efficiency, simplicity in design and construction of membrane modules and environmental compatibility.  The objective of this review is to overview the different types of membranes available for use including their working principles, current status and development which form the primary determinants of sepn. performance and efficiency.  The emphasis is toward CO2/CH4 sepn., considering its substantial and direct relevance to the gas industry.  To this end, discussion is made to cover polymeric gas permeation membranes; CO2-selective facilitated transport membranes, hollow fiber gas-liq. membrane contactors, inorg. membranes and mixed matrix membranes.  The market for CO2 sepn. is currently dominated by polymeric membranes due to their relatively low manufg. cost and processing ability into flat sheet and hollow fiber configurations as well as well-documented research studies.  While there have been immensely successful membrane prepn. and development techniques with consequential remarkable performance for each type of membrane.  Each type of membrane brings assocd. advantages and drawbacks related to the characteristic transport mechanism for specific application conditions.  Inorg. membranes, for example, are very suitable for high temp. CO2 sepn. in excess of 400 \u00b0C while all other membranes can be applied at lower temps.

Although adsorption sepn. processes offer an attractive platform to address the latter, working capacity and selectivity are usually limiting factors.  In this work, porous Sr2+- and Ba2+-UPRM-5 titanium silicates adsorbents exhibiting flexible structures were studied to elucidate their applicability for the sepn. of N2 from CH4 at ambient temp.  These materials showcase surface areas that are an order of magnitude larger than other flexible titanium silicates as a result of the incorporation of tetraethylammonium (TEA) as a structure-directing agent during the hydrothermal synthesis.  The adsorbents were fully characterized to consider their response to thermal treatment and its relation to adsorption selectivity.  For Sr2+-UPRM-5 (TEA), the selectivity reversal in favor of N2 at 25\u00b0 occurred upon pre-activation of the adsorbent at 180\u00b0.  However, for Ba2+-UPRM-5 (TEA) this happens at a pre-activation temp. of 320\u00b0 most likely due to its structural thermal stability.  Both materials did not exhibit N2 adsorption satn. within a 10 atm range and 25\u00b0, a reflection of the availability of larger surface areas and a feature suitable for natural gas upgrading at higher pressures.  At 25\u00b0, the max. obsd. kinetic selectivity value in favor of N2 and estd. at CH4 and N2 pressures of 0.95 and 0.05 atm was 25, which matches results reported for the com. available ETS-4 type titanium silicate.

Adsorption isotherms for CO2 in Mn+-SAPO-34 materials displayed a nonlinear behavior and did not follow the typical pore-filling mechanism.  In general, the overall adsorption performance of the exchanged materials increased as follows: Ce3+ < Ti3+ < Mg2+ < Ca2+ < Ag+ < Na+ < Sr2+.  The strontium exchanged materials excelled at low-pressure ranges, exhibiting sharp isotherm slopes at all temps.  For example, the Sr2+-SAPO-34 sorbents were capable of removing as much as 2.8 wt. % at a CO2 partial pressure of 10-3 atm and room temp.  Isosteric heat of adsorption data confirmed that the Sr2+ species were responsible for the surface strong interaction, and therefore it is plausible to state that cations were occupying exposed sites (SII') in the material Chabazite cages.  In addn., all divalent cations were found to interact more with the sorbate when compared to the other charged species.  Adsorption isotherms for trivalent exchanged cations (Ce3+, Ti3+), showed what appears to be partial blockage of pore windows (occupancy of SIII), resulting in low adsorption capacities.  The surface interactions were analyzed according to electrostatic and nonspecific contributions.

Na+-UPRM-5 polymorphs were employed to elucidate the level of polymorphism or faulting in the crystal structure.  DIFFaX simulations revealed that it was impossible to match the exptl. diffraction data based solely on pure polymorphs.  Instead, an intergrowth of combinations of polymorphs in the a and c directions resulted in the best faulting simulation scenario.  The most suitable model combined two (2) orthorhombic polymorphs with faulting of 90 and 10% in the a and c directions, resp.  A refinement using this model did not yield a reliable structure, but an approxn. was possible after employing a combination of orthorhombic and faulted triclinic phases.  The superposition model, however, was not able to predict the final configuration of the TiO5 plausibly due to the unprecedented level of faulting in the structure.  Upon convergence (\u03c72 = 13.68), the triclinic phase accounted for \u223c14% (molar basis) of the overall phase, being this further evidence of the level of faulting present in UPRM-5.  The refined structure also revealed Si-O and Ti-O distances and angles that contrast with those reported for a Ti silicate known as ETS-4, and related to structural distortion.  These changes are plausibly attributed to the presence of the TEA+ cations and the strong interaction of the framework O with Na cations, which were also exposed to the 8MR pore channel as described by a pair distribution function (PDF) refinement.

The effects of heat-treatment on the dimensions of the transport-controlling eight-membered ring (8MR) are elucidated by Rietveld anal.  Also during heat-treatment: (a) the double three membered rings (D3MRs) in ETS-4 are sites of structural instability, (b) the TiO2 chains running along [010] exhibit a large degree of disorder in the bridging O atoms, and (c) significant relocations of the Sr cations take place, which may affect the sepn. properties of the heat-treated materials.

The high-silica zeolite SSZ-45, which was synthesized using N-cyclopentyldiazabicyclooctane as the structure directing agent (SDA), was found to exhibit excellent thermal stability and rather unusual adsorption properties under pressure.  That is, it has potential in the area of small mol. sepns.  Of particular interest, therefore, was the structural basis for its peculiar adsorption behavior.  The relatively complex silicate framework structure of SSZ-45 was detd. from a combination of synchrotron powder diffraction and rotation electron diffraction data.  Once the framework was known, it was possible to locate the org. SDA in the cavities and to better understand its contribution to the formation of the zeolite.
