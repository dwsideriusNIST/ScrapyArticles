Their chemical resistance makes them materials difficult to replace. Moreover, their structure and chemical character can be modified in many ways and adjusted for specific purposes (Fontanals et al. ", "2007", "; Pan et al. ", "2005", "). That is why polymers are invariably under researchers\u2019 investigation.", "The search of new polymeric materials, used as sorbents, is particularly important from the point of view of environmental protection. Many chemical pollutants possess polar character. In order to isolate such substances from environmental matrices, polar sorbents can be used. Chemical modification of already existing polymeric sorbents or designing new ones can help to solve the problem of removing from the environment a large variety of polar pollutants (Feng et al. ", "2009", "; Rodil et al. ", "2012", ").", "The ability to interact with living organisms and the inanimate matter of nature, as well as the chemical properties of compounds strongly depend on their structure. The kind, number and position of substituents may alter substantially the way of interaction of a molecule with its surroundings (Lu and Sorial ", "2007", "). Phenol and its chlorinated derivatives belong to the same group of phenolic compounds, however their properties and toxicity vary in a wide range. The enhanced attraction with the surface in the case of chlorophenols is due to the electron-withdrawal phenomenon of the chlorine substituents, as they reduce the overall electron density of the aromatic ring (Podkoscielny and Nieszporek ", "2011", "; L\u00e1szl\u00f3 et al. ", "2003", "). Phenol is more quickly biodegradable, whereas chlorophenols are biodegradable relatively slow (Olaniran and Igbinosa ", "2011", "). Phenols are very toxic even at low concentrations and cause an unpleasant odour and taste of water.", "The value of logarithm of the octanol\u2013water partition coefficient (K", "ow", "), i.e. log K", "ow", " is often used as basic bioaccumulation criterion. If its value is in the range of 1\u20133, bioaccumulation is estimated as low or moderate, for values higher than 3, substances are considered as possessing high accumulation potential.

Advantage of these materials is that, they can be used repeatedly as the desorption and regeneration is possible.", "New porous copolymeric microspheres were prepared by suspension-emulsion polymerization BES.DM with GMA. Multistage modification of the obtained adsorbent was made. Firstly, the copolymers were modified with amines (BDA, EDTA, TETA) in the epoxide ring opening reaction and next successful modification of primary amino groups by addition of HCO", "3", "\u2212", " was carried out. When HCO", "3", "\u2212", " groups were introduced to the structures, the sorption capability increased and changes in affinity toward chlorophenols in comparison to the amine derivatives were additionally observed.", "Both amines and bicarbonate groups were able to take part in the dissociation process and alter the pH of aqueous solution. As a consequence, the dissociation of chlorophenols was shifted to unionized forms that have positive influence on their sorption. This effect is especially visible in the case of the most toxic 2,4-dichlorophenol for which the best recovery results were achieved."], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO1\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig1_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig1_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO2\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig2_HTML.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig2_HTML.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO3\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig3_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig3_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO4\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig4_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig4_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO5\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig5_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig5_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO6\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig6_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig6_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO7\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig7a_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig7a_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO70\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig7b_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9749-6/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9749_Fig7b_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>"]}
