On the external surface, the ordered porous structure will be more or less damaged due to the surface defects. Therefore, as the particle size goes down to nanoscale, there will be an inevitable loss of SSA due to the higher fraction of the external surface. This is contradictory to that of nonporous materials where smaller particles give higher SSA. Notably, the SSA of the ZIF-8 nanocrystals prepared by the surface mediated method also reaches a very high value, which is 1360, 1143, and 1225 m", "2", "/g for the nanocrystals prepared at 60, 25, and 0 \u00b0C, respectively. As a general trend, the SSA slightly decreases as the particle size goes down, which is in agreement with the above analysis. Another important reason for the loss of the SSA is the residual surfactants or solvent molecules that block some of the pores. This may introduce a slight inconsistency to the general trend, as observed for the samples prepared at 25 and 0 \u00b0C. Nevertheless, the SSA of the ZIF-8 nanocrystals is quite close to that of the hydrothermally prepared large particles, implying that the surfactants and the guest molecules in the pores are largely removed.

However, the adsorption kinetics is also an important concern for real applications.

Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.  Because we can functionalize the pores to direct their specific recognition of small mols., the emerging porous MOFs serve as novel functional materials for gas storage, sepn., heterogeneous catalysis, and sensing.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlslyhtrs%253D&md5=f9230905a5656f9fe0e487967ecae356", "4.

Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.

The fabrication of thin film coatings of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) on various substrates is discussed in this crit. review.  Interestingly, the relatively few studies on MOF films that have appeared in the literature are limited to the following cases: [Zn4O(bdc)3] (MOF-5; bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), [Cu3(btc)2] (HKUST-1; btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)] (dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), [Mn(HCOO)], [Cu2(pzdc)2(pyz)] (CPL-1; pzdc = pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate, pyz = pyrazine), [Fe(OH)(bdc)] (MIL-53(Fe)) and [Fe3O(bdc)3(Ac)] (MIL-88B; Ac = CH3COO-).  Various substrates and support materials have been used, including silica, porous alumina, graphite and org. surfaces, i.e. self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold, as well as silica surfaces.  Most of the MOF films were grown by immersion of the selected substrates into specifically pre-treated solvothermal mother liquors of the particular MOF material.  This results in more or less densely packed films of intergrown primary crystallites of sizes ranging up to several \u03bcm, leading to corresponding film thicknesses.  Alternatively, almost atomically flat and very homogeneous films, with thicknesses of up to ca. 100 nm, were grown in a novel stepwise layer-by-layer method.  The individual growth steps are sepd. by removing unreacted components via rinsing the substrate with the solvent.  The layer-by-layer method offers the possibility to study the kinetics of film formation in more detail using surface plasmon resonance.  In some cases, particularly on SAM-modified substrates, a highly oriented growth was obsd., and in the case of the MIL-53/MIL-88B system, a phase selective deposition of MIL-88B, rather than MIL-53(Fe), was reported.

Colloidal metal-org. frameworks (CMOFs), nanoporous colloidal-sized crystals that are uniform in both size and polyhedral shape, are crystals composed of metal ions and org. bridging ligands, which can be used as building blocks for self-assembly in org. and aq. liqs.  They stand in contrast to conventional metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), which scientists normally study as bulk cryst. powders.  However, powder MOFs generally have random crystal size and shape and therefore do not possess either a definite mutual arrangement with adjacent particles or uniformity.  CMOFs do have this quality, which can be important in vital uptake and release kinetics.  In this Account, the authors present the diverse methods of synthesis, pore chem. control, surface modification, and assembly techniques of CMOFs.  The authors survey recent achievements and future applications in this emerging field.  There is potential for a paradigm shift, away from using just bulk cryst. powders, towards using particles whose size and shape are regulated.  The concept of colloidal MOFs takes into account that nanoporous MOFs, conventionally prepd. as bulk cryst. powders with random crystal size, shape, and orientation, may also form colloidal-sized objects with uniform size and morphol.  Also, the traditional MOF functions that depend on porosity present addnl. control over those MOF functions that depend on pore interactions.  They also can enable controlled spatial arrangements between neighboring particles.  To begin, progress regarding synthesis of MOF nano- and microcrystals whose crystal size and shape are well regulated are discussed.  Next, the authors review the methods to modify the surfaces with dye mols. and polymers.  Dyes are useful when seeking to observe nonluminescent CMOFs in situ by optical microscopy, while polymers are useful to tune their interparticle interactions.  Third, criteria to assess the stability of CMOFs for various applications are discussed.  In another section of this Account, the authors give examples of supracrystal assembly in liq., on substrates, at interfaces, and under external elec. fields.

Control of crystal size is achieved in a novel approach by employing an excess of the bridging bidentate ligand and various simple auxiliary monodentate ligands with different chem. functionalities (carboxylate, N-heterocycle, alkylamine).  The function of the monodentate ligands can be understood as a modulation of complex formation and deprotonation equil. during crystal nucleation and growth.  Using time-resolved static light scattering, the functioning of modulating ligands is monitored for the 1st time by in situ expts., which offered significant insight into the crystal growth processes.  Formation of nanocrystals is characterized by continuous, comparatively slow nucleation and fast crystal growth occurring on a time scale of seconds.  Although nucleation and growth are not sepd. from each other, a significant narrowing of the particle size distribution during early stages results in rather monodisperse nanocrystals, before broadening of the particle size distribution occurs, as obsd. by complementary ex situ electron microscopy studies.  Microcrystal growth is dominated by a particle-monomer addn. mechanism, but indications for the operation of a coalescence process during early stages of growth were also obtained.  During later stages of microcrystal growth crystals change their shape from cubes to rhombic dodecahedra.

The synthesis and structure of a mixed Zn/Cu metal-org. framework material Zn3(BDC)3[Cu(Pyen)]\u00b7(DMF)5(H2O)5 (H2BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and PyenH2 = (5-methyl-4-hydroxopyridine-3-methylene)ethylenediaminecarbaldehyde) is reported.  Desolvation provides a bimodal porous structure Zn3(BDC)3[Cu(Pyen)] (M'MOF 1) with narrow porosity (<0.56 nm) and an array of pores in the bc crystallog. plane where the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions are maximized by both the presence of open Cu centers and overlap of the potential energy fields from pore walls.  The H2 and D2 adsorption isotherms for M'MOF 1 at 77.3 and 87.3 K were reversible with virtually no hysteresis.  Methods for detn. of the isosteric enthalpies of H2 and D2 adsorption were compared.  A virial model gave the best agreement (av. deviation <1 std. deviation) with the isotherm data.  This was used in conjunction with the van't Hoff isochore giving isosteric enthalpies at zero surface coverage of 12.29 \u00b1 0.53 and 12.44 \u00b1 0.50 kJ mol-1 for H2 and D2 adsorption, resp.  This is the highest value so far obsd. for H adsorption on a porous material.  The enthalpy of adsorption, decreases with increasing amt. adsorbed to 9.5 kJ mol-1 at .ltorsim.\u22481.9 mmol g-1 (2 H2 or D2 mols. per Cu corresponding to adsorption on both sides of planar Cu open centers) and is virtually unchanged in the range 1.9-3.6 mmol g-1.  Virial anal. of isotherms at 87.3 K is also consistent with 2 H2 or D2 mols. being bound to each open Cu center.  The adsorption kinetics follow a double exponential model, corresponding to diffusion along 2 types of pores, a slow component with high activation energy (13.35 \u00b1 0.59 kJ mol-1) for the narrow pores and a faster component with low activation energy (8.56 \u00b1 0.41 kJ mol-1).  The D2 adsorption kinetic consts. for both components were significantly faster than the corresponding H2 kinetics for specific pressure increments and had slightly lower activation energies than the corresponding values for H2 adsorption.  The kD2/kH2 ratio for the slow component was 1.62 \u00b1 0.07, while the fast component was 1.38 \u00b1 0.04 at 77.3 K, and the corresponding ratios were smaller at 87.3 K.  These observations of kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving in porous materials are due to the larger zero-point energy for the lighter H2, resulting in slower adsorption kinetics compared with the heavier D2.  A combination of open metal centers and confinement in ultramicroporosity leads to a high enthalpy for H2 adsorption over a wide range of surface coverage and quantum effects influence diffusion of H2 and D2 in pores in M'MOF 1.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXltVyjsLo%253D&md5=cd9993fbfa093dfecfd6324ec8f7d042", "29.

The adsorption equil. selectivity was calcd. from the ratio of Henry's consts., and the adsorbent selection parameter for pressure swing adsorption processes were detd. by combining the equil. selectivity and working capacity ratio.
