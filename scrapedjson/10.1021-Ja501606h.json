However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.  Hence, one of the important challenges going forward is to find ways to pack MOFs efficiently without serious damage or to synthesize MOFs that can withstand substantial mech. pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtV2msbrN&md5=23f9bfad78f204569f0bf7c902d42dca", "7.

Its 3 D framework is built up of infinite trans chains of corner-sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra.  The chains are interconnected by the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate groups, creating 1 D rhombic-shaped tunnels.  Disordered 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid mols. are trapped inside these tunnels.  Their evacuation upon heating, between 275 and 420\u00b0, leads to a nanoporous open-framework (MIL-53ht (Al) or Al(OH)[O2CC6H4CO2]) with empty pores of diam. 8.5 \u00c5.  This solid exhibits a Langmuir surface area. of 1590(1) m2g-1 together with a remarkable thermal stability, since it starts to decomp. only at 500\u00b0.  At room temp., the solid reversibly absorbs H2O in its tunnels, causing a very large breathing effect and shrinkage of the pores.  Anal. of the hydration process by solid-state NMR (1H, 13C, 27Al) has clearly indicated that the trapped H2O mols. interact with the carboxylate groups through H bonds, but do not affect the hydroxyl species bridging the Al atoms.
