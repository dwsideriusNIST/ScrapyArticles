The advantages of the prodn. of hybrid materials, metal-org. framework (MOF) adsorbents, expected for the biogas upgrading, rely on the bulk sepn. of CO2 under near-ambient conditions.  This review highlights the challenges for MOF adsorbents, which have the greatest upgrading abilities for biogas via selective passage of methane.  The key factors improving the ideal MOF materials for these high CO2 capture and selectivity uses for biogas upgrading to produce bio-methane and reduce fossil-fuel CO2 emission will be discussed.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhvVShsb7O&md5=27bcd6645186b51807c93c625626de05", "5.

In the present paper, we report numerical calcns. for the helium, neon, water, and carbon dioxide dimers and show that for a wide range of intermonomer sepns., including the van der Waals and short-range repulsion regions, the method provides dispersion energies with accuracies comparable to those that can be achieved using the current most sophisticated wave-function methods.  If the dispersion energy is combined with (i) the electrostatic and first-order exchange interaction energies as defined in symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) but computed using monomer Kohn-Sham (KS) determinants, and (ii) the induction energy computed using the coupled KS static response theory, (iii) the exchange-induction and exchange-dispersion energies computed using KS orbitals and orbital energies, the resulting method, denoted by SAPT(DFT), produces very accurate total interaction potentials.  For the helium dimer, the only system with nearly exact benchmark values, SAPT(DFT) reproduces the interaction energy to within about 2% at the min. and to a similar accuracy for all other distances ranging from the strongly repulsive to the asymptotic region.  For the remaining systems investigated by us, the quality of the SAPT(DFT) interaction energies is so high that these energies may actually be more accurate than the best available results obtained with wave-function techniques.

Iron, as a first row transition metal, provides a weak ligand-field splitting in an octahedral environment.  This results in the presence of low-lying 5T excited states that, depending on the identity of iron ligands, can become the ground state of the complex.  The small energy difference between the low-spin, 1A, and high-spin, 5T, states presents a challenge for accurate prediction of their ground state using d. functional theory.  In this work, we investigate the applicability of the B3LYP functional to the ground state detn. of first row transition metal complexes, focusing mainly on Fe(II) polypyridine complexes with ligands of varying ligand field strength.  It has been shown previously that B3LYP artificially favors the 5T state as the ground state of Fe(II) complexes, and the error in the energy differences between the 1A and 5T states is systematic for a set of structurally related complexes.  We demonstrate that structurally related complexes can be defined as pseudo-octahedral complexes that undergo similar distortion in the metal-ligand coordination environment between the high-spin and low-spin states.  The systematic behavior of complexes with similar distortion can be exploited, and the ground state of an arbitrary Fe(II) complex can be detd. by comparing the calcd. energy differences between the singlet and quintet electronic states of a complex to the energy differences of structurally related complexes with a known, exptl. detd. ground state.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XnsVKrsLc%253D&md5=b025afcba2cc19000a9165657fcce3ee", "24.

The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach.  With a d. matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion.  It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of d. matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter.  Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary d. matrices from the symbolic formula list.  It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations.
