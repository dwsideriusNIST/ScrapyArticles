Adsorption and desorption isotherms are obtained over a wide range of concentrations from less than 0.1% to beyond 80% of the vapor pressure. Evidence is provided in support of a proposed bimodal water adsorption mechanism that involves the interaction of water molecules with functional groups at low relative pressures and the adsorption of water molecules between graphene layers at higher pressures. Decomposition of the equilibrium isotherm data through application of the extended cooperative multimolecular sorption theory, together with favorable quantitative comparison, provides support for the proposed adsorption mechanism. Additional support is obtained from a multitemperature study of water equilibrium. Temperatures of 20, 50, and 60 \u00b0C were probed in this investigation in order to provide isosteric heat of adsorption data for water interaction with the carbon molecular sieve. At low loading, the derived isosteric heat of adsorption is estimated to be 69 kJ/mol. This value is indicative of the adsorption of water to functional groups. At higher loading, the isosteric heat of adsorption decreases with increasing loading and approaches the heat of condensation, indicative of adsorption between graphene layers. Further support for the proposed adsorption mechanism is derived from carbon dioxide adsorption experiments on carbon molecular sieve that is preadsorbed with various amounts of water. Significant exclusion of carbon dioxide occurs, and a quantitative analysis that is based on the proposed bimodal water adsorption mechanism is employed in this investigation.

More relevant to current needs are studies that focus on the individual contribution of water and carbon surface interactions, isolated from the intrusion of layering and capillary condensation.

These increments can lead to large changes in the diffusivity and a nonlinear isotherm over the pressure range in which the measurement is taken. Additionally, large increments lead to nonisothermal conditions during the uptake, thereby introducing an additional phenomenon of heat transfer to affect the uptake kinetics.

Special emphasis is placed on the question of whether water exhibits capillary condensation (i.e., condensation when the external pressure is below the bulk vapor pressure).  Three models of water have been considered.  These are the SPC and SPC/E models and a model where the hydrogen bonding is described by tetrahedrally coordinated square-well assocn. sites.  The water-carbon interaction was described by the Steele 10-4-3 potential.  In addn. to detg. adsorption/desorption isotherms, we also locate the states where vapor-liq. equil. occurs for both the bulk and confined states of the models.  We find that for wider pores (widths >1 nm), condensation does not occur in the GCMC simulations until the pressure is higher than the bulk vapor pressure, P0.  This is consistent with a phys. picture where a lack of hydrogen bonding with the graphite surface destabilizes dense water phases relative to the bulk.  For narrow pores where the slit width is comparable to the mol. diam., strong dispersion interactions with both carbon surfaces can stabilize dense water phases relative to the bulk so that pore condensation can occur for P < P0 in some cases.  For the narrowest pores studied-a pore width of 0.6 nm-pore condensation is again shifted to P > P0.  The phase-equil. calcns. indicate vapor-liq. coexistence in the slit pores for P < P0 for all but the narrowest pores.

The presence of water vapor in the gas stream has a negligible influence on n-butane adsorption for values of relative humidity (RH) equal to or below 25%.  Higher water pressures cause a significant loss of adsorption capacity in ACFMs.  Equil. water adsorption on ACFMs can be described by the Do and Do model [Carbon 38 (2000) 767] modified in order to account for both the variable size of the water aggregates on acid centers and the variable size of the clusters detached from the aggregates and inserted into the micropores.  The model results show close agreement between the amts. of active sites for adsorption calcd. by the model and the no. expected from subjecting the ACFMs to different pre-treatments.  The equil. of coadsorption of water and n-butane can be described by a pore filling concept according to which the vol. occupied by both gases adsorbed together from the gas mixt. is approx. equal to the vol. occupied by the pure component adsorbed sep. to a greater extent.  Pre-moistening of the monolith has little effect on its effective n-butane adsorption capacity (breakthrough time) during dynamic adsorption expts.  For values of relative humidity equal to or below 25%, the effective n-butane adsorption capacity of the monoliths was better than that of active C powder.
