Adjustments of linker geometry, length, ratio, and functional-group can tune the size, shape, and internal surface property of a MOF for a targeted application.  In this crit. review, the authors highlight advances in MOF synthesis focusing on linker design.  Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, mol. recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described.  Further search for application-oriented MOFs through judicious selection of metal clusters and org. linkers is desirable.  In this review, linkers are categorized as ditopic (Section 1), tritopic (Section 2), tetratopic (Section 3), hexatopic (Section 4), octatopic (Section 5), mixed (Section 6), desymmetrized (Section 7), metallo (Section 8), and N-heterocyclic linkers (Section 9).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXht1Slu7jK&md5=322785c0256204742e3e95e5d2d49914", "3.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) have recently attracted intense research interest because of their permanent porous structures, large surface areas, and potential applications as novel adsorbents.  The recent progress in adsorption-based CO2 capture by MOFs is reviewed and summarized in this crit. review.  CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approx. atm. pressures.  Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore vols. of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, resp.  Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4.  Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites.  In addn., strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chem. bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement.

The work reported here seeks to address this crit. issue by examg. two important contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pKa value) of the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework.  Catenation is the interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and independent frameworks.  Using catenation in combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pKa value).  After 90% relative humidity (RH) exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508), MOF-508 is stable due to its 2-fold interpenetration that prevents significant water adsorption.  In contrast, comparing noncatenated isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM) and Zn-TMBDC-BPY (MOF-508-TM), MOF-508-TM is unstable since BPY is less basic (higher pKa) and less rigid than DABCO.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhs1ehs7fM&md5=aa2a36a83aff9f403c6ba44f98ac074a", "(b) ", "Liu", ", ", "H.", "; ", "Zhao", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Zhang", ", ", "Z.", "; ", "Nijem", ", ", "N.", "; ", "Chabal", ", ", "Y.

Mechanistic details for oxidn. reactions employing tert-Bu hydroperoxide are studied by UV/Vis and IR spectroscopy and XRPD measurements.

The authors report an example of interpenetration that is simply controlled by the presence of a carbon-carbon double or single bond in identical org. building blocks, and provide a comparison of gas-sorption properties for these similar frameworks, which differ only in their degree of interpenetration.  Non-interpenetrated (SNU-70) and doubly interpenetrated (SNU-71) cubic nets were prepd. by a solvothermal reaction of [Zn(NO3)2]\u00b76H2O in N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) with 4-(2-carboxyvinyl)benzoic acid and 4-(2-carboxyethyl)benzoic acid, resp.  They have almost identical structures, but the non-interpenetrated framework has a much bigger pore size (ca. 9.0 \u00d7 9.0 \u00c5) than the interpenetrated framework (ca. 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00c5).  Activation of the MOFs by using supercrit. CO2 gave SNU-70' and SNU-71'.  The simulation of the PXRD pattern of SNU-71' indicates the rearrangement of the interpenetrated networks on guest removal, which increases pore size.  SNU-70' has a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 5290 m2 g-1, which is the highest value reported to date for a MOF with a cubic-net structure, whereas SNU-71' has a BET surface area of 1770 m2 g-1.  In general, non-interpenetrated SNU-70' exhibits much higher gas-adsorption capacities than interpenetrated SNU-71' at high pressures, regardless of the temp.  However, at P < 1 atm, the gas adsorption capacities for N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 195 K are higher for non-interpenetrated SNU-70' than for interpenetrated SNU-71', but the capacities for H2 and CH4 are the opposite; SNU-71' has higher uptake capacities than SNU-70' due to the higher isosteric heat of gas adsorption that results from the smaller pores.  In particular, SNU-70' has exceptionally high H2 and CO2 uptake capacities.  By using a post-synthetic method, the C:C double bond in SNU-70 was quant. brominated at room temp., and the MOF still showed very high porosity (BET surface area of 2285 m2 g-1).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xot12hurs%253D&md5=774869cd2d3921873676452328e9fce6", "22.
