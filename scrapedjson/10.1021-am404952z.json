This review highlights the challenges for capture technologies which have the greatest likelihood of reducing CO2 emissions to the atm., namely postcombustion (predominantly CO2/N2 sepn.), precombustion (CO2/H2) capture, and natural gas sweetening (CO2/CH4).

Because of the strong affinity with the framework, CO2 is preferentially adsorbed over CH4 in all MOFs.  Framework catenation leads to constricted pores and addnl. adsorption sites and enhances the interaction with the adsorbate.  Therefore, catenated IRMOF-13 and PCN-6 exhibit a greater extent of adsorption, particularly for CO2, at low pressures than IRMOF-14 and PCN-6'; however, the opposite is true at high pressures. CO2/CH4 selectivity in IRMOF-1 and IRMOF-14 is almost const. at low pressures and increases with increasing pressure.  As a result of a counterbalance between energetic and entropic effects, the selectivity in IRMOF-13 initially decreases at low pressures and then increases with pressure and finally approaches a const. value.  Catenated MOFs have a higher selectivity than their noncatenated counterparts.  The presence of electrostatic interaction between CO2 and the framework increases CO2 adsorption and a corresponding decrease in CH4 adsorption and consequently enhanced selectivity.  In charged soc-MOF, the extra framework NO3- ions are identified to be equally distributed from the nearest metal atoms and vibrate around the favorable sites.  The selectivity in soc-MOF is substantially higher than in the other IRMOFs and PCNs and is the highest among various MOFs reported to date.  The simulation results reveal that the selectivity of CO2 over CH4 in MOFs is enhanced slightly by exposed metals, catenation, and significantly by extra framework ions and that charged MOFs are promising candidates for the sepn. of CO2/CH4 mixt.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhsFWqsrzJ&md5=ef842ff48eaf8da43b23f4f9d42e985c", "63.

CO2 is preferentially adsorbed over CO and N2 in all MOFs.  Cu-BTC displays higher selectivities for CO2 over CO at lower pressures and CO2 over N2 at all pressures for all mixts. due to the increase in electrostatic interactions of CO2 with the exposed copper sites.  However, IRMOF-3 shows surprisingly high selectivities for CO2 over CO for 50% and 95% mixts. at higher pressures due to the presence of amine-functionalized groups and high pore vol.  CO2 selectivities increase with increasing CO2 concn. in the gas mixts. at total pressures above 5 bar.

From the validated force fields, both adsorption selectivity and pure CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms were simulated.  Although MOFs perform much better for gas storage, their sepn. performance is comparable to zeolites; for the systems with the preferable component having a larger quadrupolar moment, both zeolites and MOFs can enhance the sepn. selectivity, and in contrast they both reduce the selectivity.  Ideal adsorbed soln. theory (IAST) gives a very reasonable prediction of the mixt. adsorption isotherms both in zeolites and in MOFs if the pure component isotherms are known.
