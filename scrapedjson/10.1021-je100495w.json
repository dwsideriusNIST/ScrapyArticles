For carbons, for which the av. enthalpy change is typically 5.8 kJ/mol, an optimum operating temp. of about 115 K is predicted.  For methane, an optimum enthalpy change of 18.8 kJ/mol is found, with the optimum temp. for carbons being 254 K.  It is also demonstrated that for max. delivery of the gas the optimum adsorbent must be homogeneous, and that introduction of heterogeneity, such as by ball milling, irradn., and other means, can only provide small increases in physisorption-related delivery for hydrogen.  For methane, heterogeneity is always detrimental, at any value of av. adsorption enthalpy change.  These results are confirmed with the help of exptl. data from the literature, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations conducted here using slit pore models of activated carbons as well as atomistic models of carbon nanotubes.  The simulations also demonstrate that carbon nanotubes offer little or no advantage over activated carbons in terms of enhanced delivery, when used as storage media for either hydrogen or methane.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XksFSruw%253D%253D&md5=4ef6bc99f1ab97df527da6b2243e9d7a", "5.
