As is common when comparing experimental powder patterns with a simulated structure, reflection intensities of experimental patterns do not match perfectly with the simulated pattern, but all experimental patterns (under similar conditions) match quite well with one another. The deviation of as-synthesized forms from the simulated pattern is attributed to the fact that the single crystal data include no contributions from solvent molecules that reside in the pores of the structure, while deviations apparent in the activated structure arise from slight distortions in the framework to minimize the energy after the pores are evacuated. The most notable trend observed is seen in the PXRD patterns after 16 days of exposure to atmospheric conditions (50% r.h.).

In this crit. review we discuss the potential of LnMOFs as multifunctional systems, which combine light emission with properties such as microporosity, magnetism, chirality, mol. and ion sensing, catalysis and activity as multimodal imaging contrast agents.  We argue that these materials present a unique chance of observing synergy between several of these properties, such as the coupling between photoluminescence and magnetism.  Moreover, an integrated approach towards the design of efficient, stable, cheap, environmentally-friendly and multifunctional luminescent LnMOFs is still missing.

However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.

The addn. of functional groups (-Br, -NH2, -C2H4-) to the phenylene links of IRMOF-1 (MOF-5), or their replacement with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moieties in IRMOF-20, altered the adsorption behavior by a minor amt. despite large variations in the pore vols. of the resulting materials.

Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies reveal that the initial sites occupied by adsorbed H2 are the open Cu centers of the paddlewheel units with comparable interaction energies in the two isomers.  At high H2 loadings, where the H2 mols. adsorb mainly on or around the org. linkers, the interaction is substantially stronger in catenated PCN-6 than in noncatenated PCN-6', leading to much higher H2 uptake in the isomer with catenation.  Hydrogen sorption measurements at pressures up to 50 bar demonstrate that framework catenation can be favorable for the enhancement of hydrogen adsorption.  For example, the excess hydrogen uptake of PCN-6 is 72 mg/g (6.7%) at 77 K/50 bar or 9.3 mg/g (0.92%) at 298 K/50 bar, resp., and that for PCN-6' is 42 mg/g (4.0%) at 77 K/50 bar or 4.0 mg/g (0.40%) at 298 K/50 bar.
