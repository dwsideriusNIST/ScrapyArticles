The tiny NO-releasing particles are synthesized by first tethering alkylamines onto the surface of the silica using amine-contg. silylation reagents.  These amine groups are then converted to corresponding N-diazeniumdiolate groups via reaction with NO(g) at high pressure in the presence of methoxide bases (e.g., NaOMe). N-Diazeniumdiolate groups were found to form more readily with secondary amino nitrogens than primary amino nitrogens tethered to the silica.  Different alkali metal cations of the methoxide bases, however, have little effect on the degree of N-diazeniumdiolate formation.  The N-diazeniumdiolate moieties attached on the silica surface undergo a primarily proton-driven dissocn. to NO under physiol. conditions, with an \"apparent\" reaction order somewhat greater than 1 owing to local increases in pH at the surface of the particles as free amine groups are generated.  The rates of N-diazeniumdiolate dissocn. are further related to the parent amine structures and the pH of the soaking buffer.  The N-diazeniumdiolate groups also undergo slow thermal dissocn. to NO, with zero-order dissocn. obsd. at both -15 and 23 \u00b0C.  It is further shown that the resulting NO-releasing fumed silica particles can be embedded into polymer films to create coatings that are thromboresistant, via the release of NO at fluxes that mimic healthy endothelial cells (EC).  For example a polyurethane coating contg. 20 wt % of NO-releasing particles prepd. with pendant hexanediamine structure (i.e., Sil-2N[6]-N2O2Na) is shown to exhibit improved surface thromboresistivity (compared to controls) when used to coat the inner walls of extracorporeal circuits (ECC) employed in a rabbit model for extracorporeal blood circulation.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXis1eqtLw%253D&md5=52684cefe2b5c28f1ddc44b0449509af", "9.

The authors' main objective is to offer an appropriate means to assist/aid chemists and material designers alike to rationally construct desired functional MOF materials, made-to-order MOFs.  The authors introduce the concept of net-coded building units (net-cBUs), where precise embedded geometrical information codes uniquely and matchlessly a selected net, as a compelling route for the rational design of MOFs.  This concept is based on employing pre-selected 0-periodic metal-org. polyhedra or 2-periodic metal-org. layers, SBBs or SBLs, resp., as a pathway to access the requisite net-cBUs.  In this review, inspired by the authors' success with the original rht-MOF, the authors extrapolated the authors' strategy to other known MOFs via their deconstruction into more elaborate building units (polyhedra or layers) to (i) elucidate the unique relation between edge-transitive polyhedra or layers and minimal edge-transitive 3-periodic nets, and (ii) illustrate the potential of the SBB and SBL approaches as a rational pathway for the design and construction of 3-periodic MOFs.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.  Hence, one of the important challenges going forward is to find ways to pack MOFs efficiently without serious damage or to synthesize MOFs that can withstand substantial mech. pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtV2msbrN&md5=23f9bfad78f204569f0bf7c902d42dca", "17.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.  Assocd. with each net is a natural tiling, which is a natural partition of space into space-filling tiles.  The database allows export of data that can be used to analyze and illustrate such tilings.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXht1SgsrjF&md5=392c624f403dd8457460a7649aa496f3", "21.

Here, we briefly discuss high-pressure adsorption measurements and review efforts to develop metal-org. frameworks with high methane storage capacities.  To illustrate the most important properties for evaluating adsorbents for natural gas storage and for designing a next generation of improved materials, six metal-org. frameworks and an activated carbon, with a range of surface areas, pore structures, and surface chemistries representative of the most promising adsorbents for methane storage, are evaluated in detail.  High-pressure methane adsorption isotherms are used to compare gravimetric and volumetric capacities, isosteric heats of adsorption, and usable storage capacities.  Addnl., the relative importance of increasing volumetric capacity, rather than gravimetric capacity, for extending the driving range of natural gas vehicles is highlighted.  Other important systems-level factors, such as thermal management, mech. properties, and the effects of impurities, are also considered, and potential materials synthesis contributions to improving performance in a complete adsorbed natural gas system are discussed.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhvVGntLvE&md5=05a99cd7be9ef1819aca42d1c36f1f1d", "28.

Oxygen isotherms up to 30 bar were measured at multiple temperatures to determine the isosteric heat of adsorption for oxygen on each MOF by fitting to a Toth isotherm model.  High pressure (up to 140 bar) oxygen isotherms were measured for HKUST-1 and NU-125 to determine the working capacity of each MOF.  Compared to the zeolite NaX and Norit activated carbon, NU-125 has an increased excess capacity for oxygen of 237% and 98%, respectively.
