The hallmark of MOFs is their permanent porosity, which is frequently found in MOFs constructed from metal-clusters.  These clusters are often formed in situ, whereas the linkers are generally pre-formed.  The geometry and connectivity of a linker dictate the structure of the resulting MOF.  Adjustments of linker geometry, length, ratio, and functional-group can tune the size, shape, and internal surface property of a MOF for a targeted application.  In this crit. review, the authors highlight advances in MOF synthesis focusing on linker design.  Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, mol. recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described.

Here, the authors report a general method capable of converting such neutral frameworks directly into cationic ones with concurrent generation of mobile anions.  The authors' method is based on the differential affinity between distinct metal ions with framework anionic species.  Specifically, Al3+ was used to strip F- anions away from framework Cr3+ sites, leading to cationic frameworks with mobile Cl- anions.  The subsequent anion exchange with OH- further leads to a porous network with mobile OH- anions.

The clean Cu2O surface assists in the formation of the ZIF-8 coating layer and is etched off spontaneously and simultaneously during this process.  The yolk-shell nanostructures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, SEM, X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen adsorption.  To study the catalytic behavior, hydrogenations of ethylene, cyclohexene, and cyclooctene as model reactions were carried out over the Pd@ZIF-8 catalysts.  The microporous ZIF-8 shell provides excellent mol.-size selectivity.  The results show high activity for the ethylene and cyclohexene hydrogenations but not in the cyclooctene hydrogenation.

A metal-org. framework (MOF), chromium(III) terephthalate (MIL-101), possesses several unprecedented features such as a mesoporous zeotype architecture with mesoporous cages and microporous windows, a giant cell vol., huge surface area, and numerous unsatd. chromium sites.  The presence of unsatd. Cr(III) sites in MIL-101 provides an intrinsic chelating property with electron-rich functional groups.  This feature offers a powerful way to selectively functionalize the unsatd. sites in the MOFs, differing in many respects from the functionalization of mesoporous silica and other porous hybrids reported so far.  This work demonstrates that the surface amine-grafting undoubtedly provides a general way of selective functionalization of porous MOFs besides that with unsatd. metal sites.  The present approach indeed ensures the development of functionalized MOFs for the immobilization and encapsulation of org. mols. and metal components that are useful for catalysis, adsorption, mol. recognition, and so on.  Here some of the recent ideas concerning site-selective functionalization of MIL-101 are examd. and explained, focusing on the utilization of unsatd. Cr(III) sites.

This provides a useful probe for coordination nos. in clay minerals, gels, glasses or material with unknown Al-coordination no.  Six-fold aluminum yields a large variety of XANES features which can be correlated with octahedral point symmetry, no. of aluminum sites and distribution of Al-O distances.  These three parameters may act together, and the quant. interpretation of XANES spectra is difficult.  For a low point symmetry (1), variations are mainly related to the no. of Al sites and distribution of Al-O distances: pyrophyllite, one Al site, is clearly distinguished from kaolinite and gibbsite presenting two Al sites.  For a given no. of Al-site (1), variations are controlled by changes in point symmetry, the no. of XANES features being increased as point symmetry decreases.  For a given point symmetry (1) and a given no. of Al site (1), variations are related to second nearest neighbors (gibbsite vs. kaolinite).  The amplitude of the XANES feature at about 1566 eV is a useful probe for the assessment of AlIV/Altotal ratios in 2/1 phyllosilicates.
