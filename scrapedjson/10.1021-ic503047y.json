An extensive body of research results currently exists from the synthesis of metalorg. frameworks (MOFs), an area that has attracted widespread attention due to the facility with which well-defined mol. building blocks can be assembled into periodic frameworks and the promise that such a process holds for the logical design of materials.  The synthesis of MOFs generally involves the copolymn. of org. links and metal ions in a polar solvent under mild temps. (up to 200\u00b0) and autogenous pressures (up to 100 atm).  Since most products can be considered kinetically driven and lie on local thermodn. min., factors such as soly. of the org. link and metal salt, solvent polarity, ionic strength of the medium, temp. and pressure play crit. roles in detg. the character of products.  Indeed, slight perturbations in synthetic parameters were the basis for the prepn. of what seems to be a flood of new MOF compds.  In the spirit of this discussion the authors advance the following ideas and developments that the authors believe contribute to the maturity of the field: (I) a conceptual framework that unifies the processes involved in the designed synthesis of MOFs, and which can be extended to other materials with extended structures; (II) a thesis concerning the possible structures that may form from building blocks with various shapes; (III) important considerations for achieving the design and synthesis of frameworks in which it is possible to change chem. functionality and metrics without changing the underlying framework topol.; (IV) the inevitability of porosity for designed structures and some factors affecting framework stability; (V) insights on catenation:interpenetration vs. interweaving, forbidden catenation, and duals.

A redn. of 42% of the hydrogen permeability coeff. was obtained when a mixt. of 10/90 vol.% H2/CO2 was used as feed gas.  Accordingly H2/CO2 selectivity decayed from a value of 4.2 calcd. from pure gas permeabilities to 2.7 when permeation data were obtained in mixed gas expts.  The preferential sorption of CO2 on the Langmuir sites of the excess free vol. portion of the polymer allowed explaining and quantifying this phenomenon.  The \"dual-mode sorption, partial immobilization\" model was used to describe H2 and CO2 permeation behavior of pure, binary, ternary and quaternary mixts.  The model sorption parameters for N2 and CO2 in the polymer Matrimid 5218 were obtained from the literature meanwhile those for H2 and for CO were unknown and resulted from the fitting of the exptl. data to the proposed model.  Satisfactory agreement between predicted permeability results and exptl. data with a correlation coeff. (R) higher than 0.95 and mean squared relative error (MSRE) lower than 0.01 was attained.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from large point sources such as power plants is one option for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions; however, currently the capture alone will increase the energy requirements of a plant by 25-40%.  This review highlights the challenges for capture technologies which have the greatest likelihood of reducing CO2 emissions to the atm., namely postcombustion (predominantly CO2/N2 sepn.), precombustion (CO2/H2) capture, and natural gas sweetening (CO2/CH4).  The key factor which underlies significant advancements lies in improved materials that perform the sepns.

Vapor pressures of liquids and solids can be expressed by the equation p = AT\u03b3e-b/t, p being the pressure in baryes, A, b and \u03b3 being consts.  Trouton's rule is equiv. to postulating \u03b3 = 0 and A = a universal const.  Published vapor-pressure data for 20 elements give log A a value of 10.65 \u00b1 1.19.

The existence of monatomic and polyatomic adsorbed films is worked out by means of the Clausius virial for mols. that repel as dipoles.  By use of Gibbs' equation for the adsorption isotherm the rate of evalm. can be obtained in terms of \u03b8, T and M, the dipole moment.  These equations combined with those of Boltzmann and of Saba permit ealcn. of the rate of evapn. of electrons and of ions from surfaces that agree with exptl. data.

Its structure, characterized by single-crystal XRD anal., consists of connections of ZnO2(OH)2 tetrahedra corner-sharing with ZnO4(OH)2 octahedra.  Two adjacent ZnO2(OH)2 tetrahedra have a common edge corresponding to hydroxy groups, which is also linked to the octahedrally coordinated zinc atoms with a \u03bc3 configuration.  This resulting connection mode generates infinite chains running along the c-axis, and connected to each other via the bdc ligand.  A three-dimensional framework is therefore formed with channels running along the c-axis, parallel to the infinite Zn-OH-Zn chains.  Within the tunnels are trapped the DEF species, which interact via hydrogen-bonds to the \u03bc3-hydroxy of the zinc chains with the terminal oxygen atoms of the formamide function.

However, these isotherms are primarily useful for simulating data collected at a fixed pH value and cannot be easily adapted to simulate pH-dependent adsorption effects.  Therefore, most adsorption studies currently use numerical surface-complexation models (SCMs), which are more complex and time consuming than traditional anal. isotherm models.  In this work, we propose a new anal. isotherm model, identified as the modified Langmuir-Freundlich (MLF) isotherm, which can be used to simulate pH-dependent adsorption.  The MLF isotherm uses a linear correlation between pH and affinity coeff. values.  We validated the proposed MLF isotherm by predicting arsenic adsorption onto two different types of sorbents: pure goethite and goethite-coated sand.  The MLF model gave good predictions for both exptl. and surface complexation-model predicted datasets for these two sorbents.  The proposed anal. isotherm framework can help reduce modeling complexity, model development time, and computational efforts.  One of the limitations of the proposed method is that it is currently valid only for single-component systems.  Furthermore, the model requires a system-specific pH. vs. affinity coeff. relation.  Despite these limitations, the approach provides a promising anal. framework for simulating pH-dependent adsorption effects.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XjtFKru74%253D&md5=32bd5950b486796120d201c55e08b7b1", "42.

Multitemperature isotherms were modeled using the Dubinin-Astakhov equation to obtain useful thermodn. properties including adsorption potential characteristic curves and isosteric heats of adsorption.  Results are compared with mesoporous carbons and silicas.  Large-pore materials exhibit relatively high heats of adsorption for CO2 when open metal sites are present.  This phenomenon is not obsd. for methane, which indicates the importance of the CO2 quadrupole in influencing binding strength.  Adsorption results for N2 and O2 show that selectivities in MOFs can be manipulated by the presence or absence of open metal sites.  UMCM-1 and MOF-177 show a slight preference for O2 over N2.  However, open metal site MOFs such as Cu-BTC show the opposite adsorption preference, which is similar to zeolite selectivities.
