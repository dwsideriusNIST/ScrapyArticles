They are typically small and exhibit little or no branching. This is in stark contrast to optimal GSA linkers, which were typically found to be long and with a high degree of branching.", "(19)", " This contrast can be rationalized as follows. GSA (gravimetric surface area) is maximized when a high surface area is achieved with a small mass. Therefore, as few metal SBUs as possible are desired. Increasing the size of the constituent organic linkers serves to improve GSA, and framework interpenetration, which adds SBUs, is a negative agent. By contrast, VSA (volumetric surface area) is maximized when a high surface area is achieved in a small volume. Whether the surface area arises from organic linkers or metal SBUs is irrelevant; the only concern is the optimal occupation of a given volume with framework surface that is exposed to a guest molecule (in this case, methane). Hence, framework interpenetration can be intrinsically beneficial to VSA. Indeed we observe that optimal MOFs for both ", "pcu", " net versions exhibit interpenetration. It is interesting that, in general, ", "tbo", " benefits from interpenetration but that the overall best ", "tbo", " MOF is noninterpenetrated; it is clear however from inspecting the optimal shape that it achieves the highest VSA by virtue of being as small in size as possible (hence for this net, the volume can be sufficiently minimized such that a higher VSA is achieved than could be achieved through maximizing surface area). In summary, the optimal linkers will typically be those which are of short length, so as to minimize framework volume. Second, optimal linker shapes will maximize surface area in a manner which is dependent on the net in question, by either a) being comprised of simplistic rodlike shapes if the net interpenetrates (both ", "pcu", " versions and ", "tbo", " nets that involve branching) or b) maximally occupying the available volume with rings and branching if the net does not interpenetrate (all other nets).", "Therefore it is clear that expanding the bounds of linker complexity is in most cases not necessary for improved framework VSA. The notable exception is the ", "pts", " net, which exhibits a nontrivial improvement in VSA when linkers from set III are permitted. For noninterpenetrating nets such as ", "pts", ", case b) above suggests that complex linkers may yield improved VSA if more efficient occupation of volume is thereby achieved. Indeed the optimal pts linker from set III exhibits this property, since it is small in size but exhibits a shape reflecting wide fused ring sections, increasing surface area without a corresponding increase in framework volume (see Figure ", "9", "). This effect is not observed in the other noninterpenetrating nets, ", "fof", " and ", "ntt", "; however, this can also be rationalized by observing that the optimal VSA linker shapes from set I already exhibit branching on the central junction so as to maximize surface area without increasing volume. In these cases, the additional linker breadth permitted in sets II and III is not of benefit, since any further increase in breadth would cause adjacent linkers in the net to be too close to one another, leading to a decrease in surface area.", "WVF (van der Waals volume fraction) is, to some extent, a similar framework property to VSA. A high WVF is achieved for MOFs exhibiting a minimized proportion of framework volume which is not adjacent to the surface of the material. Therefore, high WVF can be achieved independently of the amount of framework volume; the only concern is that the volume is occupied efficiently with space that is close to the surface so as to maximize the potential for guest\u2013host interaction. Hence, interpenetration also benefits WVF, and, overall, interpenetrated frameworks are found to be superior in every case (note that the above-mentioned case of the optimal VSA ", "tbo", " net not being interpenetrated is not relevant here, since minimizing volume is of no importance).", "It is interesting to note that in each case, optimal linkers for achieving high WVF do not include branches. This behavior can be rationalized by considering that although branching on linkers serves to improve surface area, it can reduce the volume fraction which is close to the surface, by a) explicitly removing space by occupying it with atoms of the linker; b) implicitly removing space by causing it to become inaccessible to the guest due to proximity of linker atoms; or c) requiring an overall increase in linker length to accommodate the branches, which causes an increase in total framework volume and hence a reduction in volume fraction near to the surface.", "Since WVF represents the fraction of void space within a favorable carbon-methane interaction range, it is an approximation of the true favorable methane interaction volume fraction, since the materials in this work are not entirely comprised of carbon. However, it is presented as a reasonable approximation due to the prevalence of carbon-based linkers in the real molecule projections presented herein and in MOFs, in general, and the small degree of difference in the Dreiding force field", "(28)", " between methane interaction with carbon and other common elements such as oxygen and nitrogen.

Projecting optimal abstract linkers back to real molecules and calculating the VSA or WVF of the resulting frameworks is therefore of critical importance in verifying the observations that have been made in the abstract space. However, since abstract molecules are only geometric shapes, and possess no chemistry, there is therefore a broad scope for assigning real chemistry to the optimal geometry. For certain geometric shapes it may not be possible to exhaustively analyze all feasible chemistry with a similar geometry; furthermore, the abstract geometry may be quite distinct from any realistic chemistry.", "We have projected the optimal abstract molecules for each topology and objective function onto real molecules. In the absence of an automated technique known to the authors for evaluating this projection while a) ensuring symmetry of the projected molecules and b) constraining the projection to molecules comprising the desired elements, this evaluation is performed manually for the small number of highest-performing abstract molecules. Accordingly, we do not guarantee that the presented real molecules constitute the closest possible matches to the given geometry. First, linkers of similar geometry to the abstract blueprints but exhibiting only carbon and hydrogen atom backbones were constructed. By restricting linker projection in this way, we achieve the simplest possible chemistry, at the potential expense of geometric proximity to the abstract design. Second, alternative linkers were constructed which were permitted to contain nitrogen atoms within the backbone. This small additional degree of flexibility in linker projection allows for more precise tuning of linker shape to reflect localized features of the identified optimal geometry. For simplicity of the resulting projections, no additional chemical complexity was permitted. Optimal hydrocarbon backbone linkers for the ", "pcu", " (two linkers) and ", "ntt", " nets are illustrated in Figure ", "10", " and Figure ", "11", ", with optimal linkers for the remaining nets presented in the ", "Supporting Information", "; in the cases where nitrogen-containing molecules produced MOFs exhibiting a greater VSA or WVF, these molecules are also presented. The overall best VSA or WVF of projected molecules is compared to that of abstract frameworks in Figure ", "12", ". We would like to note at this point that the undertaken manual projection approach could be replaced in the future by adapting techniques developed in different contexts, for example, design of structure directing agents.", "(32)", "Figure 10.

Maximum abstract VSA (left) and WVF (right) compared to projected molecules (set I).", "It can be observed that, in general, projecting from abstract blueprints to real chemistry has a small impact on the calculated VSA or WVF. The maximum deviation in objective function observed between abstract and real frameworks is for the ", "pcu", " net optimized for VSA (projection causing a 15.9% reduction in VSA), followed by the ", "tbo", " net also for VSA (10.9% reduction). In the case of these two frameworks, the poor VSA following projection can be attributed to unrealistic geometry of the abstract molecules arising from their small size and the discrete nature of real chemistry. The abstract ", "pcu", " linker with optimal VSA is simply a rodlike shape, of a particular length that is between one and two acetylenes; the best projection is to a double acetylene, which causes a relative increase in framework volume and hence a reduction in VSA. However, it should be noted that this does not affect the ranking of the topologies and is still a high VSA. The abstract ", "tbo", " linker is of a similar shape but with a trigonal center; no real chemistry of this size exists within the explored limits of projection, and so the closest achievable molecule comprises a ring. In all other cases, projection resulted in less than 10% deviation in objective function.", "In certain cases, the incorporation of nitrogen atoms permitted a closer geometric match between real and abstract molecules. For instance, the ", "pts", " net linker optimized for VSA exhibits rings of a challenging geometry. The simplest projection is onto benzene rings; however, the substitution for nitrogen on the two atoms of each ring closest to the center, and the corresponding removal of hydrogen, leads to a closer geometric match to the abstract design. A similar effect is observed for several other nets and enables nitrogen-containing projections to achieve higher objective function values.", "Finally, we discuss the behavior of the optimization algorithm, specifically, whether our approach is sufficient to identify a global maximum, and why the maximum achievable objective function is sometimes observed to decrease upon permitting more complex linkers.", "As discussed, gradient-based optimization does not guarantee convergence to a global maximum. Based on the position in parameter space at which optimization is initialized, only convergence to a particular local maximum can be guaranteed. By performing optimization for each objective function, topology, etc. ten times, we aim to mitigate this effect and increase the likelihood of identifying a global maximum. In order to estimate the probability of achieving the global maximum after ten runs, we performed a test whereby a much larger number of runs were performed for four distinct optimizations. We selected the ", "ntt", " net, set III (most complex linkers, presenting a larger search space), and performed 100 runs for each objective function, on linkers which a) permitted no branching and b) permitted branching on the central junction only.

VSA (above) and WVF (below); no branching (left) and branching on the central junction only (right).", "These four optimizations serve to illustrate that the range of VSA or WVF achieved can vary significantly between runs. For example, in the best case, 23 runs optimizing VSA for the ", "ntt", " net with no branching result in 2488.68 m", "2", " cm", "\u20133", ", the maximum achieved; in the worst case, only one optimization of the same net for WVF with branching achieves the maximum of 0.1536. The probability of achieving a particular maximum within ten distinct runs can therefore be estimated. In the worst case, the probability of the best result out of ten random runs being within five percent of the maximum achieved in 100 runs is 82.5%.", "While linker complexity set I is contained within set II, which itself is contained within set III, Table ", "4", " indicates that the maximum WVF achieved for the ", "pcu", " (two linkers) net decreases as linker complexity is permitted to increase. This counterintuitive behavior can be attributed to poorly converged optimization. By permitting increased linker complexity, the search space of possible linkers expands. Accordingly, with a larger search space, it is less likely that ten runs will be sufficient to identify the global maximum. Nevertheless, in these cases the decrease in objective function observed is very small, and the maximum observed in set I can be considered as a lower bound for that of set II, etc.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Conclusions", "References", "4 Conclusions", "In summary we have presented a gradient-based algorithm for the design of MOFs with tailored properties using mathematical optimization. Our approach involves abstracting MOF linkers as space-filling abstract shapes, the geometric properties of which are optimized in order to iteratively improve the properties of the resulting frameworks. We have demonstrated that such a high-level view of MOF design enables 1) optimal linker shapes to be identified by efficiently navigating the space of possible MOF geometries; 2) the maximum VSA and WVF of distinct framework topologies to be easily compared; 3) understanding of the situational benefit of linker design considerations such as branching, fused rings, and overall linker size; and 4) estimation of the maximum achievable framework properties within specified bounds of linker exploration.", "Furthermore, we have illustrated specific MOF design considerations that are correlated with framework properties of interest. MOFs exhibiting an optimal volumetric surface area (VSA) are achieved through either a) interpenetrated frameworks (where permissible) comprised of small, rodlike linkers, thereby minimizing overall volume, or b) noninterpenetrated frameworks comprised of relatively short linkers which include rings and a degree of branching, thereby maximizing surface area. In contrast, an optimal volume fraction close to the internal surface of the material (van der Waals volume fraction, or WVF) is achieved with interpenetrated frameworks (where permissible), and an increase in volume fraction near to the surface through inclusion of rings, but no branches. We note that both versions of the ", "pcu", " net are consistently the highest performing topologies, even in the cases where projecting from abstract to real chemistry causes a decrease in the calculated objective function, and correspondingly the ", "ntt", " net is consistently the lowest performing topology.", "Finally, we emphasize that the approach presented here is general in its utility and can readily be deployed to investigate the optimal linkers for any MOF topology, within any arbitrary bounds of linker complexity, and for any material property of interest.", " ", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Conclusions", "References", "Supporting Information", "Illustrations of metal SBUs, nets, and example abstract linkers are provided in a supporting document.

Org. ligands are abstracted by geometrical (alchem.) building blocks, and an optimization of their defining geometrical parameters is performed to identify shapes of ligands which maximize gravimetric surface area of the resulting MOFs.  A strength of this approach is that the space of ligands to be explored can be rigorously bounded, allowing discovery of the optimum ligand shape within any criteria, conforming to synthetic requirements or arbitrary exploratory limits.  By modifying these bounds, one can project to what extent achievable surface area increases when moving beyond the present limits of org. synthesis.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem.

Unlike zeolites, the channel linings can be chem. functionalized; for example, the aqua ligands can be replaced by pyridines.

Thus all bond distances are derived from at. radii, and there is only one force const. each for bonds, angles, and inversions and only six different values for torsional barriers.
