(GTL) interest now is in Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis of hydrocarbons.  While synthesis gas (syngas) for GTL can be produced from any carbon-based feedstock (hydrocarbons, coal, petroleum coke, biomass), the lowest cost routes to syngas so far are based on natural gas.  Thus, the focus for GTL has been largely on assocd. gas, so-called stranded or remotely located gas reserves, and larger gas reserves that are not currently being economically exploited.  The principal technologies for producing syngas from natural gas are: catalytic steam methane reforming (SMR), two-step reforming, autothermal reforming (ATR), partial oxidn. (POX), and heat exchange reforming.  The distinguishing characteristics of these technologies and their com. uses are discussed.  Ongoing R&D efforts to develop lower-cost syngas generation technologies are also briefly discussed.  Relevant com. experience with large-scale syngas generation for GTL is also discussed.  As a frame of ref., in terms of syngas flow rates, a 20,000 b/day F-T plant would be comparable to three 2500 mt/day methanol plants.  Single-train methanol plants are now producing more than 2500 t/day-and plants approaching 3000 mt/day have been announced.  The projected relative economies of scale of the various syngas prodn. technologies indicate that two-step reforming and ultimately, ATR, should be the technologies of choice for large-scale GTL plants.  Nevertheless, for a 20,000 b/day F-T liqs. plant, capital charges still dominate the manufg. costs.  Syngas prodn. (oxygen plant and reforming) comprises half of the total capital cost of this size GTL plant.  While air-blown reforming eliminates the expensive oxygen plant, air-blown reforming is unlikely to be competitive with, or offer the flexibility of, oxygen-blown reforming.  The reasons for this conclusion are discussed.  The proposed and future GTL facilities should be substantially less costly than their very expensive predecessors-as the result of improvements in FT catalyst and reactor design, the most significant of which have been pioneered by Sasol.  In the absence of a breakthrough technol., economy of scale will be the only significant mechanism by which GTL can achieve greater economic viability.  However, even with such further cost redns., the economic viability of GTL plants will remain confined to special situations until crude price levels rise substantially.  In the long term, if a ceramic membrane reactor (combining air sepn. and partial oxidn.) can be developed that enables the 20% redn. in GTL investment costs that the R&D effort is targeting, GTL could become economically viable at crude prices below US20/b.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXjsFWmsr8%253D&md5=8a1a573841e975f57ee68d651e01e2b6", "3.

The gas obtained is cleaned up and its compn. adjusted in terms of the ratio CO/H2 considering a bypass, a PSA system and water gas shift reaction.  Next, the removal of CO2 and H2S is performed using absorption in monoethanolamines and PSA.  Once the syngas is prepd., the Fischer-Tropsch reaction is conducted and the products sepd.

The optimal soln. requires the use of indirect gasification followed by steam reforming.

A purifn. step by pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is carried out usually using activated C and 5A zeolite as adsorbents.  The design of this process requires fundamental information about the adsorption and diffusion of the components of SMR-off gas, which is only available in the literature for a limited no. of adsorbents.  Adsorption Henry's law consts. and reciprocal diffusion time consts. were measured for H, CO, methane, and CO2 on BPL 4X10 activated C and 13X zeolite pellets from pulse expts.  Adsorption isotherms of these gases in both adsorbents at 298 - 338\u00b0K, up to pressures of 20 bar for H and 2-5 bar for the other gases, also were measured volumetrically.  A PSA cycle for H purifn. using BPL activated C and 13X zeolite was designed introducing the measured adsorption and diffusion data in a simulation tool.  The process can yield 99.99+% H with 90% recovery and 7.2 mol H2 kg-1 h-1.  If 13X zeolite is replaced by 5A zeolite with the same operating conditions, the H purity falls down to 99.81%.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXlslChug%253D%253D&md5=3c8ee9b7935b16531fb0f68b6777738c", "9.

The results of singe gas permeation show a decreasing permeance in an order of H2 > CH4 > N2 > CO2, suggesting that the diffusion and adsorption properties make significant contributions in the gas permeation through the membrane.  In binary gas permeation, the NH2-MIL-53(Al) membrane shows high selectivity for H2 with sepn. factors of 20.7, 23.9 and 30.9 at room temp. (288 K) for H2 over CH4, N2 and CO2, resp.  In comparison to single gas permeation, a slightly higher sepn. factor is obtained due to the competitive adsorption effect between the gases in the porous MOF membrane.  Addnl., the NH2-MIL-53(Al) membrane exhibits very high permeance for H2 in the mixts. sepn. (above 1.5 \u00d7 10-6 mol/(m2\u00b7s\u00b7Pa)) due to its large cavity, resulting in a very high sepn. power.  The details of the temp. effect on the permeances of H2 over other gases are investigated from 288 to 353 K.  The supported NH2-MIL-53(Al) membranes with high hydrogen sepn. power possess high stability, resistance to cracking, temp. cycling and show high reproducibility, necessary for the potential application to hydrogen recycling.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XmslKmsrY%253D&md5=f169f2c7151629ef56cc58c49c924233", "42.
