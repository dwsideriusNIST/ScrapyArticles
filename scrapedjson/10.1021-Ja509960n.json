One of the most effective methods to solve this problem is to convert the surface of MOFs from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Herein, we develop a general strategy to modify hydrophobic polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) on the surface of MOF materials to significantly enhance their moisture or water resistance by a facile vapor deposition technique. MOF-5, HKUST-1, and ZnBT as representative vulnerable MOFs were successfully coated by PDMS, and these coated samples well inherited their original crystalline nature and pore characteristics. Strikingly, the surface areas of these MOFs were nearly 100% retained upon PDMS-coating. Such a coating process might render MOFs applicable in the presence of water or humidity in extended fields such as gas sorption and catalysis."], "text": ["Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have become a well-known class of porous solids, which are constructed by the adjustable assembly of metal ions or metal clusters with multifunctional organic ligands.", "(1)", " MOFs can be rationally designed and prepared to afford desired versatile applications, such as gas storage,", "(2)", " small molecule separation,", "(3)", " catalysis,", "(4)", " sensing,", "(5)", " etc. Although MOFs have shown potential applications in diverse fields, unfortunately, stability has being recognized as a major barrier to limit their practical applications.

On the other hand, to improve the stability of water-sensitive MOFs, the functionalization with hydrophobic surface is an effective solution.", "(9)", " Several strategies have been explored to reduce/avoid the contact between water molecules and MOF host frameworks to enhance their moisture/water resistance.", "(9)", " Despite improving the stability of MOFs toward water or humidity, these approaches suffer from their respective limitations, such as reduced porosity, tedious procedure, complex instrumentation, etc. Therefore, it is imperative, but challenging, to develop a facile and general approach to the improvement of moisture/water stability for the MOFs that are moisture sensitive while possessing potential applications, to push forward their practical use. To this end, the porosity preservation for the MOFs is of prime importance upon moisture/water stability improvement.", "Herein, we report our discovery on a general and effective approach by using a facile polydimethysiloxane (PDMS)-coating treatment", "(10)", " to form a protective hydrophobic layer on the surface of MOFs for improving their moisture/water stability (Scheme ", "1", ") while retaining their intrinsic properties (i.e., high surface area, pore texture, and crystalline structure). Significantly, these PDMS-coated MOFs exhibit highly hydrophobic behavior and excellent moisture/water tolerance as well as well retained inherent porosity. To demonstrate the universality of this PDMS-coating approach, three representative MOFs based on three different secondary building units (SBUs), MOF-5 with Zn", "4", "O(COO)", "6", " clusters,", "(6)", " HKUST-1 with paddle wheel Cu", "2", "(COO)", "4", " centers,", "(11)", " and [Zn(bdc)(ted)", "0.5", "]\u00b72DMF\u00b70.2H", "2", "O (denoted ZnBT hereafter) with pillared square-grid Zn", "2", "(COO)", "4", "N", "2", " clusters,", "(12)", " have been chosen for detailed investigation. Upon PDMS coating, these MOFs exhibit retained crystalline structures and a highly porous feature under moisture/water conditions. It is important to note that the all coated MOFs show nearly intact porosity and unaltered surface area, which are crucial to many applications of MOFs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves the moisture/water resistance with intact porosity via a post-treatment approach [see Table S1 in ", "Supporting Information", " (SI)]. In addition, we have demonstrated the coated MOFs exhibit great performance in CO", "2", " sorption and heterogeneous catalysis after moisture treatment.", "Scheme 1. Illustration of PDMS-Coating on the Surface of MOFs and the Improvement of Moisture/Water Resistance of MOFs", "Typically, the coating process has been conducted by heating MOFs in the presence of some PDMS stamp in a sealed glass container at 235 \u00b0C, and such a temperature is acceptable for most MOFs (usually stable up to 300 \u00b0C). The volatile and low-molecular-weight silicone molecules, which come from the thermal degradation of PDMS, would deposit on the surface of MOFs and subsequently cross-link, to result in the formation of a hydrophobic silicone coating.", "(10)", " After cooling down to room temperature, the coated MOFs would be obtained.", "It is well-known that MOF-5, HKUST-1, and ZnBT are all water sensitive in varying degrees, and they are hydrophilic materials with water contact angles close to 0\u00b0. Compared to the pristine MOFs, all PDMS-coated samples exhibit water contact angles 130 \u00b1 2\u00b0, revealing their hydrophobic character (Figure ", "1", "a\u2013f). The highly hydrophobic behavior of these coated MOFs remains unchanged for a long time. For instance, the coated HKUST-1 is able to float on water for three months or even longer (", "Figure S1", "). In order to verify the presence of the PDMS coating layer, element distribution using a composition line-scan profile has been conducted for coated MOF-5 (Figure ", "1", "g\u2013h). The results indicate that a small amount of Si element uniformly exists on the crystal and the Si/Zn atom ratio is \u223c4.1%, inferring that the PDMS has been successfully coated on the MOF surface. The flat Si distribution in Figure ", "1", "h is attributed to a large scan range (to micrometer) while the thickness of the PDMS coating layer is in nanometers. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image clearly presents an \u223c10 nm PDMS coating layer on the MOF surface, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results indicate that the Si/Zn ratio in the edge (24.6%) is significantly higher than that of the area away from the edge in coated MOF-5 (2.6%) (", "Figure S2", "). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for pristine and coated MOFs have been investigated, and the binding energy of Cu 2p in HKUST-1 exhibits an obvious shift after PDMS coating, revealing the possible bond formation between the unsaturated Cu centers and O atoms from the PDMS layer (", "Figure S3", ").

As shown in Figures ", "2", " and ", "3", ", the morphology, structure, and porosity of all the samples were monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM, power X-ray diffraction (XRD), and N", "2", " adsorption studies, respectively. SEM images show that pristine MOF-5 crystals have regular cubic morphology and a smooth surface (Figure ", "2", "a). However, they underwent serious corrosion with full of cracks and cavities caused by water molecule attack, after staying in a humid environment for 2 days (Figures ", "2", "b). In sharp contrast, the coated MOF-5 exhibits the identical morphology and smooth surface before and after the 2 day treatment in a humid environment (Figure ", "2", "d\u2013e). From powder XRD results, the pristine MOF-5 has been partially transformed to nonporous MOF-69c", "(13)", " in a humid environment for \u223c2 h, accompanied by the appearance of a characteristic peak at 8.9\u00b0 and the weakening of the peak at 9.7\u00b0. Upon further exposure to air for 2 days, the powder XRD patterns of MOF-5 have almost completely disappeared, revealing the destruction of the initial structure (Figure ", "2", "c and ", "2", "f). In contrast, the framework and crystallinity of coated MOF-5 remain unaltered after the same treatment. N", "2", " sorption results are in good agreement with the above morphology and structure investigations (Figure ", "3", "a\u2013b). The BET surface area (", "S", "BET", ") for pristine and coated MOF-5 are calculated to be 3118 and 3159 m", "2", "/g, respectively (", "Table S1", "), suggesting that the inherent porous structure is not collapsed or blocked after the cross-linked silicone molecules covered the surface of pristine MOF-5.

For pristine HKUST-1, the blue powder turns to physical mixture of whitish and pale blue flocs after soaking (", "Figure S1", "), and SEM images show the change from regular octahedral to rod-shaped crystals (", "Figure S4", "), suggesting possible structural transformation. The assumption has been well supported by N", "2", " sorption and powder XRD studies. N", "2", " sorption exhibits its nonporous nature of the water-soaked sample, which totally loses characteristic peak of HKUST-1 (Figure ", "3", "c\u2013d), as demonstrated by powder XRD (", "Figure S5", "). In contrast, the green coated HKUST-1 floats on water with unchanged color as long as 3 months due to its hydrophobicity (", "Figure S1", "). In addition, both SEM images and powder XRD profiles present the same results for coated HKUST-1 before and after water treatment. Further characterization by N", "2", " adsorption shows the ", "S", "BET", " of coated HKUST-1 is 1544 m", "2", "/g, which is as same as that of pristine HKUST-1 (1547 m", "2", "/g, ", "Table S1", "). As expected, the porosity and ", "S", "BET", " of coated HKUST-1 is completely retained after water treatment, in good correlation with SEM and powder XRD results. In addition, water sorption has been investigated for HKUST-1 before and after PDMS coating and results show lower sorption capacity and much slower sorption kinetics for coated HKUST-1 (", "Figure S6", "). Although different structures and metal clusters from MOF-5 and HKUST-1, all characterizations for pristine and coated ZnBT treated in 55% humidity environment explicitly lead to similar results that the structure of pristine ZnBT rapidly collapse and thus loses its porosity in 1 day, while the PDMS coating can guarantee ZnBT remained morphology and structure as well as high porosity under the same humid conditions (Figures ", "3", "e\u2013f ", "and S7\u2013S8, Table S1", "). It should be noted that PDMS coating might only occur to the exterior MOF powder without any shielding, so the coated MOF-5 and ZnBT on the glass dish without perturbation were directly transferred into temperature humidity incubator for moisture-resistant investigation.", "Figure 3.

As expected, the CO", "2", " uptakes for all coated MOFs at 273 and 298 K are nearly closed to those of pristine MOFs (", "Figure S9, Table S2", "). After moisture/water treatment, CO", "2", " uptake capacities of coated MOF-5, HKUST-1, and ZnBT show almost constant values from 39.5 to 38.8 cm", "3", "/g, from 175.3 to 180.1 cm", "3", "/g, and from 109.9 to 106.1 cm", "3", "/g in 760 mmHg at 273 K, respectively. However, all pristine MOFs almost lose their CO", "2", " uptake capacity due to the attack of water molecules.", "Based on the above results, the PDMS coating layer on the surface of MOFs would not affect the accessibility of pores and active sites on the framework of MOFs. Given that the exposed Cu(II) centers in HKUST-1 could act as Lewis acid sites for heterogeneous catalysis,", "(14)", " we then explored the influence of water vapor treatment for a liquid phase cyanosilylation of benzaldehyde and trimethylsilylcyanide (TMSCN) over the pristine and coated HKUST-1. Both MOFs were preactivated in high vacuum at 393 K to remove coordinated water molecules to release the Lewis acid sites. The reaction was carried out at 333 K in heptane for 48 h, and the products were determined by GC analysis. The pristine HKUST-1 showed good selectivity (99%) and yield (48.2%). However, its catalytic activity sharply decreased (yield to 19.6%) after saturated water vapor treatment at room temperature for only 2 min because some exposed Cu(II) sites were recoordinated by water molecules. The activity of coated HKUST-1 (yield to 50.1%) is similar to that of the pristine one, suggesting the permeability of the PDMS coating layer for the substrates. Remarkably, the coated HKUST-1 has retained activity after the same treatment (yield to 49.1%), indicating that the PDMS coating layer can effectively prevent the entrance and coordination to the exposed Cu(II) sites from water molecules and thus protect the catalytic activity of the coated MOF.", "All the above results suggest that the PDMS-coating process could be a universal technology to modify the thin hydrophobic PDMS layer on the surface of MOFs, which can suffer from heat treatment at 235 \u00b0C. Compared with other postmodified methods, such a PDMS-coating approach not only is facile but also shows significant superiority to retain inherent porosity (", "Table S1", "). The ", "S", "BET", " of PDMS-coated MOFs exhibit nearly 100% retainment of the porosity of the original MOFs, while the other reported ways more or less lead to decreased ", "S", "BET", ". More importantly, the coated PDMS layer significantly promotes the moisture/water resistance of these unstable MOFs, which is an indispensable ability and prerequisite for practical applications in the presence of moisture or water. The results of CO", "2", " sorption and heterogeneous catalysis clearly state that PDMS coating would make MOFs well preserved performances in gas storage and catalysis under practical humid conditions.", "In summary, we have reported a new general strategy to modify the surface of MOFs with a thin hydrophobic PDMS layer via a simple thermal vapor deposition technique. The PDMS-modified MOFs exhibited significantly enhanced stability of the framework against degradation toward moisture/water. Remarkably, the PDMS-coated MOFs have well retained porosity and surface area, as well as the active sites that are accessible to substrates during the catalytic reaction, possibly due to the good permeability nature of the thin PDMS layer and/or incomplete MOF surface coating. Such a facile and general strategy would open a new avenue to moisture/water stable MOFs or MOF composites for practical applications.", " ", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "References", "Supporting Information", "Detailed experimental section for material synthesis, characterization, and measurements.

Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.

An intense turn-on emission was observed on incorporation of a class of aromatic compounds, and the resulting luminescent colour was dependent on the chemical substituent of the aromatic guest.

This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.
