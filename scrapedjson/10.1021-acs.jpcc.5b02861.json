The modified materials keep the porous structure of the pristine framework while the presence of the chloride ions leads to a partial blocking of the tetrahedral micropores.

The same values of the heat of adsorption and the same trend of their plots against amount adsorbed have been observed for all three materials. We suggest two reasons for this: the greater degree of homogeneity of the different adsorption sites toward CH", "4", " and the higher average level of its heat of adsorption which make the effect of the anion composition indistinguishable.

This contribution is dedicated to a short overview on the utilization of fluorine for the prepn. of cryst. microporous frameworks including different families of solids: zeolites, metal phosphates and metal-org. frameworks (MOF-type).  Beside the silicates compds., this presentation is focused on the different types of fluorinated aluminum or gallium phosphates hydrothermally obtained in the presence of org. structure-directing agent or templates.  The structural features of aluminum fluorides synthesized with amines are also detailed as well as the influence of fluorine in the synthesis of the metal-org. frameworks involving trivalent metals.  The role of fluorine is described for the hydrothermal synthesis of the different classes of materials.  Fluorine is known for playing the role of mineralizing agent and favors the formation of well cryst. phases.  The use of HF modifies the pH of the reaction which allows for the insertion of addnl. metallic cations on the mineral network.  From the structural point of view, fluoride anions can be located within small cavities of the 3D framework and interactions with metals T (T = Si, Al, Ga, ...) are often obsd., resulting in the coordination change (from tetrahedral unit TO4 to trigonal bipyramid TO4F or octahedron TO4F2).  Several configurations are found for fluorine and it seems to favor the stabilization of the specific cubane-like building unit (D4R) in which it is trapped or participate in the coordination sphere of the metal atoms with bridging or terminal bondings.  In general, new three-dimensional topologies with extra-large pores are obtained.  The synthesis of purely aluminum fluorides with structure-directing agents is considered but only mol. or low-dimensional structures (chain-like or layered) compds. have been described.  Fluorine is also used as a mineralizing agent for the prepn. of well cryst. porous aluminum or chromium carboxylates and it was obsd. to partly substitute the aquo ligands in the giant pores of the compd.

A metal-org. framework (MOF), chromium(III) terephthalate (MIL-101), possesses several unprecedented features such as a mesoporous zeotype architecture with mesoporous cages and microporous windows, a giant cell vol., huge surface area, and numerous unsatd. chromium sites.  The presence of unsatd. Cr(III) sites in MIL-101 provides an intrinsic chelating property with electron-rich functional groups.  This feature offers a powerful way to selectively functionalize the unsatd. sites in the MOFs, differing in many respects from the functionalization of mesoporous silica and other porous hybrids reported so far.  This work demonstrates that the surface amine-grafting undoubtedly provides a general way of selective functionalization of porous MOFs besides that with unsatd. metal sites.  The present approach indeed ensures the development of functionalized MOFs for the immobilization and encapsulation of org. mols. and metal components that are useful for catalysis, adsorption, mol. recognition, and so on.  Here some of the recent ideas concerning site-selective functionalization of MIL-101 are examd. and explained, focusing on the utilization of unsatd. Cr(III) sites.

The atomistic structures of MIL-101 are constructed from exptl. crystallog. data, energy minimization, and quantum mech. optimization.  The adsorption isotherm of CO2 predicted from mol. simulation agrees well with expt. and is relatively insensitive to the method (Merz-Kollman or Mulliken) used to est. the framework charges.  Both the united-atom and five-site models of CH4 predict the isotherm fairly well, though the former overestimates and the latter underestimates.  Adsorption 1st occurs in the microporous supertetrahedra at low pressures and then in the mesoscopic cages with increasing pressure.  In the dehydrated MIL-101, more adsorbate mols. are located near the exposed Cr2 sites than the fluorine satd. Cr1 sites.  The terminal water mols. in the hydrated MIL-101 act as addnl. interaction sites and enhance adsorption at low pressures.  This enhancement is more pronounced for CO2 than for CH4, because CO2 is quadrupolar and interacts more strongly with the terminal water mols.  At high pressures, however, the reverse is obsd., as the presence of terminal water mols. reduces free vol. and adsorption.

In an attempt to understand adsorption characteristics of this framework, pure gas adsorption properties of CO2 and CH4 along with C3H8, SF6, and Ar were measured at three temps. 283, 319, and 351 K using a std. gravimetric method.  The adsorbates were chosen based on their phys. characteristics such as polarizability and quadrupole moment.  Dual site Langmuir (DSL) isotherm proved to be useful for modeling adsorption of gases on this type of materials that are known to have heterogeneity.  Active metal centers and sites inside the pores of supertetrahedra act as major locations for adsorption.  Anal. of enthalpy of adsorption using the DSL model revealed that, for all gases, it initially decreases with loading and remains const. thereafter.  For all gases considered, the enthalpies of adsorption are lower than those on purely siliceous zeolite such as silicalite, suggesting that only moderate interaction exists between the gas and the MIL-101 framework.
