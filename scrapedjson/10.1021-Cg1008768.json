Crucially, the modular construction of MOFs allows the architecture and chemical functionality of the micropores to be precisely controlled, leading to some remarkable properties.

The acute character of the O18\u2212M1\u2212O19 and O18B\u2212M1\u2212O19B angles, as imposed by the steric requirements of the chelating carboxylate groups, results in a highly distorted octahedral coordination environment about M1.

Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation studies indicate that higher H capacities are possible for covalent org. frameworks (COFs).  Currently, the max. isosteric enthalpies of adsorption of \u223c13 kJ/mol at 77 K were obsd. for metal-org. framework materials and this is higher than for COFs, where the max. predicted from GCMC simulations is \u223c8 kJ/mol.  Metal-org. framework materials have structural diversity and scope for modification of surface chem. to enhance H surface interactions.  The synthesis of MOFs with stronger H2-surface interactions to give similar H capacities at much higher temps. than 77 K is required and eventually, materials that have these high capacities at ambient temps. with rapid adsorption/desorption characteristics are necessary for applications as H storage materials for transport applications.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.  Assocd. with each net is a natural tiling, which is a natural partition of space into space-filling tiles.  The database allows export of data that can be used to analyze and illustrate such tilings.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXht1SgsrjF&md5=392c624f403dd8457460a7649aa496f3", "35.
