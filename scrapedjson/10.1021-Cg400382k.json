Uncontrolled massive release of the primary greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) into atm. from anthropogenic activities poses a big threat and adversely affects our global climate and natural environment.  One promising approach to mitigate CO2 emission is carbon capture and storage (CCS), in which ideal adsorbent materials with high storage capacity and excellent adsorption selectivity over other gases are urgently needed.  For practical applications in CO2 capture from flue gas of power plants, the biggest single contributor of anthropogenic CO2 emission, the adsorbent materials must also be chem. stable, be easy to regenerate with minimal energy input, and be easily synthesized with low capital cost.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), highly cryst. porous materials constructed by metal ions and org. ligands, have emerged as a class of excellent adsorbent materials for carbon capture.  Great progress in MOF materials for CO2 capture has been made in the past and reviewed accordingly, but new discoveries are constantly being made as the field quickly grows.

This approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the no. of order Natoms3 operations.  In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme.  A special \"metric\" and a special \"preconditioning\" optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced.  Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calcns.  It will be shown that the no. of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size.  Altogether an order Natoms2 scaling is found for systems contg. up to 1000 electrons.  If we take into account that the no. of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms.

Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature.  However, despite many applications, std. general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional \"hard\" matter such as metals, ionic compds., and insulators are lacking.  Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and mols. on the surfaces of solids.  Here we calc. the lattice consts., bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring.  We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice consts. in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers.  However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to av. errors which are similar to those of PBE or better.  Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs.

The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coeffs. and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles.  The coeffs. for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations.  System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination nos. (CN).  They are used to interpolate between dispersion coeffs. of atoms in different chem. environments.  The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each d. functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of at. forces.  Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered.  The method has been assessed on std. benchmark sets for inter- and intramol. noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems.  The mean abs. deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 std. d. functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version.  Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems.  The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coeffs. also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface.  For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding.

Two classes of substituted benzene mols. were considered: (i) with halogen substituents (tetrafluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, and dibromobenzene) and (ii) with Me substituents (mono-, di-, and tetramethylbenzene).  In the benzene-CO2 complex, the main interaction is between the delocalized \u03c0 arom. system and the mol. quadrupole of CO2.  Halogen substituents have an electron-withdrawing effect on the ring which destabilizes the \u03c0-quadrupole interaction.  Weak \"halogen-bond\" and hydrogen bondlike interactions partially compensate for this, but not to the extent that any significant enhancement of the intermol. binding energy is obsd.  Me groups, on the other hand, have a pos. inductive effect which strengthens the CO2-arom. interaction by up to 3 kJ mol-1 in the case of tetramethylbenzene.  Weak hydrogen bondlike interactions with Me H also contribute to the stability of the complexes.

Three typical ZIFs with different functionalized linkers are considered: ZIF-68 with bIM linker (C6H6 group), ZIF-69 with cbIM linker (chlorine group), and ZIF-78 with nbIM linker (nitro group).  Compared to bIM linker, the charge distributions of cbIM linker and nbIM linker were significantly changed by the substitution of the functional groups and have pos. effects to enhance the binding capacity of CO2.  The withdrawal of electronic charge from the linker leads to enhanced acidity for the hydrogen atoms on linker, which can form weak hydrogen bond interactions with the oxygen atoms of CO2.  The binding capacity of nbIM linker for CO2 is much higher than those of bIM and cbIM linkers for CO2, which is due to the strong effect of nitro group on polarizing the CO2 mol. and thus enhances the interaction force between them.  The binding energies of CO2 in the IM linkers are within the range of -1.64 to -18.54 kJ/mol, which suggests that the binding belongs to physisorption.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhtVygu7%252FK&md5=fffc9d3437b21be89e4e46aec2c10c3c", "46.
