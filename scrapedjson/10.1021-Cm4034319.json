High-polarity solvents such as water, ethanol, and DMF (dielectric constant = 80.1, 24.5, and 36.7 respectively) can promote dissociation of the organic ligand molecules, increasing the acidity of the reaction mixture. Consequently, the dissolution rate of Cu", "2", "O will significantly exceed the coordination rate. Given the high concentration of Cu", "2+", " in solution and the easy nucleation of HKUST-1, the coordination process will take place predominantly in solution, giving rise to free-standing MOF crystals in the final product. In addition, the highly acidic environment would possibly dissolve the NPs during synthesis, and the high ionic concentration would likely induce NP aggregation. Therefore, to render the heterogeneous nucleation favorable, a less polar solvent, BnOH (dielectric constant = 13), was chosen in this synthetic approach to control the rate of dissolution and solubility of the metal ions.", "Figure 3. TEM images of the reaction product when (a) an ethanol\u2013water mixture (volume ratio 1:1) and (b) DMF were used as the solvent instead of BnOH.", "In addition, it was found that the porous, polycrystalline nature of the Cu", "2", "O shell is of paramount importance for formation of the yolk\u2013shell structure under the proposed reaction conditions. The porous nature of the Cu", "2", "O shell can be observed clearly from the contrast in the TEM images (Figure ", "2", "a), and its polycrystallinity can be inferred from the broadened XRD peaks (Figure S4 in the ", "SI", ", green). As observed from the time evolution study, rapid bulk dissolution of the polycrystalline Cu", "2", "O shell led to complete transformation of the precursor into Cu", "2+", " within a relatively short period of time. Therefore, different from current template methods, no clear MOFs/template interface was observed. This led us to wonder about the possible influence of the dissolution behavior of the oxide shell on the final morphology of the heterostructure. In a comparative experiment, monocrystalline Cu", "2", "O nanocubes of size similar to that of NP@Cu", "2", "O core\u2013shell NPs were used as precursors under identical experimental conditions.

In such a case, ligands had sufficient time to diffuse to the MOFs/Cu", "2", "O interface, and no cavity was observed in the final product. Therefore, relatively rapid, bulk dissolution of the oxide shell in a less polar solvent is required to obtain the yolk\u2013shell petalous heterostructures. The bulk dissolution kinetics of porous Cu", "2", "O in BnOH, while much slower than that in a polar solvent, remained high enough to slightly surpass the coordination kinetics of the ligands. Once a continuous layer of HKUST-1 was wrapped around the Cu", "2", "O shell, Cu ions, which moved faster than ligands, diffused through the MOFs, resulting in a supersaturated layer of metal ions surrounding the core\u2013shell templates.

The yolk-shell nanostructures possess the functions of nanoparticle cores, microporous shells, and a cavity in between, which offer great potential in heterogeneous catalysis.  The synthetic strategy involved first coating the nanocrystal cores with a layer of Cu2O as the sacrificial template and then a layer of polycryst. ZIF-8.  The clean Cu2O surface assists in the formation of the ZIF-8 coating layer and is etched off spontaneously and simultaneously during this process.  The yolk-shell nanostructures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, SEM, X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen adsorption.  To study the catalytic behavior, hydrogenations of ethylene, cyclohexene, and cyclooctene as model reactions were carried out over the Pd@ZIF-8 catalysts.  The microporous ZIF-8 shell provides excellent mol.-size selectivity.  The results show high activity for the ethylene and cyclohexene hydrogenations but not in the cyclooctene hydrogenation.  Different activation energies for cyclohexene hydrogenation were obtained for nanostructures with and without the cavity in between the core and the shell.  This demonstrates the importance of controlling the cavity because of its influence on the catalysis.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xht1ajsr7L&md5=d8caeb0e75ea66b4d107d2db26a6fdd4", "53.

Two models of hierarchical solids are considered: microporous materials in which mesopores are carved out (model A) and mesoporous materials in which microporous nanoparticles are inserted (model B).  Adsorption isotherms for model A can be described as a linear combination of the adsorption isotherms for pure mesoporous and microporous solids.  In contrast, adsorption in model B departs from adsorption in pure microporous and mesoporous solids; the inserted microporous particles act as defects, which help nucleate the liq. phase within the mesopore and shift capillary condensation toward lower pressures.  As far as transport under a pressure gradient is concerned, the flux in hierarchical materials consisting of microporous solids in which mesopores are carved out obeys the Navier-Stokes equation so that Darcy's law is verified within the mesopore.  Also, the flow in such materials is larger than in a single mesopore, due to the transfer between micropores and mesopores.  This nonzero velocity at the mesopore surface implies that transport in such hierarchical materials involves slippage at the mesopore surface, although the adsorbate has a strong affinity for the surface.  In contrast to model A, flux in model B is smaller than in a single mesopore, as the nanoparticles act as constrictions that hinder transport.  By a subtle effect arising from fast transport in the mesopores, the presence of mesopores increases the no. of mols. in the microporosity in hierarchical materials and, hence, decreases the flow in the micropores (due to mass conservation).  As a result, the authors do not observe faster diffusion in the micropores of hierarchical materials upon flow but slower diffusion, which increases the contact time between the adsorbate and the surface of the microporosity.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXosVaqu78%253D&md5=2b65cd8272b1698a95f32cd286e304a6", "55.

Both expts. and simulations show strong inflection characteristics in the adsorption isotherms.  The primary cause of the inflection is due to the strong preference for adsorption within, and in the regions close to the mouths of tetrahedral pockets.  The isotherm inflection has a significant influence on the dependence of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity, D, on the fractional occupancy, Di.  Both IRM expts. and simulations show that the Di-\u03b8i behavior appears to be influenced by the loading dependence of the inverse thermodn. factor 1/\u0393i = dln\u03b8i/dlnpi.  For nC4 and iC4, the Di increase sharply by about one order of magnitude as the occupancy \u03b8i increases from 0 to about 0.2.  This increase is caused by the fact that the diffusion characteristics undergo a transition from being dominated by hops across narrow 4.6 \u00c5 windows at low loadings to hops across large 9 \u00c5 windows for loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell.  For loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell the Di-\u03b8i dependence of nC4 and iC4 is dictated by 1/\u0393i, characteristic of more open channel structures such as FAU zeolite.  For 2MB and neoP, the IRM expts. show evidence of phase transition and except for the region in which this occurs the ETHi follows the occupancy dependence of 1/\u0393i for the entire range of loadings.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhsVSgsr7K&md5=023a2404b5d6c33bca4f44dc237a5b73"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-2/cm4034319/production/images/small/cm-2013-034319_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-2/cm4034319/production/images/small/cm-2013-034319_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-2/cm4034319/production/images/small/cm-2013-034319_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-2/cm4034319/production/images/small/cm-2013-034319_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-2/cm4034319/production/images/small/cm-2013-034319_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-2/cm4034319/production/images/small/cm-2013-034319_0007.gif\">"]}
