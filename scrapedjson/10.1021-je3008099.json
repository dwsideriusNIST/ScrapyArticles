This allows for recovered waste heat to be useful by simply circulating water as both heater and coolant. Such chillers which are easily incorporated into existing plant designs appear to have no environmental impediment on its usage in the next decade.

The volumes of the adsorption and charging cells are calibrated by using a calibrated standard volume (210.9 mL with an uncertainty of 0.2 mL) using helium gas. These volumes are determined by measuring the pressures of the combined volumes at isothermal conditions.

The schematic diagram of the setup is depicted in Figure ", "3", ".

This unit has an uncertainty of 0.1 % of the rated full scale. All of the pressure and temperature readings are recorded by a data logger (Agilent) at 10 s intervals over the entire experiment. A heater tape which is controlled by a thermostat is attached on the capillary tubing to prevent condensation.", "Figure 3. Schematic arrangement of experimental setup.", "Before the experiments, the whole setup is evacuated to an ultimate pressure of 0.005 kPa by a BOC Edwards direct drive vane vacuum pump. During the evacuation, the adsorption cell is maintained over 393.15 K to desorb any residual gas in the cell but below 408.15 K to avoid charring of the adsorbent sample. Helium gas is introduced into the system at regular intervals and then vacuumed out to improve the residual gas removal process. After 24 h of evacuation while keeping valve 2 closed, refrigerant gas is injected into the charging cell from the gas cylinder. After sufficient time for stabilization, ball valve 2 is then opened to allow the gas to be released into the adsorption cell. When the pressure of the gas remains constant within the instrumental error, the pressure and temperature are recorded. Both of these measurements are crucial in calculating the mass of gas adsorbed.

The closed cycle chiller for use in air-conditioning utilizes the silica-gel-water adsorption system.  A cycle-simulation program was constructed to analyze the effect of operating conditions (temps., flow rates and adsorption-desorption cycle times) on cooling output, COP and chiller efficiency (\u03b7 = COP/Carnot COP).  The main advantage of this chiller is that it is operational with smaller regenerating temp. lifts (\u0394Tregen = heat source-heat sink temp.) than other heat-driven chillers.  By cycle simulation, it was shown that the three-stage chiller can be operated with heat sources of 50 and 40\u00b0 in combination with cooling sources of 39 and 30\u00b0, resp.  The simulation results also show that for the chiller to operate effectively, heat sources of 50\u00b0 require cooling sources 35-20\u00b0 (\u0394Tregen = 15\u223c30K), while heat sources of 40\u00b0 need cooling sources in the range of 28-20\u00b0 (\u0394Tregen = 12\u223c20K).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK2MXpt1yqtrk%253D&md5=2e5f78477bdaff647a74dbd6ccb0cec2", "22.
