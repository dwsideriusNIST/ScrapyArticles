The clusters react with cobaltous ions in aq. soln. to ppt. the new solid phases [Co2(H2O)4][Re6S8(CN)6]\u00b710H2O (1), Cs2[Co(H2O)2][Re6S8(CN)6]\u00b72H2O (2), and [Co(H2O)3]4[Co2(H2O)4][Re6Se8(CN)6]3\u00b744H2O (3).  The structures of 1\u00b72H2O and 3 were detd. by single-crystal x-ray anal.  The former consists of an expanded Prussian blue type framework with [Re6S8]2+ and [Co2(\u03bc-OH2)2]4+ cluster cores occupying alternate metal ion sites, and features cubelike cages enclosing water-filled cavities \u223c258 \u00c53 in vol.  The latter structure exhibits a network of Co2+ ions and [Co2(\u03bc-OH2)2]4+ cores connected through [Re6Se8(CN)6]4- clusters, defining an array of 1-dimensional channels with min. internal diams. of 4.8 \u00c5.  A Rietveld refinement against x-ray powder diffraction data established compd. 2 as isostructural to an analogous Fe-contg. phase with a two-dimensional framework reminiscent of the Hoffman clathrates.  Thermogravimetric analyses show that all three compds. are fully dehydrated by \u223c100\u00b0, with no further significant loss of mass <500\u00b0.  Upon exposure to di-Et ether vapor, the color of compds. 1 and 3 immediately changes from orange to an intense blue-violet or blue; other polar solvents induce somewhat different colors.  These (reversible) changes are assocd. with the emergence of an envelope of new absorption features at wavelengths between 500 and 650 nm, and the magnitude of the response to a solvent can be estd. by measuring the relative intensity of a band with a max. near 600 nm.  The authors propose that the vapochromic response is due to solvent mols. entering the pores of the solid, where they disrupt the hydrogen-bonded water network, prompting the release of bound water from the [Co2(H2O)4]4+ clusters and conversion of their Co centers from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination.  Significantly, this process does not destroy the three-dimensional connectivity in either structure, but rather creates a much more flexible framework that can expand to accommodate the incoming solvent mols.  Spectroscopic and magnetic data confirm the change in coordination geometry, and the trends in solvent responses (e.g., methanol < ethanol < n-propanol < i-propanol) are consistent with a decreased ability to support the bridging water ligands of the clusters as steric bulk increases.  Size-selective sensing is demonstrated with Me t-Bu ether, which causes a color change in compd. 3, but not in compd. 1.  X-ray powder diffraction expts. indicate that the vapochromic response in both compds. is affiliated with a reversible change in the bulk crystal structure of the material.  Variable-temp. magnetic susceptibility data for compd. 1 suggest a weak antiferromagnetic coupling interaction between the water-bridged Co2+ ions of the dinuclear cluster units.

The influence of the length of the alc. chain (C1-C3) and geometry (1-propanol, 2-propanol) as well as their polarity on the sensing performance was studied, revealing that in dry air, short chain alcs. are more likely adsorbed than long chain alcs., whereas in humid air, this preference is changed, and the sensitivity toward alcs. is generally decreased.  The adsorption mechanism is revealed to differ for dry and humid atms., changing from a site-specific binding of alcs. to the open metal sites under dry conditions to weak physisorption of the analytes dissolved in surface-adsorbed water reservoirs in humid air, with the signal strength being governed by their relative concn.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXpvFCks7k%253D&md5=b741cfadeae123eaf39bde84066bba23", "16.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions/clusters coordinated by org. linkers (or bridging-ligands).  The hallmark of MOFs is their permanent porosity, which is frequently found in MOFs constructed from metal-clusters.  These clusters are often formed in situ, whereas the linkers are generally pre-formed.  The geometry and connectivity of a linker dictate the structure of the resulting MOF.  Adjustments of linker geometry, length, ratio, and functional-group can tune the size, shape, and internal surface property of a MOF for a targeted application.  In this crit. review, the authors highlight advances in MOF synthesis focusing on linker design.  Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, mol. recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described.  Further search for application-oriented MOFs through judicious selection of metal clusters and org. linkers is desirable.  In this review, linkers are categorized as ditopic (Section 1), tritopic (Section 2), tetratopic (Section 3), hexatopic (Section 4), octatopic (Section 5), mixed (Section 6), desymmetrized (Section 7), metallo (Section 8), and N-heterocyclic linkers (Section 9).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXht1Slu7jK&md5=322785c0256204742e3e95e5d2d49914", "26.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.  Assocd. with each net is a natural tiling, which is a natural partition of space into space-filling tiles.
