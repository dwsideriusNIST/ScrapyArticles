Both the equilibrium adsorption characteristics, as well as the dependence of the kinetic behavior on sorbent loading, are different for these two adsorbates. For neon the adsorption isotherms display two steps before reaching the saturated vapor pressure, corresponding to adsorption on strong and on weak binding sites; the isosteric heat of adsorption is a decreasing function of sorbent loading (this quantity varies by about a factor of 2 on the range of loadings studied), and the speed of the adsorption kinetics increases with increasing loading. By contrast, for carbon dioxide there are no substeps in the adsorption isotherms; the isosteric heat is a nonmonotonic function of loading, the value of the isosteric heat never differs from the bulk heat of sublimation by more than 15%, and the kinetic behavior is opposite to that of neon, with equilibration times increasing for higher sorbent loadings.

For neon, a nonpolar adsorbate, the adsorbate\u2013sorbent interaction is considerably greater than the adsorbate\u2013adsorbate interaction (see Figure ", "4", "). Thus, when neon adsorbs on an energetically uniform region of the sorbent, a quasi-vertical step appears in the data (the adsorption energy is a greater portion of the free energy of the particle). In the CO", "2", " case the absence of steps in the adsorption data is the result of the relatively weak attraction between the CO", "2", " molecules and the carbon nanohorns relative to the intermolecular attraction for CO", "2", ". We discuss this point in greater detail in the next section.", "Isosteric Heats", "We used the procedure outlined before to obtain the isosteric heat of adsorption of CO", "2", " on H", "2", "O", "2", "-treated aggregates of nanohorns as a function of sorbent loading. The plot of these data is presented in Figure ", "8", ". As a result of having fewer adsorption isotherms available for carbon dioxide than for neon, our data for the slopes for CO", "2", " have larger error bars: they vary between \u00b110% and \u00b11%.

The horizontal segment at high values of the sorbent loading, indicated by the arrow, corresponds to the bulk latent heat. Unlike the case for neon, the isosteric heat for CO", "2", " is a nonmonotonic function. The overall variation in the isosteric heat is less than \u00b115% of the bulk latent heat.", "The dependence of the isosteric heat of CO", "2", " on loading is remarkably different from the monotonically decreasing function of loading obtained with neon (see Figure ", "4", "). In Figure ", "8", ", we see that the ", "q", "st", " reaches its highest values at the lowest values of the sorbent loading. This corresponds to the occupation of the most strongly binding sites for CO", "2", " on this sorbent. The isosteric heat, then, decreases somewhat (indicating that sites that are less attractive are being occupied), eventually reaching a broad minimum. As the sorbent loading is increased beyond the minimum, the isosteric heat increases with loading until, at the highest levels of loading, this quantity reaches a plateau, at about 270 meV. This value corresponds very well with the bulk latent heat of sublimation for carbon dioxide (271.4 meV).", "(22)", " Evidently, in this higher loading region we are just depositing bulk carbon dioxide on top of the carbon nanohorn aggregates.", "We note that the highest values of the isosteric heat (when CO", "2", " is adsorbing on the strongest binding sites, at low loading) is only approximately 10% larger than the latent heat of sublimation. Furthermore, over a considerably broad region of sorbent loadings, the values of the isosteric heat of adsorption are lower than the latent heat of sublimation. These features are a clear indication of the weak nature of the binding of CO", "2", " to most of the sites present on this sorbent: the attraction of the molecules to the sorbent at moat loadings is smaller than the latent heat of sublimation. The situation is quite different from that in the case of neon, where the sorbent\u2013sorbate attraction is larger than the sorbent\u2013sorbent interactions at all loadings, until saturation is reached.", "The weak attraction between CO", "2", " and other forms of carbon has been previously reported in the literature. In the case of exfoliated graphite, the relatively weak attraction results in the fact that not even a one monolayer CO", "2", " film can form on exfoliated graphite for temperatures below \u2248100 K (the CO", "2", " molecules energetically favor binding to themselves, rather than to the graphite surface) and that no more than one layer of CO", "2", " can form on graphite at any temperature.", "(14)", " This behavior is due to the fact that CO", "2", " has a strong quadrupole moment and that the molecule\u2013molecule attraction is stronger as a result of the quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interactions.", "(34)", " Weak interaction between CO", "2", " and bundles of closed nanotubes has also been reported: the value of the isosteric heat of adsorption at low surface loadings (a measure of the binding to the sorbent) was lower than the value of the energy corresponding to saturation.", "(13)", " We had reported a similar absence of sharp features in the isotherm data for the case of CO", "2", " adsorption on closed nanohorns and a weak value for the highest binding energy for CO", "2", " on aggregates of closed nanohorns.", "(12)", "One of our goals in exploring CO", "2", " adsorption on aggregates of open nanohorns was to determine whether the accessibility of the open pores at the interior of individual nanohorns resulted in the presence of pores having a higher binding energy for this sorbent than that which is present in other carbon adsorbents.

We have found different adsorption equilibrium, as well as different adsorption kinetics, behavior for these two adsorbates on the open nanohorns.", "For neon, the aggregates of open nanohorns provide binding sites with, roughly, two different binding energies. This manifests itself in the adsorption isotherms as two steps in the adsorption data (before the saturated vapor pressure is reached). We have tentatively identified the stronger binding sites as corresponding to both the pore-like spaces in the inter-nanohorn spaces in the aggregates (which are roughly conical) and to the intra-nanohorn spaces in the region near the horns. The weaker binding sites correspond to the external surfaces of individual nanohorns, away from the conical regions, and to the intra-nanohorn spaces away from the horns. The isosteric heat of adsorption for neon is a decreasing function of sorbent loading. This quantity starts on the strongest binding sites at values approximately twice that of the bulk latent heat and decreasing toward the bulk latent heat value as the sorbent loading increases. By contrast, for carbon dioxide the isotherms do not show any steps. The isosteric heat of adsorption for carbon dioxide is a nonmonotonic function of sorbent loading that has a broad region of loadings for which the isosteric heat is smaller than the bulk latent heat. The isosteric heat for carbon dioxide is within \u00b115% of the bulk value of the latent heat at all sorbent loadings.", "The observed differences between the behavior of these adsorbates are perhaps even more dramatic for the adsorption kinetics: while for neon the equilibration times decrease as the sorbent loading increases, exactly the opposite occurs for carbon dioxide.", "We explain the observed difference in behavior in the equilibrium thermodynamic data as resulting from the difference in the respective ratios of adsorbate\u2013adsorbate to adsorbate\u2013sorbent interactions for these two adsorbates. Neon corresponds to the case of adsorption on a strong sorbent (i.e., adsorbate\u2013sorbent interaction higher than adsorbate\u2013adsorbate). By contrast, owing to a strong quadrupole moment, carbon dioxide is a case of weak sorbent interactions. The source of the difference in kinetic behavior for these two adsorbates is not clear at this time. We speculate that it is also probably related to the difference in the ratio of adsorbate\u2013adsorbate and adsorbate\u2013sorbent interactions, as the difference in the size of these adsorbates does not appear to be sufficient to explain the opposite dependence of the adsorption kinetics on sorbent loading.", "The authors declare no competing financial interest.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results for Neon", "Results for CO", "2", "Conclusion", "References", "Acknowledgment", "A.D.M. acknowledges the National Science Foundation for support of this research through Grant DMR-1006428.", "Reference QuickView", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results for Neon", "Results for CO", "2", "Conclusion", "References", "References", "This article references 34 other publications.", "1.

These mixts. have been studied at several pressures, up to 12 MPa.

The bundle formed by [5,4] SWNTs (nanotube diam. of 6.2 \u00c5) can be regarded as a threshold value.  Below that value the densification of hydrogen or methane is negligible.

A no. of solvents have been proposed for CO2 capture from post-combustion flue gas streams.  Currently, the solvents furthest along in development are aq. amine solns., stemming from nearly a century of use and know-how developed within the natural gas industry.  Of these, monoethanolamine (MEA) is perhaps the most well-known, thoroughly studied, and readily available, yet likely cannot meet the stringent energy and cost limitations required to economically achieve 90% CO2 capture at coal-fired power plants.  Also in development are piperazine (PZ) and several hindered and \"advanced\" amines, which show great potential to improve energy efficiency and stability, but are not yet produced on a scale approaching that of MEA.  Many other novel solvents have also been proposed, but few have been taken beyond bench-scale activities.  Eventually, as CO2 capture processes are broadly deployed worldwide, the solvent(s) with the most favorable economics and performance will need to be manufd. in annual quantities of 1 Mton or greater, effectively creating at least one new chem. of global industrial importance.  With the ultimate goal of deep redns. in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in mind, the processes by which chems. for CO2 capture are manufd. should also be considered in terms of their energy requirements, efficiencies, waste products, and CO2 emissions.  This review begins to address some of these tech. and economic questions by examg. the manuf. of several amines that have been proposed for post-combustion CO2 capture, as well as the fundamental building block of all amines, ammonia.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xht1SqsLfM&md5=aa82a2ec643b278409838945be034107", "11.

The presence of sites with different binding energies introduces specific paths of adsorption, as particles use the weaker binding sites as temporary intermediate states before being adsorbed on stronger binding sites.  This mechanism greatly increases the adsorption rate of the stronger sites with two main consequences as compared with our previous results for homogeneous surfaces: (1) the time evolution of the coverage is nonexponential, and (2) the overall equilibration time as a function of coverage deviates from the linear dependence.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXhtFWqtrnF&md5=dc023f054b027fab40bafec182105727", "31.

From the time evolution of the coverage at a fixed temp., equilibration times are obtained as a function of chem. potential (or amt. adsorbed).  The equilibration time of the external phase decreases linearly as the coverage increases toward monolayer completion; the rate at which this occurs strongly depends on the ratio between the binding energy and the temp.  Because of this dependence, unexpectedly long waiting times can be obsd. for very low coverages in systems with relatively high binding energies.  The adsorption rate in pore-like phases is typically 2 orders of magnitude slower than that of external phases.
