X-ray crystallog. characterization reveals that adjacent layers are stacked such that channels are created, except in 5.  The channels form a H-bonded interior for guest mols.; in practice, 1a contains EtOH and H2O mols. as guests in the channels with H bonds, whereas 3b (3a) contains THF (acetone) mols.  In 1a, the double-edged axe-shaped motifs in adjacent sheets are not located over the top of each other, while the motifs in 3b stack so perfectly as to overlap each other in an edge-to-edge fashion.  This subtle change in the three-dimensional framework is assocd. with the template effect of the guests.  Compd. 5 has no guest mols. and, therefore, the amide groups in one sheet were used for H-bonding links with adjacent sheets.  Removal of the guest mols. from 1a and 3b (3a) causes a structural conversion accompanied by a color change.  Pink 1a cannot retain its original framework and changes into a blue amorphous compd.  However, the framework of pink 3b (3a) is transformed to a new cryst. framework of violet 4.  The complex 4 reverts to the original pink crystals of 3b (3a) when it is exposed to THF (or acetone) vapor.  Spectroscopic measurements (visible, EPR, and IR) provide a clue to the crystal-to-crystal transformation; on removal of the guests, the amide groups were used to form the \u03b2 sheet-type H bonding between the sheets, and thus the framework withstands significant stress on removal of guest mols.  This mechanism is attributed to the arrangement of the adjacent sheets so suited in regularity that the \u03b2 sheet-type structure forms efficiently.  The apohost 4 does not adsorb cyclopentane, showing a guest selectivity that, in addn. to size, H-bonding capability is required for the guest mols.

Its 3 D framework is built up of infinite trans chains of corner-sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra.  The chains are interconnected by the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate groups, creating 1 D rhombic-shaped tunnels.  Disordered 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid mols. are trapped inside these tunnels.  Their evacuation upon heating, between 275 and 420\u00b0, leads to a nanoporous open-framework (MIL-53ht (Al) or Al(OH)[O2CC6H4CO2]) with empty pores of diam. 8.5 \u00c5.  This solid exhibits a Langmuir surface area. of 1590(1) m2g-1 together with a remarkable thermal stability, since it starts to decomp. only at 500\u00b0.  At room temp., the solid reversibly absorbs H2O in its tunnels, causing a very large breathing effect and shrinkage of the pores.  Anal. of the hydration process by solid-state NMR (1H, 13C, 27Al) has clearly indicated that the trapped H2O mols. interact with the carboxylate groups through H bonds, but do not affect the hydroxyl species bridging the Al atoms.

A common idea, assocd. with the usual definition of solids, was to consider crystd. solids are rigid edifices, within which the only degrees of freedom were the thermal vibration of the atoms forming the compd. and the movement of atoms during a displacive structural transition.  This implied small displacements of the atoms (0.1 \u00c5 < d < 1 \u00c5).  In 2002, simultaneously with my friend Susumu Kitagawa from Kyoto university,[2-5] we discovered a new behavior of the crystd. solid matter: the unusually large flexibility of cryst. solids (movements of > 5-10 \u00c5), keeping the same topol. in the absence of any amorphous intermediate.  Knowing your continuous curiosity toward new events in solid state chem., I decided to dedicate this tribute to this strange phenomenon, primitively a lab. curiosity but which became during these last ten years a specific topic attracting chemists, physicists, and computer scientists for the academic point of view, but also companies for the applications this behavior allows.

This technique allows us to explore the possible spatial configurations of the CO2 mols. in the MIL-53 systems depending on the size of the pore opening at different loadings.  Our results show that the replacement of the \u03bc2-OH groups by oxo moieties in the MIL-47 material leads to fewer, weaker adsorption sites for CO2 onto the framework itself, whereas a larger no. of CO2 geometries are possible in both the large and narrow versions of MIL-53.  In the narrow pore form, the double interaction, where a CO2 mol. bridges the pore to simultaneously coordinate with 2 \u03bc2-OH groups on opposite sides of a pore wall, was predicted to be the most energetic arrangement at the initial stage of adsorption.  Addnl. configurations include coordination with both inorg. and org. parts of the framework.  When the no. of CO2 mol. increases, our calcns. indicate that the resulting increase in the intermol. interactions between the adsorbate mols. lead to a significant modification of the CO2 arrangement within the pore and should be an important feature in the explanation of the \"breathing\" of this material.  In the large pore form, an interaction reflecting the opening of the pore is not possible, and so the most likely interaction is one where a CO2 interacts with a single \u03bc2-OH group, in a no. of different orientations.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXhsVehtbvI&md5=e2dd8437fd9a0c26d75ded5339e391d6", "22.

AIMD employing dispersion-cor. d. functional theory accurately simulated the exptl. obsd. closure of MIL-53(Sc) upon solvent removal and the transition of the empty MOF from the closed-pore phase to the very-narrow-pore phase (symmetry change from P21/c to C2/c) with increasing temp., indicating that it can directly take into account entropic as well as enthalpic effects.  The authors also used AIMD simulations to mimic the CO2 adsorption of MIL-53(Sc) in silico by allowing the MIL-53(Sc) framework to evolve freely in response to CO2 loadings corresponding to the two steps in the exptl. adsorption isotherm.  The resulting structures enabled the structure detn. of the two CO2-contg. intermediate and large-pore phases obsd. by exptl. synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies with increasing CO2 pressure; this would not have been possible for the intermediate structure via conventional methods because of diffraction peak broadening.  Furthermore, the strong and anisotropic peak broadening obsd. for the intermediate structure could be explained in terms of fluctuations of the framework predicted by the AIMD simulations.

Each type of mols. adsorb preferentially in two different porosities of the material, i.e., while CO2 occupy the tetrahedral cages, CH4 are pushed to the octahedral cages.  Further, a very unusual dynamic behavior was also pointed out with the slower mol., i.e., CO2, enhancing the mobility of the fast one, i.e., CH4, that contrasts with those usually obsd. so far for the CO2/CH4 mixt. in narrow window zeolites where the mols. are most commonly diffusing independently or slowing-down the partner species.  Such behavior was interpreted in light of mol. simulations that evidenced a jump type mechanism involving a tetrahedral cages-octahedral cages-tetrahedral cages sequence that occurs more frequently for CH4 when in presence of CO2.  The consequences in terms of CO2/CH4 selectivity and the possible use of this MOF-type material in a PSA process are then discussed.

The framework structures of Ni2L\u00b78H2O and Ni2L\u00b72H2O are almost identical (R\u203e3, a 27.8342(1), c 6.2421(2) \u00c5; R\u203e3, a 27.9144(1), c 6.1655(2) \u00c5) with addnl. physisorbed H2O of the as-prepd. Ni-STA-12 present in an ordered H-bonded network in the channels.  Ab initio structure soln. of the fully dehydrated solid indicates it has changed symmetry to triclinic (P\u203e1, a 6.03475(5), b 14.9157(2), c 16.1572(2) \u00c5, \u03b1 112.5721(7), \u03b2 95.7025(11), \u03b3 96.4950(11)\u00b0) as a result of a topotactic structural rearrangement.  The fully dehydrated solid possesses permanent porosity with elliptical channels 8 \u00c5 \u00d7 9 \u00c5 in free diam.  The structural change results from the loss of H2O coordinated to the Ni cations, so that the Ni coordination changes from edge-sharing octahedral NiO5N to edge- and corner-sharing 5-fold NiO4N.  During this change, two out of three phosphonate groups rotate to become fully coordinated to Ni cations, leaving the remainder of the phosphonate groups coordinated to Ni cations by two O atoms and with a P=O bond projecting into the channels.  This transformation, which is completely reversible, causes substantial changes in both vibrational and electronic properties as shown by IR, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopies.  Complementary adsorption, calorimetric, and IR studies of the probe adsorbates H2, CO, and CO2 reveal several distinct adsorption sites in the solid, which are attributed to their interactions with Ni cations which are weak Lewis acid sites, as well as with P=O groups that project into the pores.  At 304 K, the adsorption isotherms and enthalpies of adsorption on dehydrated Ni-STA-12 were measured for CO2 and CH4: Ni-STA-12 gives adsorption uptakes of CO2 of 2.5 mmol g-1 at 1 bar, an uptake ca.  10 Times that of CH4.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhtlWqurvN&md5=443bdbd4de665aa6713b6a25fd7ee4a0", "48.
