", "2014", "). Steam cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons is the main source of ethylene and propylene production which produces olefin/paraffin mixtures. These olefins must be separated from the uncracked paraffins to obtain pure olefin for polymer industries, i.e., ethylene\u00a0>99.5\u00a0%, (Lee et al. ", "1997", "; Lamia et al. ", "2007", "). The process of producing pure olefins is difficult due to similar physical properties of olefin/paraffin pairs. Energy intensive cryogenic distillation columns with large number of trays are usually applied for separation of light olefin/paraffin as their relative volatility lies between 1.0 and 1.1 at temperatures of 244\u2013327\u00a0K and total pressures of 1.7\u201322\u00a0bar (Da Silva and Rodrigues ", "1999", ").", "A major reduction in the energy costs of cryogenic distillation is achieved by the use of selective solid adsorbents. A variety of adsorbents have been explored to be applied in these separation processes. Some of them are ethylene selective while the others are ethane selective. Additionally, the adsorption capacity and selectivity of various adsorbents are different making it necessary to find the most appropriate one for a desired process.", "In my recent paper (Maghsoudi ", "2015", "), the performance of all adsorbents (MOFs and zeolites) including 4A, 5A, 13X, DDR, Si\u2013CHA, ITQ-3, ITQ-12, ITQ-32, SAPO-34, Ni-MOF-74, Mg-MOF-74, Co-MOF-74 and CuBTC in propene/propane separation was investigated by binary adsorption calculations. The results revealed that MOFs have higher adsorption capacity (~8\u00a0mmol/g) with a propene/propane equilibrium selectivity of about 10\u201312 at 100\u00a0kPa and 298\u00a0K for a 50/50 binary mixture. On the other hand, all-silica DDR zeolite showed a very high selectivity of more than 1000 with adsorption capacity of about 0.8\u00a0mmol/g. The adsorbents may show different behavior in ethylene/ethane separation. For example, DDR and Si-CHA zeolites are propene selective while they selectively adsorb ethane from ethylene/ethane mixture.", "The main objective of this paper is to do a comparative study between all microporous adsorbents (MOFs and zeolites) regarding their equilibrium adsorption selectivities and capacities in ethylene/ethane separation. That is accomplished by Ideal Adsorption Solution Theory (IAST) at different gas compositions (0.1\u20130.9 ethylene mole fractions) and pressures up to 100\u00a0kPa.", "2 ", "Binary mixture calculations", "The applied method for binary mixture calculations is based on ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) of Myers and Prausnitz (", "1965", ").

Thus, it can be concluded that Fe", "2", "(dobdc) and 5A are the best adsorbents having the highest selectivity and capacity among MOFs and zeolites, respectively.

This figure is a guide for selection of adsorbents, however, the best case can be determined by some economic considerations where the importance of capacity or selectivity should be taken into account. But, generally, it can be stated that AgA and 5A zeolites are more appropriate for membrane applications where the adsorption selectivity is much more important than capacity. On the other hand, the Fe", "2", "(dobdc) is proper for a process where the high adsorption capacity is needed.", "Open image in new window", "Fig.\u00a07", "Ethylene/ethane equilibrium selectivity versus amount adsorbed at 100\u00a0kPa for 50/50 binary mixture", "5 ", "Conclusions", "Binary adsorption of ethylene/ethane mixtures using IAST model led to evaluate the capability of various microporous adsorbents, including zeolites and MOFs, that have been utilized in the literature. Figure\u00a0", "7", " may be a very useful graph that can be utilized for selecting the suitable adsorbent for a specified process. The results revealed that Fe", "2", "(dobdc) have higher adsorption capacity (~5.8\u00a0mmol/g) with a ethylene/ethane equilibrium selectivity of about 14 at 100\u00a0kPa and 298\u00a0K for 50/50 binary mixture. On the other hand, AgA zeolite showed a very high selectivity with adsorption capacity of about 2.3\u00a0mmol/g. Generally, it may be stated that AgA and 5A zeolites are more appropriate for membrane applications where the adsorption selectivity is much more important than capacity. However, the rate of diffusion of adsorbates is another important factor that should be considered but it is not the objective of this paper. On the other hand, the Fe", "2", "(dobdc) is proper for a process where the high adsorption capacity is needed.\n"], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO8\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig1_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig1_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO9\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig2_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig2_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO10\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig3_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig3_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO11\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig4_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig4_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO12\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig5_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig5_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO13\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig6_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig6_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO14\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig7_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-016-9805-x/MediaObjects/10450_2016_9805_Fig7_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>"]}
