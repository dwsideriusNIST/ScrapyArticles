Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.  Because we can functionalize the pores to direct their specific recognition of small mols., the emerging porous MOFs serve as novel functional materials for gas storage, sepn., heterogeneous catalysis, and sensing.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlslyhtrs%253D&md5=f9230905a5656f9fe0e487967ecae356", "(i) ", "Zhou", ", ", "H.-C.", "; ", "Long", ", ", "J.

Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most potent, reversible antiplatelet agents released from the endothelium.  Nitric oxide released from within a polymer matrix has been proven effective for preventing platelet activation and adhesion onto extracorporeal circuits.  However, the critical NO release (NO flux) threshold for thrombus prevention during ECC has not yet been determined.  Using a 4-hour arteriovenous (AV) rabbit model of ECC, we sought to find this threshold value for ECC circuits, using an improved NO-releasing coating (Norel-b).

Hourly blood samples were obtained for measurement of arterial blood gases, platelet counts, fibrinogen levels and platelet function (via aggregometry).  A custom-built AV circuit was constructed with 36 cm of poly(vinyl)chloride (PVC) tubing, a 14 gauge (GA) angiocatheter for arterial access and a modified 10 French (Fr) thoracic catheter for venous access.  The Norel-b coating reduced platelet activation and thrombus formation, and preserved platelet function - in all circuits that exhibited an NO flux of 13.65 x 10(10) mol x cm(-2) x min(-1).  These results were significant when compared with the controls.

Here, the authors summarize recent developments in the investigation of the electronic structures, spectroscopic properties, and reactivities of ferrous and ferric heme-nitrosyls and how this relates to important biol. processes.  Ferrous heme-nitrosyls show interesting variations in electronic structure as a function of the different types of proximal ligands, as is evident from ESR, magnetic CD, and vibrational spectroscopy.  In particular, coordination of imidazoles like histidine (His) increases the radical character on NO and, in this way, could help activate the bound NO for catalysis.  Vice versa, the bound NO ligand imposes a strong \u03c3 trans effect on the proximal His residue, which, in the case of sol. guanylate cyclase (sGC), the biol. NO sensor protein, induces breaking of the FeII-His bond and activates the protein.  The possibility of sGC activation by HNO is also discussed.  Finally, the properties of ferrous heme-nitrosyls with proximal cysteinate (Cys) coordination are evaluated.  It has been known for some time that ferric heme-nitrosyls are intrinsically more labile than their ferrous counterparts, but the underlying reasons for this observation have not been clarified.  New results show that this property relates to the presence of a low-lying excited state that is dissociative with respect to the FeIII-NO bond.  On the other hand, the ground state of these complexes is best described as FeII-NO+, which shows a very strong Fe-NO bond, as is evident from vibrational spectroscopy.  NO, therefore, is a weak ligand to ferric heme, which, at the same time, forms a strong Fe-NO bond.  This is possible because the thermodn. weakness and spectroscopic strength of the Fe-NO bond relate to the properties of different electronic states.  Thiolate coordination to ferric hemes leads to a weakening of both the Fe-NO and N-O bonds as a function of the thiolate donor strength.  This observation can be explained by a \u03c3 backbond into the \u03c3* orbital of the Fe-N-O unit that is mediated by the thiolate \u03c3-donor orbital via orbital mixing.  This is a new interaction in heme-nitrosyl that has not been obsd. before.  This also induces a bending of the Fe-N-O subunit in these cases.  New spectroscopic data on a corresponding model complex are included in this paper.  Finally, the mechanism of NO redn. by cytochrome P 450nor is elucidated based on recent DFT results.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXosVyjsb0%253D&md5=19c0a0454372052de5e8eb78bafe7b80", "(f) ", "Riccio", ", ", "D.

A wide range of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing materials has emerged as potential therapeutics that exploit NO's vast biol. roles.  Macromol. NO-releasing scaffolds are particularly promising due to their ability to store and deliver larger NO payloads in a more controlled and effective manner compared to low mol. wt. NO donors.

The iron centers are highly dispersed in the cryst. matrix and on highly dild. samples, mononuclear and dinuclear structures are expected to become predominant.  The cryst. and robust character of the MFI framework has allowed to hypothesize that the catalytic sites are located in well defined crystallog. positions.  For this reason these catalysts have been considered as the closest and best defined heterogeneous counterparts of heme and non heme iron complexes and of Fenton type Fe2+ homogeneous counterparts.  On this basis, an analogy with the methane monooxygenase has been advanced several times.  In this review we have examd. the abundant literature on the subject and summarized the most widely accepted views on the structure, nuclearity and catalytic activity of the iron species.  By comparing the results obtained with the various characterization techniques, we conclude that Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite are not the ideal samples conceived before and that many types of species are present, some active and some other silent from adsorptive and catalytic point of view.  The relative concn. of these species changes with thermal treatments, prepn. procedures and loading.  Only at lowest loadings the catalytically active species become the dominant fraction of the iron species.

The unusual isomer shifts have been traced to strong valence electron delocalization within the {FeNO}7 unit, whereby some electrons are almost equally shared by metal (i.e., dxz, and dyz) and NO \u03c0* orbitals.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1MXltFSrsL4%253D&md5=acfa44a7cfe5990e4b1f7781b276f330", "18.

[FeII(6TLA)(BF)](ClO4) (1) reversibly binds NO to afford the nitrosyl adduct [Fe(6TLA)(BF)(NO)](ClO4) (3), while [FeII(TPA)(BF)](ClO4) (2) reacts with NO irreversibly to form [Fe(TPA)(BF)(NO)](ClO4) (4).  The difference in the binding affinities of NO for 1 and 2 correlates with the higher redox potential of 1 (+870 mV vs. normal H electrode) relative to that of 2 (+340 mV) and is reflected in the 1H NMR properties of 3 and 4.  Both nitrosyl adducts have an {FeNO}7 configuration based on the Enemark-Feltham nomenclature and exhibit characteristic S = 3/2 EPR signals with axial g values of 4 and 2.  An x-ray diffraction study of 4 reveals a six-coordinate Fe-TPA complex in which the nitrosyl ligand binds trans to the amine N and cis to the monodentate BF ligand.  The Fe-N-O angles in the two crystallog. independent conformational isomers of 4 are 162(2) and 155(2)\u00b0 with Fe-NO bond lengths of 1.70(2) and 1.74(2) \u00c5, resp.

Complexes 3 and 4 exhibit spectroscopic features comparable to those of nitrosyl adducts of several mononuclear nonheme Fe proteins.

Although instability of the terminal iron-oxo moiety is perhaps the foremost obstacle, steric and electronic factors also limit the activity of previously reported mononuclear iron(IV)-oxo compds.  In particular, although nature's non-haem iron(IV)-oxo compds. possess high-spin S = 2 ground states, this electronic configuration has proved difficult to achieve in a mol. species.  These challenges may be mitigated within metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) that feature site-isolated iron centers in a constrained, weak-field ligand environment.  Here, we show that the metal-org. framework Fe2(dobdc) (dobdc4- = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and its magnesium-dild. analog, Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc), are able to activate the C-H bonds of ethane and convert it into ethanol and acetaldehyde using nitrous oxide as the terminal oxidant.
