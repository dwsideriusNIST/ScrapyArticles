Ammonia curves (Figure ", "1", "a) show BSC eluting almost immediately through the beds, reaching capacity in less than 2000 min/g. Ammonia does not begin eluting through CuBTC until after this weighted time. The resulting capacities for CuBTC are approximately 10 times and 5 times greater than that of BSC under dry and humid conditions, respectively. Both materials show better ammonia removal in humid conditions as compared to dry conditions. This is typical, especially for activated carbons because ammonia is absorbed by water within the pore structure.", "BSC arsine curves (Figure ", "1", "b) show steep ascent to the feed concentration under both dry and humid conditions, as does that of the CuBTC material under dry conditions. Of interest, however, is the humid CuBTC curve, which initially breaks through to greater than 60% of the feed, drops back down to approximately 20% of the feed, and then gradually re-ascends to the feed concentration over a long period of time. This behavior is likely attributed to mass transfer resistance or an initial activation requirement for the reaction to occur. In any case, the resulting capacity of CuBTC is significantly higher than that of BSC under both dry and humid conditions.", "The BSC material exhibits a huge capacity for hydrogen sulfide (Figure ", "1", "c) under dry conditions, eluting long after CuBTC at the same humidity. The resulting loading for BSC is 8.7 mol/kg, over double that of CuBTC, which exhibits a loading of 3.4 mol/kg.

Under both low- and high-humidity conditions, CuBTC provides significantly better ammonia removal as compared to the BSC material. This is likely due to activity throughout the CuBTC structure, as previously discussed,", "(12)", " whereas BSC simply contains impregnants on an inert carbon substrate and is underutilized compared to the CuBTC. Furthermore, the humid ammonia curve through CuBTC is flatter than that through BSC, indicating a higher capacity but reduced mass transfer. This correlates well with microbreakthrough data, which showed exceedingly high ammonia capacity of the CuBTC material. The full-bed performance of CuBTC under dry (AR/15) and humid (80/80) conditions is approximately 31\u202f000 and 51\u202f000 mg-min/m", "3", ", respectively, approximately 50% better than BSC, which shows capacities of 20\u202f000 and 34\u202f000 mg min/m", "3", ", respectively. Arsine and hydrogen sulfide breakthrough curves tell a different story, however. Immediate breakthrough of arsine occurs for CuBTC under high-humidity conditions, whereas the BSC material provides excellent removal capabilities. Yet, the material still exhibits significant capacity. Thus, it is apparent that the critical bed depth required to reduce the arsine concentration from 3200 mg/m", "3", " to below toxic levels is just too large. Although the CuBTC curves do show some protection against hydrogen sulfide, the material provides significantly lower protection as compared to the BSC.", "Clearly there exists a discrepancy between the microbreakthrough and scaled breakthrough tests because CuBTC is similar to BSC with regard to capacity but not breakthrough time and Ct.

Changes in the higher-order structure of the bands in the NIR are also noted along with an ammonia peak around 2200 nm. When arsine is added to the CuBTC, there is little change to the overall spectrum. Some additional higher-order structure is seen with the addition of the arsine resulting from the interaction with the MOF. The addition of hydrogen sulfide results in dramatic hyperchromic shift to lower reflectance. This effect is so pronounced that all the reflectance is lost in the NIR with the addition of the hydrogen sulfide.

After low-humidity testing, PXRD data show almost no structural degradation, with major long-range order peaks remaining intact after exposure, with the exception of a new peak around 13.5 2\u03b8. Interestingly, however, several new peaks form at 22.7, 32.5, 55.2, and 59.8 2\u03b8 without an increase in signal-to-noise, perhaps indicating the formation of a new species within the pore structure. Data for samples exposed to arsine under humid conditions show similar peaks forming, with additional structure collapse, as evidenced by the loss of the 7 2\u03b8 peak and increased signal-to-noise. This can be explained by moisture destroying the structure, which is known to occur on the CuBTC. Nitrogen isotherm data confirm this for the humid sample but also show a significant decrease in nitrogen uptake for the dry sample, resulting in surface areas of 12 and 66 m", "2", "/g, respectively. Although the decrease in surface area is explained by moisture exposure for the humid sample, the PXRD data for the dry samples shows that the structure remains intact.

On an atomic basis, as summarized in Table ", "1", ", there are 0.56 As atoms per copper atom under low RH conditions and 0.41 As atoms per copper atom under humid conditions. The formation of arsenic oxide likely partially blocks pore apertures or further access to the copper site, thus explaining the reduced mass transfer kinetics in the packed bed test.

An additional phase is obvious for the humid sample, and both dry and humid samples show reduced signal-to-noise. In conjunction with the nitrogen isotherm data, it is apparent that the structure is collapsing upon exposure to hydrogen sulfide, with reductions in surface area to 48 and 11 m", "2", "/g for low-and high-humidity samples, respectively. Although arsine was completely oxidized within the pore structure, hydrogen sulfide seems to react directly and permanently with the undercoordinated copper site of the SBU.

When considering capacity, CuBTC generally outperforms the carbon, yet the opposite is true for packed-bed breakthrough tests, with the exception of ammonia. This is likely due to mass transfer limitation associated with the larger molecular size of hydrogen sulfide and arsine as compared to ammonia as well as the mechanism of reaction. Ammonia directly interacts with various structural areas of the CuBTC material, including undercoordinated copper sites and structural bonds between the SBU and organic linker. Hydrogen sulfide reacts similarly to the undercoordinated copper sites, but does not undergo the acid\u2013base reaction with SBU/organic linkers. Thus, the capacity is lower for hydrogen sulfide as compared to ammonia on CuBTC, and the reduced kinetics of mass transfer and reaction result in lower packed-bed performance as compared to the activated carbon. Arsine seemingly does not react with any portion of the substrate but rather oxidizes to form arsenic trioxide. Although the capacity is sufficiently high, the combination of arsine size and the formation of these oxides within the pore structure result in significantly reduced performance in a packed bed. In addition to the performance of CuBTC, spectral signatures indicate potential use as sensors, with infrared and UV\u2013vis changes occurring after exposure to all three chemicals.", "Although there are potential shortcomings in protection against arsine and hydrogen sulfide, CuBTC does indeed provide substantial protection against ammonia, and thus any additional chemical removal is beneficial.

If the temp. is moderate (\u2264125\u00b0), the dehydrated CuBTC demonstrates a good hydrostatic stability for water concns. \u22644.0 mols. per copper site.  However, if the temp. increases to 550 K, the dehydrated CuBTC will collapse even at a small water concn., 1.0 H2O mol. per copper site.  When NH3 mols. are adsorbed in the channel and micropores of CuBTC, they prefer to chemisorb to the copper sites rather than forming a dimer with another NH3 mol.  The formation of equimolar Cu2(NH2)4 and (NH4)3BTC structures was obsd. at 348 K, which is in good agreement with previous exptl. findings.  The dehydrated CuBTC framework is partially collapsed upon NH3 adsorption, while the Cu-Cu dimer structure remains stable under the investigated conditions.  Further calcns. reveal that the stability of CuBTC is related to the ammonia concn.  The crit. NH3 concn. after which the dehydrated CuBTC starts to collapse is detd. to be 1.0 NH3 mol. per copper site.

Alvord Hot Spring in southeastern Oregon is a circumneutral hot spring with an av. arsenic concn. of 4.5 mg L-1 (60 \u03bcM).  Hydrogeochem. analyses indicated significant arsenite oxidn., increased pH and decreased temp. along the stream channels flowing into Alvord Hot Spring.  The dynamic range of pH and temp. over the length of three stream channels were 6.76-7.06 and 69.5-78.2 \u00b0C, resp.  Biofilm samples showed As(III) oxidn. ex situ.  16S rRNA gene studies of sparse upstream biofilm indicated a dominance of bacteria related to Sulfurihydrogenibium, Thermus, and Thermocrinis.  The lush downstream biofilm community included these same three groups but was more diverse with sequences related to uncultured OP10 bacterial phylum, uncultured Bacteroidetes, and an uncultured clade.  Isolation of an arsenite oxidizer was conducted with artificial hot spring medium and yielded the isolate A03C, which is closely related to Thermus aquaticus based on 16S rRNA gene anal.  Thus, this study demonstrated the bacterial diversity along geochem. gradients of temp., pH and As(III): As(V), and provided evidence of microbial arsenite oxidn. within the Alvord Hot Spring system.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXktVelu7s%253D&md5=a0be3bcb9e97d5f602b2a41d2d63fe2e", "37.
