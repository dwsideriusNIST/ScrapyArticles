Distinct from the traditional inorganic nanoporous materials, MOFs whose framework structures and chemical composition can be multiply tailored from well-defined molecular building blocks via crystal engineering [", "3", ", ", "4", "]. These materials typically are characterized by ultrahigh porosity, extra-large surface areas, uniform but tunable nanocavities and tailorable chemistry. These characteristics make them be considered as promising candidates to address the current challenges in gas storage [", "5", ", ", "6", "], adsorption [", "7", "] and separations [", "8", "], as well as heterogeneous catalysis [", "9", ", ", "10", ", ", "11", "]. By serving as unique host matrices, incorporation of various functional species into MOFs might afford an new route to develop novel MOFs-based composite materials that display a synergistic combination of properties in comparison to the parent MOFs counterparts [", "12", ", ", "13", "].", "Generally, two main routes could be employed to incorporate functional groups into MOFs: (1) Functionalized MOFs are synthesized directly by joining metal-containing units with functional organic linkers under solvothermal condition [", "14", "]. (2) Post-synthetic modification (PSM) strategy could also been implemented to impart functionality to MOFs depending on their intrinsic chemical and structural characteristic [", "15", ", ", "16", ", ", "17", "]. The former, direct synthesis of functionalized MOFs, will be complicated or altogether thwarted because organic ligands containing functional groups are thermally labile, result in problematic solubility, or can coordinate metal ions. By comparison, PSM strategy should be more straightforward and effective to functionalize MOFs. In this way, rational selection of the robust MOFs (with high thermal and chemical stability) and post-synthetic conditions (e.g. temperature and solvent) would be of paramount importance for the successful implementation of chemical modification. In addition, the newly introduced functional groups must be compatible with the host MOFs material and synthetic methods. Otherwise, these MOFs porous matrices would suffer a setback as a consequence of host\u2013guest interaction.", "Recently, functionalized (task-specific) ionic liquids (TSILs) have attracted increasing attention owning to their unique physicochemical properties, such as low melting points, non-volatile, good thermal stability, favorable solubility and tunability of the cations and anions [", "18", ", ", "19", ", ", "20", "]. The chemical and structural versatility of TSILs make them be potential versatile guest modifiers for improving the targeted properties of various functional materials. In particular, TSILs functionalized porous solid materials as heterogeneous catalysts have inspired different positive effects since they combine the advantages of homogeneous TSILs catalyst with those of porous support materials [", "21", ", ", "22", "], such as synergistic catalysis [", "23", "], good \u201csolubility\u201d of the catalyst [", "24", "], the surface wettability (hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity) of catalyst [", "25", "], facilitating product isolation and catalyst recycling [", "26", ", ", "27", ", ", "28", ", ", "29", "]. Generally, this concept could be realized by coating of TSILs onto surface of desired solid support materials by impregnation or covalent attachment under organic solvent condition. As for this methods, the solubility of ionic liquid in different solvents and their chemical behaviours (e.g. acidity or basicity) would have a profound effect on preparation of supported ionic liquid catalyst. As a consequence, many researchers mainly focused on the investigation of supported ionic liquids catalyst onto the surface of robust inorganic materials (e.g. SiO", "2", ", SBA-15, MCM-41 and carbon material) [", "30", ", ", "31", ", ", "32", ", ", "33", "]. However, very few attempts towards MOF supported ionic liquid have been reported because the chemical stability of MOFs are usually feeble in organic solvent.", "Up to date, several representative robust MOFs have been synthesized like MIL-101 [", "34", "], HKUST-1 [", "35", "], ZIF-8 [", "36", ", ", "37", "], UiO-66 [", "38", "], etc., and these materials are suitable for PSM.

In our group, the acidic ILs and basic ILs functionalized MOF as novel heterogeneous catalyst have been reported. It was found that these catalysts combined the merit of homogeneous ILs organocatalyst with heterogeneous MOFs support [", "40", ", ", "41", "]. Jiang and co-workers reported a TSILs/IRMOF-1 composite for selective CO", "2", " capture from a CO", "2", "/N", "2", " mixture by a computational study. They demonstrated that TSILs/IRMOF-1 composite showed higher selectivity than many other supported ILs due to ions in the composite interact strongly with CO", "2", " [", "42", ", ", "43", "]. Calero et al. investigated RTILs/HKUST-1 hybrid composite for carbon dioxide separation from mixtures containing methane or nitrogen. It was found that ionic liquid embedded in HKUST-1 nanocavities could enhance carbon dioxide adsorption at low pressure [", "44", "]. In addition, Jhung et al. prepared 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloroaluminate acidic ionic liquid supported on MIL-101 by impregnation under dichloromethane solvent. This adsorbent has been shown to be beneficial for adsorptive desulfurization from liquid fuel [", "45", "]. These pioneering works on ionic liquid hybrid MOFs composite materials open interesting possibilities in absorption and heterogeneous catalysis. Nonetheless, there is no intensive study towards effect of ionic liquid on intrinsic MOFs physicochemical properties due to host\u2013guest interaction during PSM conditions.", "In this contribution, we aim to study the effect of chemical behaviours of ionic liquid in different solvents on encapsulation of ionic liquid organocatalyst inside MOFs and their catalytic performances.

The change in the d\u2013d region is commonly because of new available d\u2013d transitions in distorted octahedral local geometry due to a loss of degeneracy in d shell produced by removing H", "2", "O molecules (Jahn\u2013Teller effect).

In the first step, the TGA curve of the pristine HKUST-1 material indicates an initial mass loss at ~100\u00a0\u00b0C due to the adsorbed water or solvent inner and outer surfaces of HKUST-1. The weight loss at >300\u00a0\u00b0C is attributed to the complete collapse of HKUST-1 framework. For all as-synthesized catalysts under different solvents, the initial weight loss is significantly reduced because the original water or solvent molecules are replaced by ABIL group. For ABIL@HKUST-1/Ethanol catalyst, the weight loss at 200\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C could be assigned to the complete loss of the coordination bond anchored ABIL group. In addition, the stable curve from 100 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C indicates that the catalyst is thermally stable below 200\u00a0\u00b0C.

The pristine HKUST-1 as heterogeneous catalyst has a low benzaldehyde conversion (55.3\u00a0%) after 240\u00a0min, which could be probably due to the coordinatively unsaturated metal Cu(II) sites with mild Lewis acidity. The catalytic activity is agreement with the previous reports from Opanasenko et al. [", "55", "]. It is to encourage that all as-synthesized catalysts show increased catalytic activity. The ABIL@HKUST-1/Ethanol catalyst, with intact framework structure, demonstrates excellent catalytic performance after 210\u00a0min (benzaldehyde conversion\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0%, TOF\u00a0=\u00a010.7\u00a0h", "\u22121", ").

Furthermore, EA shows that loading amount of ABIL over all reused catalysts are much higher than fresh catalysts by, as shown in Table\u00a0", "1", ". The most reasonable explanation for this deviant result should be mainly due to the residual reactant and product, which contain nitrogen element and congest catalyst nanocavities.
