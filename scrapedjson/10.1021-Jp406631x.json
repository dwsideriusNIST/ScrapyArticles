The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) provides a tech. and economically credible alternative concept to present day p-n junction photovoltaic devices.  In contrast to the conventional silicon systems, where the semiconductor assumes both the task of light absorption and charge carrier transport the two functions are sepd. here.  Light is absorbed by a sensitizer, which is anchored to the surface of a wide band gap oxide semiconductor.  Charge sepn. takes place at the interface via photo-induced electron injection from the dye into the conduction band of the solid.  Carriers are transported in the conduction band of the semiconductor to the charge collector.  The use of sensitizers having a broad absorption band in conjunction with oxide films of nanocryst. morphol. permits to harvest a large fraction of sunlight.  Nearly quant. conversion of incident photon into elec. current is achieved over a large spectral range extending from the UV to the near IR region.  Overall solar (std. AM 1.5) to current conversion efficiencies of 10.6% have been reached.  New electrolytes based on ionic liqs. have been developed that show excellent stability both under prolonged light soaking and high temp. stress.

TiO2 is the most investigated single-cryst. system in the surface science of metal oxides, and the literature on rutile (1 1 0), (1 0 0), (0 0 1), and anatase surfaces is discussed.  This paper starts with a summary of the wide variety of tech. fields where TiO2 is of importance.  The bulk structure and bulk defects (as far as relevant to the surface properties) are briefly reviewed.  Rules to predict stable oxide surfaces are exemplified on rutile (1 1 0).  The surface structure of rutile (1 1 0) is discussed in some detail.  Theor. predicted and exptl. detd. relaxations of surface geometries are compared, and defects (step edge orientations, point and line defects, impurities, surface manifestations of crystallog. shear planes-CSPs) are discussed, as well as the image contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).  The controversy about the correct model for the (1\u00d72) reconstruction appears to be settled.  Different surface prepn. methods, such as reoxidn. of reduced crystals, can cause a drastic effect on surface geometries and morphol., and recommendations for prepg. different TiO2(1 1 0) surfaces are given.  The structure of the TiO2(1 0 0)-(1\u00d71) surface is discussed and the proposed models for the (1\u00d73) reconstruction are critically reviewed.  Very recent results on anatase (1 0 0) and (1 0 1) surfaces are included.  The electronic structure of stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces is now well understood.  Surface defects can be detected with a variety of surface spectroscopies.  The vibrational structure is dominated by strong Fuchs-Kliewer phonons, and high-resoln. electron energy loss spectra often need to be deconvoluted to render useful information about adsorbed mols.  The growth of metals (Li, Na, K, Cs, Ca, Al, Ti, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) as well as some metal oxides on TiO2 is reviewed.  The tendency to wet' the overlayer, the growth morphol., the epitaxial relationship, and the strength of the interfacial oxidn./redn. reaction all follow clear trends across the periodic table, with the reactivity of the overlayer metal towards O being the most decisive factor.  Alkali atoms form ordered superstructures at low coverages.  Recent progress in understanding the surface structure of metals in the strong-metal support interaction' (SMSI) state is summarized.Literature is reviewed on the adsorption and reaction of a wide variety of inorg. mols. (H2, O2, H2O, CO, CO2, N2, NH3, NOx, sulfur- and halogen-contg. mols., rare gases) as well as org. mols. (carboxylic acids, alcs., aldehydes and ketones, alkynes, pyridine and its derivates, silanes, Me halides).  The application of TiO2-based systems in photo-active devices is discussed, and the results on UHV-based photocatalytic studies are summarized.

The terraces are sepd. by monoat. step edges running predominantly parallel to <001> and <1\u203e11 > type directions.  Approx. half of the <001>-type steps have a kinked appearance that is attributed to a (4\u00d71)-reconstructed step edge.  At. models for auto compensated step edges are presented.  Oxygen vacancies (point defects) in the bridging oxygen rows are created by the high-temp. anneal in UHV.  In STM images, these oxygen vacancies appear as bright features centered on dark rows.  Their d. is 7 \u00b1 3% per surface unit cell and is reduced upon exposure to mol. oxygen at room temp.  Dark features on bright rows are also seen; these are not affected by mol. oxygen and are tentatively assigned to subsurface defects.  Hydroxyl groups from spurious water in the oxygen gas stream are obsd. to adsorb dissociatively at step edges and on the in-plane Ti rows on the terraces.  The appearance of the surface oxygen vacancies depends on the state of the STM tip; asym. tips skew the appearance of the point defects and may even render images where they are invisible.  Tip changes occur frequently, esp. when the surface has been exposed to oxygen, and may lead to images that are hard to interpret.  The \"normal\" tip state where the vacancies appear as bright spots connecting bright rows can be regained reproducibly by scanning with a high (up to + 10 V) tip voltage; the tip is then possibly covered with substrate material.  The oxygen vacancies show strong interactions with the STM tip, i.e. tip-induced oxidn. and mobility.  These interactions depend strongly on the state of the tip, and are enhanced by the presence of oxygen in the ambient.  To explain these effects a model for the tip-induced oxidn. is presented where oxygen atoms hop between the tip and sample.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1cXlvFGnt7Y%253D&md5=904a580fcb40d17fd285497cfca73168", "38.

Ti-MOF-NH2 and Pt/Ti-MOF-NH2 exhibit efficient photocatalytic activities for hydrogen prodn. from an aq. soln. contg. triethanolamine as a sacrificial electron donor under visible-light irradn.  The longest wavelength available for the reaction is 500 nm.  The results obtained from wavelength-dependent photocatalytic tests and photocurrent measurements as well as in situ ESR measurements demonstrate that the reaction proceeds through the light absorption by its org. linker and the following electron transfer to the catalytically active titanium-oxo cluster.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhtlWmur7E&md5=8f62c5d402b008b3eca99b376c402142", "65.

A systematic anal. carried out for further catecholate adsorbates allows one to identify the basic mechanisms that dictate the energy position of the gap states.  The peculiar level alignment is originated from the simultaneous interplay among the specific anchoring group, the backbone conjugation, and the lateral functional groups.
