From results of ab initio calcns. using plane waves [PAW-PBE] and localized AOs [ONIOM(wB97X-D/6-31G*:AM1)], we report strong CO2 adsorption on boron antisite (BN) in boron-rich boron nitride nanotube (BNNT).  We have identified two adsorption states: (1) A linear CO2 mol. is phys. adsorbed on the BN, showing electron donation from the CO2 lone-pair states to the BN double-acceptor state, and (2) the physisorbed CO2 undergoes a carboxylate-like structural distortion and C=O \u03c0-bond breaking due to electron back-donation from BN to CO2.  The CO2 chemisorption energy on BN is almost independent of tube diam. and, more importantly, higher than the std. free energy of gaseous CO2 at room temp.  This implies that boron-rich BNNT could capture CO2 effectively at ambient conditions.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhsVOns7g%253D&md5=fb47bb01e077f95b44a076dd460795a1", "18.

In all of the investigated systems, we found planar layers to represent saddle points on the energy surface, whereas corrugated species were identified as min.  The corrugation source was linked to the repulsion of nitrogen lone pairs in close NN contacts.  A linear dependency of the corrugation energy from the no. of NN interactions in the investigated clusters was found.  Heptazine based systems gain about twice as much energy per NN close contact in comparison to triazine structures which could be understood in terms of the distortion mechanism in the investigated structures.

The LDA-DFT calcns. give a range of shifts for the asym. stretching mode from about -6 to -20 cm-1 for internally bound CO2, and a range from -4 to -16 cm-1 for externally bound CO2 at low densities.  The magnitude of the shift is larger for CO2 adsorbed parallel to the SWNT surface; various perpendicular configurations yield much smaller theor. shifts.  The asym. stretching mode for CO2 adsorbed in groove sites and interstitial sites exhibits calcd. shifts of -22.2 and -23.8 cm-1, resp.

The second family exhibits a shift of about -7 cm-1 and the site location and configuration for these species is ambiguous, based on comparison with the theor. shifts.  The population of the internally bound CO2 may be enhanced by established etching procedures that open the entry ports for adsorption, namely, ozone oxidn. followed by annealing in vacuum at 873 K.

It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6\u00b7R-6.  A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common d. functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported.  The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on std. thermochem. benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked arom. mols. and group II element clusters, and for the computation of mol. geometries.  Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for std. functionals.  In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean abs. deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1.  The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the av. CCSD(T) accuracy.  The basic strategy in the development to restrict the d. functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interat. distances by damped C6\u00b7R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions.  As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference.  From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chem. method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XhtFenu7bO&md5=0b4aa16bebc3a0a2ec175d4b161ab0e4", "63.

NH3 has recently received much attention due to its advantages over other state-of-the-art CO2 capture technol.  Understanding this CO2-capturing mechanism, which has caused controversy, is crucial to further develop advanced CO2 capture technol.  The CO2 conversion mechanism in aq. NH3 was examd. by ab-initio calcns. and kinetic simulations.  Full details of all reaction pathways for the NH3-driven CO2 conversion mechanism are shown, with the pronounced effect of micro-solvation.  NH3 performs multiple roles: reactant, catalyst, base, and product controller.  Carbamic and carbonic acids are formed by the NH3-driven trimol. mechanism.  In micro-solvation, NH3 makes carbamic acid formation kinetically preferred over carbonic acid.  As the CO2 concn. increases, the dominant product becomes carbonic acid.  Conversion from carbamic acid to carbonic acid occurs via the decompn./recombination pathway.  This understanding would be exploited for optimal CO2 capture technol.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXivFCktLw%253D&md5=0fa045a61f8ba700c942bb71985f15fb", "64.

These structures, along with three previously reported GME ZIFs, constitute a series of highly porous materials with Brunauer-Emmet-Teller surface areas ranging from 620 to 1730 m2/g.  The pore diams. and apertures vary incrementally from 7.1 to 15.9 \u00c5 and 3.8 to 13.1 \u00c5, resp., and the functionalities decorating the pores vary from polar cyano- and nitro- groups to nonpolar alkyl groups.  The variability expressed in these materials makes them highly attractive for study as gas-sepn. media.  Selectivity values calcd. for sepn. of CO2 and CH4 predict that the ZIFs with polar functionality, ZIF-78 (10.6:1) and -82 (9.6:1), retain CO2 gas to a greater degree than the other members of the GME series and BPL-activated carbon.
