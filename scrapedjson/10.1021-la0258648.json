Because swelling of the coal organic matrix in the presence of adsorbing gases is a well-known phenomenon and because traditional isotherm models assume a rigid structure, an adsorption isotherm equation was derived to account for the volume effects which may occur when an adsorbate alters the structure of an adsorbent. The equation, which accounts for volume change in general, was applied to the particular example of CO", " adsorption on coal. In some cases, significantly better fits were obtained when the adsorption data were fit to the swelling-modified model. The modified model partitions the experimentally determined adsorption into a surface adsorption term, which is important at lower pressure, and a rectilinear term, related to volume effects, which is important at higher pressures.

However, the adsorption capacity and the stability of the adsorbed CO", "2", ", which can be affected by the nature of the coal itself as well as by environmental factors, need to be accurately known. The adsorption isotherm is one of the most important tools for estimating adsorption capacity. Historically, the adsorption of CO", "2", " on coals has been used to estimate surface areas", "2,3", " and micropore structures of coals.", "4", " Usually, these measurements have been conducted at low pressures (usually below atmospheric) and low temperatures (\u221278 \u00b0C).", "3", " Although information obtained from measurements such as these is important to current sequestration efforts, low-pressure, low-temperature adsorption isotherm data do not represent geologic, in-seam conditions.

", " ", "Coal swelling during the sorption of liquids,", "7", " gases,", "8,9", " and vapors", "10,11", " is a well-known phenomenon. Reucroft et al.", "8,12", " measured the swelling and shrinkage of various", " ranks of Kentucky coal due to the adsorption of gases, such as helium (He), nitrogen (N", "2", "), CO", "2", ", and xenon (Xe), by directly observing directional (length) changes at pressures between 0 and 1.5 MPa. They found that under a vacuum the coal samples shrank, presumably due to moisture loss because the extent of shrinkage was dependent on the amount of moisture removed from the coal. Pressurization with He or N", "2", " compressed the coal and resulted in shrinkage, whereas CO", "2", " caused considerable swelling. The volume increase observed in going from 0 to 1.5 MPa was between 0.36% and 4.18%. They also found that swelling in a CO", "2", " atmosphere was rank dependent with lower-rank coals swelling more than higher-rank coals. Walker et al.", "13", " measured the expansion of powdered coals and macerals induced by gaseous CO", "2", " and methanol (CH", "3", "OH). They found that expansion to an equilibrium value was faster in CO", "2", " than in CH", "3", "OH although significantly greater expansion was observed in CH", "3", "OH. They concluded that most of the CO", "2", " uptake was due to CO", "2", " uptake in open and closed (to He) micropores at the temperatures and pressures used to measure surface areas. Recently, St. George and Barakat", "9", " have investigated volumetric changes of the coal matrix upon the adsorption and desorption of CH", "4", ", CO", "2", ", N", "2", ", and He. Again, compression, rather than swelling, was observed in the presence of high-pressure He. Expansion was observed for the other gases. Expansion in the presence of CO", "2", " was 12 times larger than in N", "2", " and 8 times larger than in CH", "4", ".

Proposed Model.", " The pore structure (or structures) of coal has been the subject of a long-running debate.

This is of particular importance to the development of adsorption isotherms using the volumetric (manometric) technique. All of the volumetric calculations are based on the assumption that the void volume of the sample cell, that is, the volume not occupied by the adsorbent, is accurately determined using He or another \u201cinert\u201d gas. Because of the swelling properties and accessibility problems discussed above, this assumption is questionable in the case of coal and other swelling adsorbents. Unlike previously derived adsorption isotherm models, which are based on a rigid adsorbent structure and constant adsorbent and void volumes, the equation derivation presented here allows the sample-cell void volume to change. ", " ", "2.2.1. Uncertainties in Volume Estimations.", " In addition to swelling behavior of the adsorbent, there are several sources of uncertainty in the volume estimations made in an adsorption isotherm measurement. He is generally used for the estimation of the volume of the solid adsorbent. The selection of He is based on the assumptions that He is not adsorbed and that it can reach the smallest pores so that it reports the \u201ctrue\u201d density of the solid adsorbent.", "21", " If the small molecular size of He allows it to penetrate the smallest pores, then larger, inert molecules that are unable to access all of the pores would report a lower density for the solid adsorbent because part of the He accessible volume would be excluded. This is called the \u201csieving effect\u201d.", "22", " Conversely, He has been reported to adsorb on solid adsorbents at low temperatures and high pressures,", "23,24", " indicating that the measured void volume or the volume of the adsorbent may be more or less in error at other temperatures and pressures. When both molecular sieving and adsorption are present, the apparent density may be higher or lower than that observed in He. Therefore, both assumptions about the behavior of He may result in errors in the estimation of the actual void volume accessible to the adsorbing gas. ", " ", "Another source of volume uncertainty is the change in the volume of the adsorbent due to the compression or the shrinkage of solid adsorbents at high pressures.", "25,26", " This is especially important for porous solids because the calculated volume of the solid may be affected in two opposing ways. First, there is a dimensional change as the solid is compressed at high pressures resulting in a net decrease in sorbent volume. Second, the constriction of pore entrances upon compression may prohibit gas molecules from accessing pores that were accessible initially, resulting in an apparent increase in solid volume. The expansion or swelling of adsorbents considered above may also result in a change in volume. Again, the volume of the solid may be affected in two opposing ways. The dimensional increase as the solid swells results in a net increase in sorbent volume. However, the widening of previously constricted pore entrances may enable more gas molecules to access those pores that were initially inaccessible, resulting in a net decrease in the apparent solid volume. ", " ", "Another source of volume uncertainty is the change in the volume of the adsorbent due to the dissolution of the adsorbing gas. A number of phenomena such as sorption-induced swelling", "12,16", " and diffusion in coals", "22", " have indicated that the coal is an elastic material. The adsorption on coal is often explained with a dual sorption model describing adsorption on the surface and absorption within the coal matrix as two interacting subprocesses.", "5,10,11,27", " Dissolution (diffusion) of the adsorbing gas within the coal matrix may result in a volume change. ", " ", "Another source of volume uncertainty is the change in volume due to the volume occupied by the adsorbed phase.

These terms may be divided into two categories, those that are independent of pressure, such as inaccuracies in the estimation of the void volume, and those that are expected to be pressure dependent, such as the extent of coal swelling. That is, if the volume difference in eq 7 is due to a systematic error, it will be invariant over any pressure range studied, but if the volume change is a function of the pressure, its value will change as the pressure changes. The change in the volume effect term, \u0394", "V", "x", ", or any other equation variable, with CO", "2", " pressure can be obtained by fitting the adsorption isotherm data to eq 7 using increasingly larger ranges of the data.

The change in adsorption capacity depends on the coal rank, and its magnitude depends, to some extent, on the model chosen for ", "n", "abs", ". For the highest-ranked coal, regardless of the exact adsorption model chosen, the adsorption capacity and volume effect are relatively unaffected by increasing pressure. For the lower-ranked coals, the adsorption capacity increases with increasing pressure as the free-", " gas volume (or void volume) in the system decreases with increasing pressure. These trends are consistent with an adsorption mechanism in which the lower-ranked coals swell more than the higher ranks, occupy a portion of the previously available free space, and provide larger areas for surface adsorption. These overall trends are consistent with the extensive literature on the structure and chemistry of coals. However, the quantitative evaluation, especially for the lower-ranked coals, is very model dependent. While all of the model equations shown in Table 1 predict similar adsorbed amounts for the high-rank Pocahontas coal, the Langmuir\u2212Freundlich, Toth, and UNILAN equations predict the adsorption capacities of the low-rank Blind Canyon and Wyodak coals to be 2\u22123 times larger at higher pressures than those reported by the Langmuir, modified BET, and Dubinin\u2212Astakhov equations.

While a larger exponent in the UNILAN equation indicates more heterogeneity, the opposite is true for the Langmuir\u2212Freundlich, Toth, and Dubinin\u2212Astakhov equations. As shown in Figure 10, the exponents indicate an increase in heterogeneity of the surface with increasing pressure for the lower-ranked coals. Again, little change is seen for the high-rank Pocahontas coal, which behaves more like a traditional rigid solid than the lower-ranked coals. For lower-ranked coals, the trend in the exponent indicates that as more CO", "2", " is adsorbed with pressure, the coal swells more and the surface becomes more heterogeneous. Using the exponent in the modified BET equation to determine the number of adsorbed layers shows that as the pressure increases from 1 to 3.5 MPa, the number of layers remains essentially constant at 1.5\u22121.6 for the high-rank Pocahontas coal, increases from 1.5 to 3 for the medium-rank Blind canyon coal, and increases from 2 to 3 for the low-rank Wyodak coal.

Coal matrix gas transport models, which assume a homogeneous unimodal pore structure and linear adsorption isotherms, are not appropriate for modeling methane or carbon dioxide adsorption rates in all coal lithotypes.  A new numerical model for matrix gas diffusion/adsorption is developed and applied to methane and carbon dioxide volumetric adsorption rate data.  The model accounts for nonlinear adsorption in microporosity, a bimodal pore vol. distribution, and time-varying gas pressure external to coal particles.  Methane and carbon dioxide adsorption rate behavior of bituminous coals with a multimodal pore vol. distribution, such as dull or banded coals, are accurately captured with the current numerical model and an anal. soln. which assumes a bimodal pore structure.  Single parameter (diffusivity) models may be adequate for some bright coals.  Careful consideration of coal pore structure is therefore required for accurate modeling of gas transport through the coal matrix.  Carbon dioxide numerical and anal. model diffusivities are larger than methane diffusivities obtained for dry coal.  In addn., methane diffusivities obtained using the models for wet coal are smaller than the model diffusivities obtained from dry coal.  The numerical model diffusivities, which are cor. for the effects of nonlinear adsorption, are larger than diffusivities obtained for anal. models for pore diffusion.  Methane and carbon dioxide gas anal. and numerical model effective diffusivities are sensitive to the starting pressure in an adsorption step.  The pressure-dependence of the anal. soln. diffusivities is likely due to the nonlinearity of the adsorption isotherm.  The effect of gas pressure upon diffusivities, obtained from the numerical model, indicate that the mechanism of gaseous diffusion is bulk diffusion.

Natural coal is viewed as a porous elastic copolymer in which both absorption and adsorption phenomena can occur.  The dominant role of submicropores which are about the size of a water mol. is stressed, as the effects of larger pores on sorption capacity are negligible.  Bearing in mind the size of the submicropores, one must take account of swelling of the sorbent and the resultant changes in its surface area.  A unified theor. description of sorption equil. with respect to swelling phenomena (multiple sorption model) is developed.  Alternative models describing effects of geometrical and chem. factors on the sorption energy are discussed.  The resultant theor. sorption isotherms are compared with empirical data for sorption of water and benzene in two coals.  The model explains differences in sorption properties of the coals in terms of the peculiarities of their surfaces.  Expansion was of crucial importance for the sorption of benzene.

Imbibing into the coal structure results in the swelling of macerals, the extent of which is strongly rank-dependent.  Uptake of CO2 on macerals is large.  It is due primarily to pore filling (coverage of micropores) and not to penetration within the coal structure.  Coverage of micropores by water is only a fraction of that of CO2.  Only a fraction of the surface of coal macerals is composed of hydrophilic sites.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaL1MXktFOisw%253D%253D&md5=769bc5f0054518f1e574c3a942cea5f3", " ", " "], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f1.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2003/langd5.2003.19.issue-23/la0258648/production/images/small/la0258648f00011.gif\">"]}
