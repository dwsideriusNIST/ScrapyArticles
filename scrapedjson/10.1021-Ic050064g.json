[FeII16][BF4]2 undergoes two reversible spin-crossover transitions at 91 and 192 K, and is the 1st two-step spin transition to undergo a simultaneous crystallog. phase transition, but does not exhibit thermal hysteresis.  The single-crystal structure detns. at 260 [space group P\u203e3, a 17.4387(4), c 7.6847(2) \u00c5] and at 130 K [space group P\u203e1, a 17.0901(2), b 16.7481(2), c 7.5413(1) \u00c5, \u03b1 90.5309(6), \u03b2 91.5231(6), \u03b3 117.8195(8)\u00b0] reveal two different Fe sites, Fe1 and Fe2, in a 1:2 ratio.  The room-temp. magnetic moment of 5.0 \u03bcB is consistent with high-spin Fe(II).  A plateau in \u03bc(T) having a moment of 3.3 \u03bcB centered at 130 K suggests a mixed spin system of some high-spin and some low-spin Fe(II) mols.  From the Fe-N bond distances at the two temps., and the molar fraction of high-spin mols. at the transition plateau, Fe1 and Fe2 can be assigned to the 91 and 192 K transitions, resp.  [FeII16][ClO4]2 [space group P\u203e3, a 17.5829(3), c 7.8043(2) \u00c5, \u03b2 109.820(3)\u00b0, T = 295 K] also possesses Fe1:Fe2 in a 1:2 ratio, and magnetic measurements show a single spin transition at 213 K, indicating that both Fe1 and Fe2 undergo a simultaneous spin transition.

The isosceles Fe3 unit contains two Fe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Fe distances of 3.2844(1) \u00c5 and a 3rd Fe\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Fe distance of 3.2857(1) \u00c5.
