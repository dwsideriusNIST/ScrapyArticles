However, the predominant method of producing hydrogen from natural gas or other fossil fuel sources requires abundant energy and results in the emission of a significant amount of CO", "2", " into the atmosphere [", "1", "]. Biomass, a type of renewable energy, is an abundant and environmentally friendly resource [", "2", "]. Combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis are the three typically thermochemical ways to convert biomass into electricity, syngas, and liquid fuels, respectively [", "3", ", ", "4", ", ", "5", ", ", "6", ", ", "7", ", ", "8", ", ", "9", ", ", "10", "].

Recently, we cooperated with researchers in the University of Massachusetts and proposed a new way for biomass conversion to liquid fuels and chemicals [", "12", ", ", "13", "]. We used aqueous phase of pyrolysis oils from biomass as feedstocks, first converted them to alcohols via selective hydrogenation and then to olefins and aromatics by zeolite conversion. Hydrogen is needed in the selective hydrogenation process, and so we proposed use of oil fraction of pyrolysis oil to produce hydrogen by chemical looping reforming (Fig.\u00a0", "1", "). This proposal can realize hydrogen production and CO", "2", " reduction together. Removal of CO", "2", " from the flue exhaust is one of the distinguishing features of this technology. Up to now, CO", "2", " is commonly removed by chilling and pressurizing or by aqueous amine absorption, both of them being costly and inefficient [", "14", "].

Nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves showed none hysteresis loop and basically reached their adsorption equilibrium in the low relative pressure, suggesting that they belonged to the first classification isotherm of the International Centre for Theoretical and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The quick adsorption equilibrium phenomenon was caused by the micropore filling, and so it can be inferred that the synthesized CuBTC crystal possessed ordered micropore structure. The BET surface area was 985\u00a0m", "2", "\u00a0g", "\u22121", ". The surface area was much larger than that of other adsorption materials, such as solid zeolite and silica gel, but was less than the CuBTC material synthesized by researchers [", "21", "]. This may be ascribed to the differences in the synthesis procedure and the organic solvent molecules in the CuBTC crystalline during the activation process, resulting in decreased specific surface area. Figure\u00a0", "4", "a shows the pore size distribution chart of CuBTC samples obtained by the DFT method. From the figure, it can be seen that a sharp peak occurs at the 0.8\u00a0nm, indicating the pore size and the pore structure of the synthesized CuBTC samples were highly ordered, and the most probable pore sizes were 0.8\u00a0nm.

The second severe mass loss in 300\u2013350\u00a0\u00b0C was attributed to decomposition, showing its appropriate temperature range usage. Since temperature of flue gas at coal-fired power plant is about 90\u00a0\u00b0C, this CuBTC crystals are fully applicable in the temperature range of flue gas from coal-fired power plant. According to the DTG curve of the as-synthesized crystals, two strong mass loss peaks and a weak mass loss peak can be seen in the figure. The first mass loss peak at 100\u00a0\u00b0C was the same as that of thermal gravimetric analysis, representing the removal of physically adsorbed water and solvent molecules in the crystals.

Since the adsorption is an exothermic process when adsorption temperature reached 25\u00a0\u00b0C, it would hinder the adsorption of gas molecules, leading to the initial low adsorption capacity with increasing temperature. However, the increase of relative pressure promoted the diffusion effect of gas molecules, and finally, in an atmospheric pressure, its adsorption capacity was the same as that at 0\u00a0\u00b0C. Besides, it can be seen that the adsorption amount of CuBTC still showed an upward trend in the atmospheric pressure, which inferred a nonequilibrium phenomenon, indicating an excellent carbon dioxide adsorption capacity under high pressure.
