One of the advantages of MOMs compared to other microporous materials, such as activated carbons, is their ability to exhibit a variety of pore surface properties such as hydrophilicity and chirality, as a result of the controlled incorporation of org. functional groups into the pore walls.  This capability means that the pore surfaces of MOMs could be designed to adsorb specific mols.; but few design strategies for the adsorption of small mols. have been established so far.  Here we report high levels of selective sorption of acetylene mols. as compared to a very similar mol., carbon dioxide, onto the functionalized surface of a MOM.

In the search for better low pressure CO2 sorbent materials, amine functionalization of porous solids was a common strategy.  However, to obtain efficient CO2 capture both the adsorption sites and the pore structure must be optimal.  The present study expands the use of combined expt. and simulation methods to understanding subtleties in CO2 binding in aminated solids.  It emphasizes that higher degrees of amination are not necessarily favorable as excessive clustering of amine groups can, in fact, interfere with CO2 binding.  It also further affirms that cooperative interactions between CO2 mols. contribute significantly to binding energies and it is postulated that sorbents with pores that bind higher aggregates of CO2 will significantly enhance heats of adsorption.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhs12gsb%252FI&md5=ef46b3f9ff994089ad5fe6a75b8ffab7", "(g) ", "Mukherjee", ", ", "P.", "; ", "Drew", ", ", "M.

The adsorption characteristics of nitrogen, Ar, CO2, nitrous oxide and EtOH and MeOH vapors on Ni2(4,4'-bipyridine)3(NO3)4 were studied over a range of temps. as a function of pressure.  Isotherm steps were obsd. for both CO2 and nitrous oxide adsorption at \u223c10-20% of the total pore vol. and at \u223c70% of total pore vol. for MeOH adsorption.  The adsorption kinetics obey a linear driving force (LDF) mass transfer model for adsorption at low surface coverage.  At high surface coverage, both MeOH and EtOH adsorption follow a combined barrier resistance/diffusion model.  The rates of adsorption in the region of both the CO2 and MeOH isotherm steps were significantly slower than those obsd. either before or after the step.  X-ray diffraction studies at various MeOH loadings showed that the host structure disordered initially but underwent a structural change in the region of the isotherm step.  These isotherm steps are ascribed to discrete structural changes in the host adsorbent that are induced by adsorption on different sites.  Isotherm steps were not obsd. for EtOH adsorption, which followed a Langmuir isotherm.  Previous x-ray crystallog. studies showed that all the sites are equiv. for EtOH adsorption on Ni2(4,4'-bipyridine)3(NO3)4, with the host structure undergoing a scissoring motion and the space group remaining unchanged during adsorption.  The activation energies and preexponential factors for MeOH and EtOH adsorption were calcd. for each pressure increment at which the linear driving force model was obeyed.  There was a good correlation between activation energy and ln(preexponential factor), indicating a compensation effect.
