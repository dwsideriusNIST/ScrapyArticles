The formation of cubic shaped nanoparticles was not observed in the absence of polymeric capping agents, clearly indicating the obligation for the use of polymers as capping agents. An extensive investigation of the reaction conditions indicated that the morphology of the nNiCo significantly depends on the reactions conditions, such as the concentration of the reactants and polymeric capping agents and the reaction time (", "Figure S2", ", SI). The formation of smaller sized irregular shaped nanoparticles in the presence of high m.wt. polydadmac is attributed to the complete capping of nanocrystals with a polymer that ultimately decreases the kinetics of crystal growth, restricting the particle conglutination. Similarly, we further investigated the influence of various polymeric solutions, such as 0.1% chitosan (CS), 2% polyethylenimine (PEI), and 1% and 2% low m.wt. polydadmac aqueous solution, on the shape selectivity of nNiCo (", "Figure ", "2", "). It is very interesting to note that the polymeric capping agents significantly influence the shape selectivity.", "(24, 25)", " The use of CS and PEI as capping agents resulted in the formation of irregular and aggregated particles (", "Figure S3", ", SI).", "Figure 3.

Due to the excellent shape selectivity along with moderate high surface area of nNiCo, we investigated the adsorption and desorption of nNiCo with methanol and water (commonly used as working fluids in geothermal applications).", "(13, 30)", " Vapor sorption experiments on nNiCo and bNiCo were performed at room temperature by activating them at 180 \u00b0C under reduced pressure (", "Figure ", "3", "a). Bulk NiCo powders suitable for methanol sorption were generated by placing the bNiCo crystals in mortar and ground by pestle with hand. The average size of bNiCo crystal used for methanol sorption is around 40\u2013150 \u03bcm. The adsorption isotherm of nNiCo exhibits a significantly accelerated guest uptake at lower pressure compared to bulk material, with an increased adsorption capacity of nNiCo by 4X at the same low pressure. The calculated MeOH wt % at room temperature in nNiCo indicates a very large uptake of methanol (\u223c22 wt % (6.8 mmol g", "\u20131", ") at low pressure (1\u20135 mbar). To investigate the role of polydadmac, methanol (MeOH) sorption experiments on low m.wt. polydadmac without nNiCo were performed at room temperature (", "Figure S7A-B", ", SI). The methanol adsorption isotherm and time-dependent methanol uptake of polydadmac (", "Figure S7A-B", ", SI) clearly illustrates that at lower pressure (up to 15 mbar) the uptake of methanol is very low, which is quite low compared to that observed in the case of nNiCo. These results demonstrate that the interaction between polydadmac and MeOH is not as strong as it with NiCo nanoparticle. These results emphasize the unique adsorption property of nNiCo synthesized using polydadmac. Further adsorption isotherm studies on materials synthesized using other polymers (CS and PEI) could reveal us information about the polymer-PCP interaction and effect of surface roughness of NiCo. However, when other polymers such as CS and PEI are used, it resulted in the formation of irregular aggregates of nNiCo particles were observed compared to well dispersed, shape controlled particles when polydadmac polymer is used (", "Figure ", "1", ", ", "Figure S3", ", SI). Adsorption isotherms and time-dependent methanol uptake studies on these aggregated nanomaterials do not evidently reveal the polymer-PCP interaction.", "Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were performed to confirm the adsorption capacities obtained experimentally. The simulation snapshots suggest at low pressure, methanol molecules preferentially occupy Ni and Co sites (", "Figure S8", ", SI) with an equilibrium adsorption capacity lower than experimentally observed (", "Figure S8", ", SI). In order to gain some insight on adsorption kinetics, approximately 18 mg (mass after activation) of nNiCo and bNiCo was placed in an adsorption chamber and introduced to 6 mbar of methanol vapor at room temperature. The mass increase due to the adsorption of methanol as a function of time was plotted, which clearly shows the time it takes for MeOH to reach equilibrium in nNiCo was <10 min compare to bNiCo (>60 min) at identical conditions (", "Figure ", "3", "b). The slower diffusion of methanol molecules in bNiCo explains the failure to predict and model correctly the equilibrium adsorption capacities by GCMC simulation, as such simulations are generally in a picosecond time scale.", "Figure 4. Methanol adsorption on four crystallographic planes of NiCo. The H and O atoms are displayed as white and red color, respectively.", "The relative enhancement in methanol adsorption kinetics in nNiCo particles as compared with the bulk material is likely due to the significantly shorter path length for diffusion in the nanomaterial.

Hence, a shorter penetration depth leads to a shorter equilibrium time. This change in kinetics is unlikely to alter the capillary condensation (equilibrium) pressure, which is set primarily by the pore radius and surface tension via the Kelvin equation.", "(31)", " Conversely, no clear distinction between the sorption kinetics of nNiCo and bNiCo was observed for water within the resolution of these adsorption experiments (", "Figure S9\u2013S10", ", SI). This is reasonable, as the kinetic diameter of water and methanol is 0.26 nm and 0.38\u20130.41, respectively.", "(32)", " A smaller diameter and the potential of polar effects translate to a faster diffusion coefficient for water over methanol, and possibly results in reduced distinction in adsorption kinetics between bNiCo and nNiCo.", "(32)", "Interestingly, the equilibrium time for nNiCo is approximately the same for the water as for the methanol (\u223c5 min). The seeming contradiction with the expected Fickian behavior for nNiCo (i.e., the water adsorption should equilibrate faster) may lie in the fact that for such nanoparticles, direct adsorption from the vapor, rather than a combination of adsorption and diffusion, may be the dominating mechanism for liquid condensation. These interesting but mystifying results advocate that at nanoscale, the contribution from the crystal plane becomes prominent along with shorter diffusion lengths for accelerated adsorption kinetics. Our observations on faster adsorption kinetics at nanoscale are in line with others reports reported in the literature, however, with limited discussion on factors contributing to faster adsorption in nanoscale MOFs.", "(33-35)", "In order to address the faster adsorption kinetics, the interaction of methanol molecules on various crystal planes of nNiCo was performed using first-principles density functional theory (DFT).

Colloidal metal-org. frameworks (CMOFs), nanoporous colloidal-sized crystals that are uniform in both size and polyhedral shape, are crystals composed of metal ions and org. bridging ligands, which can be used as building blocks for self-assembly in org. and aq. liqs.  They stand in contrast to conventional metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), which scientists normally study as bulk cryst. powders.  However, powder MOFs generally have random crystal size and shape and therefore do not possess either a definite mutual arrangement with adjacent particles or uniformity.  CMOFs do have this quality, which can be important in vital uptake and release kinetics.  In this Account, the authors present the diverse methods of synthesis, pore chem. control, surface modification, and assembly techniques of CMOFs.  The authors survey recent achievements and future applications in this emerging field.  There is potential for a paradigm shift, away from using just bulk cryst. powders, towards using particles whose size and shape are regulated.  The concept of colloidal MOFs takes into account that nanoporous MOFs, conventionally prepd. as bulk cryst. powders with random crystal size, shape, and orientation, may also form colloidal-sized objects with uniform size and morphol.  Also, the traditional MOF functions that depend on porosity present addnl. control over those MOF functions that depend on pore interactions.  They also can enable controlled spatial arrangements between neighboring particles.  To begin, progress regarding synthesis of MOF nano- and microcrystals whose crystal size and shape are well regulated are discussed.  Next, the authors review the methods to modify the surfaces with dye mols. and polymers.  Dyes are useful when seeking to observe nonluminescent CMOFs in situ by optical microscopy, while polymers are useful to tune their interparticle interactions.  Third, criteria to assess the stability of CMOFs for various applications are discussed.  In another section of this Account, the authors give examples of supracrystal assembly in liq., on substrates, at interfaces, and under external elec. fields.
