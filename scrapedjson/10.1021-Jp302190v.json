Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from large point sources such as power plants is one option for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions; however, currently the capture alone will increase the energy requirements of a plant by 25-40%.  This review highlights the challenges for capture technologies which have the greatest likelihood of reducing CO2 emissions to the atm., namely postcombustion (predominantly CO2/N2 sepn.), precombustion (CO2/H2) capture, and natural gas sweetening (CO2/CH4).  The key factor which underlies significant advancements lies in improved materials that perform the sepns.  In this regard, the most recent developments and emerging concepts in CO2 sepns. by solvent absorption, chem. and phys. adsorption, and membranes, amongst others, will be discussed, with particular attention on progress in the burgeoning field of metal-org. frameworks.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhtVaqu7fL&md5=96d81f8aa4797c4de5bd02965fa9fa5f", "6.

The recent progress in adsorption-based CO2 capture by MOFs is reviewed and summarized in this crit. review.  CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approx. atm. pressures.  Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore vols. of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, resp.  Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4.  Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites.  In addn., strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chem. bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement.  Besides the advantages, two main challenges of using MOFs in CO2 capture, the cost of synthesis and the stability toward water vapor, have been analyzed and possible solns. and path forward have been proposed to address the two challenges as well (150 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XivFWlsbo%253D&md5=0ff1149f94a6e21a49a6591786eac483", "7.

As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy was described by damped interat. potentials of the form C6R-6.  The use of pure, gradient-cor. d. functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resoln.-of-the-identity (RI) approxn. for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems.  In contrast to the previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality were employed, which reduced the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend.  By using a global scaling factor for the at. C6 coeffs., the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced.  The \"double counting\" of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes was found to be insignificant if steep damping functions were employed.  The method was applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small mols. (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene\u00b7H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC).  In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theor. or exptl. results for binding energies and intermol. distances is obtained.  For stacked arom. systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to std. MP2 treatments that systematically over-bind.  The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chem.

It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6\u00b7R-6.  A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common d. functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported.  The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on std. thermochem. benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked arom. mols. and group II element clusters, and for the computation of mol. geometries.  Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for std. functionals.  In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean abs. deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1.  The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the av. CCSD(T) accuracy.  The basic strategy in the development to restrict the d. functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interat. distances by damped C6\u00b7R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions.  As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference.

This work was stimulated by the reported failures of supermol. DFT calcns. to adequately predict intermol. (and interat.) interactions, particularly of the van der Waals type.  The goals are to develop a hybrid scheme that will calc. intermol. interaction energies accurately and in a computationally efficient fashion, while including the benefits of the energy decompn. provided by SAPT.  The computational savings result from replacing the costly perturbation theory treatment with DFT, which should include the intramol. correlation effects on the intermol. interaction energies.  The accuracy of this new hybrid approach (labeled SAPT(DFT)) is evaluated by comparisons with higher level calcns.  The test cases include He2, Ar2, Ar-H2, (H2O)2, (HF)2, CO2-CH3CN, and CO2-dimethylnitramine.  The new approach shows mixed results concerning the accuracy of interaction energies.  SAPT(DFT) correctly predicts all the qual. trends in binding energies for all test cases.  This is particularly encouraging in dimer systems dominated by dispersive interactions where supermol. DFT fails to predict binding.  In addn., the method achieves a drastic redn. (a factor of at least 100) in computational time over the higher level calcns. often used to predict these forces.  With respect to quant. accuracy, this initial hybrid scheme, using the very popular exchange-correlation functional B3LYP, overestimates the second-order energy components (e.g., induction and dispersion terms) for all of the test cases, and subsequently overestimates the total interaction energy for all dimer systems except those heavily dominated by the electrostatic interactions.  The SAPT energy decompn. points to the use of DFT virtual orbital eigenvalues in the second-order perturbation terms as the likely cause for this error.  These results are consistent with earlier work suggesting that DFT canonical virtual orbital energies obtained from commonly used functionals are less than optimal for use in such a perturbative scheme.  The first-order interaction energy terms from the SAPT(DFT) are found to be generally more accurate than the second-order terms, and agree well with the benchmark values for dimers contg. mols. with a permanent elec. dipole moment.  These first-order terms depend only upon the occupied MO eigenvectors, and hence are not affected by the inaccuracies in the Kohn-Sham DFT virtual orbital eigenvalues.

In this contribution we present a DFT-AIMD study of liq. water using several GGA functionals as well as the van der Waals d. functional (vdW-DF) of Dion et al.

When a vdW-DF is used, the d. improves drastically and the exptl. diffusivity is reproduced without the need of thermal corrections.  We analyze the origin of the d. differences between all the functionals.  We show that the vdW-DF increases the population of non-H-bonded interstitial sites, at distances between the first and second coordination shells.  However, it excessively weakens the H-bond network, collapsing the second coordination shell.  This structural problem is partially assocd. to the choice of GGA exchange in the vdW-DF.
