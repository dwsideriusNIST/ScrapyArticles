In this force field, only nonbonded parameters are used to describe Zn-O interactions.  The CVFF force field was used with slight modifications to describe the benzene dicarboxylate linker.  The force field correctly predicts a wide range of structural properties of this MOF, including a neg. thermal expansion of approx. 1% at 30 and 293 K, in agreement with both theory and expt.  Compressibility results and the assocd. elastic moduli are in also good agreement with published d. functional theory calcns. and nanoindentation expts.  The force field predicts a decrease in elastic moduli as temp. increases, which would greatly affect the mech. properties of MOFs.  Calcd. vibrational frequencies for Zn-O modes agree with expt., and a low-frequency mode representing a 180\u00b0 rotation of the Ph groups is seen.  This rotation becomes more prevalent as the temp. is increased from 300 to 400 K, in agreement with NMR data.  Simulations were also carried out with adsorbed guests, including ethanol, cyclohexane, and several chloromethanes.  It is shown that the IRMOF-1 lattice parameter depends on the nature of the guest-framework interaction; strongly hydrophilic guests, such as ethanol, cause a decrease (-0.9%) in unit cell vol., while hydrophobic guests cause an increase (0.7-1.5%) in unit cell vol.  The calcd. free vols. in IRMOF-1 range from 53.5% to 56.0%, in good agreement with expt.  Finally, the activation energy for benzene self-diffusion calcd. at low loadings is in good agreement with previous simulations and NMR results, but the magnitude of the diffusion const. is underestimated, most likely because of deficiencies in the CVFF portion of the force field.

The MOF materials were developed to provide a large reversible hydrogen-storage capacity leading to as much as 73% free vol.  However, the NTE properties suggest other possible applications.  Thus, their porous but constrained three-dimensional framework provides a framework onto which other materials might blend to form composites with negligible vol. change with temp.

In many applications, it is essential to understand their mech. properties.  The authors report the measurement of the elastic modulus of IRMOF-1 crystals using two different nanoindentation techniques.  The reduced modulus from continuous stiffness measurements, calcd. from the av. single-crystal Young's modulus (E) of 2.7 \u00b1 1.0 GPa, is in good agreement with the value obtained from conventional quasistatic measurements.  Permanent deformation without fracture was obsd. directly after indentation.  For comparison, the authors performed d. functional theory (DFT) calcns. of the elastic properties using both the local d. approxn. (LDA) and the generalized gradient approxn. (GGA).  The resulting, well-converged DFT value (LDA-GGA av.) for E is 21.6 \u00b1 0.3 GPa, with C11 = 0.28 \u00b1 0.01 GPa, C12 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.01 GPa, and C44 = 0.03 \u00b1 0.02 GPa.  Correcting the measured modulus for the highly anisotropic elastic behavior predicted by DFT suggests an effective modulus for the (100) face of 7.9 GPa.  The DFT prediction is expected to be reliable here.  Therefore, the lower measured Young's modulus is most likely due to an interesting behavior during fractureless plastic deformation that occurs in these framework materials.  Deformation or buckling in this nanoporous structure likely leads to structural changes at the lowest loads the authors can apply in the expt.  This appears to be a unique property of MOFs, where the elastic properties of the plastically deformed materials behave differently than those for more traditional nanoporous metals, ceramics, and polymers.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXhsVant77J&md5=71193221b124f3d4666a7c1f4c7a674c", " ", "29.

Because of the strong affinity with the framework, CO2 is preferentially adsorbed over CH4 in all MOFs.  Framework catenation leads to constricted pores and addnl. adsorption sites and enhances the interaction with the adsorbate.  Therefore, catenated IRMOF-13 and PCN-6 exhibit a greater extent of adsorption, particularly for CO2, at low pressures than IRMOF-14 and PCN-6'; however, the opposite is true at high pressures. CO2/CH4 selectivity in IRMOF-1 and IRMOF-14 is almost const. at low pressures and increases with increasing pressure.  As a result of a counterbalance between energetic and entropic effects, the selectivity in IRMOF-13 initially decreases at low pressures and then increases with pressure and finally approaches a const. value.  Catenated MOFs have a higher selectivity than their noncatenated counterparts.  The presence of electrostatic interaction between CO2 and the framework increases CO2 adsorption and a corresponding decrease in CH4 adsorption and consequently enhanced selectivity.  In charged soc-MOF, the extra framework NO3- ions are identified to be equally distributed from the nearest metal atoms and vibrate around the favorable sites.  The selectivity in soc-MOF is substantially higher than in the other IRMOFs and PCNs and is the highest among various MOFs reported to date.

Both expts. and simulations show strong inflection characteristics in the adsorption isotherms.  The primary cause of the inflection is due to the strong preference for adsorption within, and in the regions close to the mouths of tetrahedral pockets.  The isotherm inflection has a significant influence on the dependence of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity, D, on the fractional occupancy, Di.  Both IRM expts. and simulations show that the Di-\u03b8i behavior appears to be influenced by the loading dependence of the inverse thermodn. factor 1/\u0393i = dln\u03b8i/dlnpi.  For nC4 and iC4, the Di increase sharply by about one order of magnitude as the occupancy \u03b8i increases from 0 to about 0.2.  This increase is caused by the fact that the diffusion characteristics undergo a transition from being dominated by hops across narrow 4.6 \u00c5 windows at low loadings to hops across large 9 \u00c5 windows for loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell.  For loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell the Di-\u03b8i dependence of nC4 and iC4 is dictated by 1/\u0393i, characteristic of more open channel structures such as FAU zeolite.

The simulations identify the octahedral cages (sites II and III) and the big cages (site I') as the preferred positions for adsorption, while site I, near the copper atoms, remains empty over the entire range of pressures analyzed due to its reduced accessibility.  The occupation of the different sites for ethane and propane in Cu-BTC proceeds similarly as for methane, and shows small differences for O2 and N2 that can be attributed to the quadrupole moment of these mols.

Hohenberg-Kohn and Kohn-Sham theorems were proven for a Hamiltonian that is not quite exact for real atoms, mols., and solids.  (2) The d. functional for the exchange-correlation energy, which must be approximated, arises from the tendency of electrons to avoid one another as they move through the electron d.  (3) In the absence of a magnetic field, either spin densities or total electron d. can be used, although the former choice is better for approxns.  (4) \"Spin contamination\" of the determinant of Kohn-Sham orbitals for an open-shell system is not wrong but right.  (5) Only to the extent that symmetries of the interacting wave function are reflected in the spin densities should those symmetries be respected by the Kohn-Sham noninteracting or determinantal wave function.  Functionals below the highest level of approxns. should however sometimes break even those symmetries, for good phys. reasons.  (6) Simple and commonly used semilocal (lower-level) approxns. for the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the d. can be accurate for closed systems near equil. and yet fail for open systems of fluctuating electron no.  (7) The exact Kohn-Sham noninteracting state need not be a single determinant, but common approxns. can fail when it is not.  (8) Over an open system of fluctuating electron no., connected to another such system by stretched bonds, semilocal approxns. make the exchange-correlation energy and hole-d. sum rule too neg.  (9) The gap in the exact Kohn-Sham band structure of a crystal underestimates the real fundamental gap but may approx. the first exciton energy in the large-gap limit.  (10) D. functional theory is not really a mean-field theory, although it looks like one.  The exact functional includes strong correlation, and semilocal approxns. often overestimate the strength of static correlation through their semilocal exchange contributions.

There have been more than 1500 publications since the mid-1990s, on combined QM-MM methodologies.  Limitations in current models include the distortional characteristics of force field potential terms, the smooth transit from one potential surface to another, rather than surface hopping, and the blending of electrostatics between QM and MM portions of a QM-MM model.  Functional forms, potential surface coupling terms, and parameterization strategies for the Approx. Pair Theory (APT), a next generation reactive force field model, are described.  The APT model has been developed to correct a no. of limitations in current reactive force field models as well as providing a foundation for a next generation QM-MM model.  Chem. bonding concepts are used to develop fully dissociative bond stretch, bend, torsion, and inversion valence terms.  Quantum mechanics also provides functional forms for potential surface coupling terms that permit a general description of reactivity from hydrogen bonding, through non-classical carbocations and cracking, to olefin polymn., oxidn., and metathesis.  Van der Waals, electrostatic, and metallic bonding models also derive from quantum mech. resonance.
