However, synthesis of MOFs with desired functionality is very challenging because many chem. functionalities cannot be achieved under the conditions for MOF assembly.  Herein, a facile synthesis of new functionalized two-dimensional MOFs with preferential CO2 capture is presented, which uses two successive synthesis steps: 1) rational design and template-free synthesis of the parent MOF with designated pendant amino groups and 2) postsynthetic modification of the active amino groups with acetic acid and trimesoyl chloride functionalities.  The only variation in structure arises from the functional groups of these materials.  Exptl. results demonstrate that the three 2D layered MOFs have remarkable thermal stability and moisture resistance, which are particularly advantageous for practical CO2 capture.  Although their surface areas are moderate (270-340 m2 g-1), they still have excellent CO2 adsorption capacity (up to 2.9 mmol g-1 at 1 bar and 273 K) comparable to that of previously reported MOFs with much higher surface areas.  Based on first-principles calcns., it is shown that the acidic carbonyl functionalities in addn. to the amino groups are also favorable to bind CO2 mols.

The resultant materials were alk.-cation-exchanged, widely characterized and finally tested as H adsorbents.

N and H adsorption isotherms at 77 K suggested that alkali-exchanged materials have lower affinity for H than the as-prepd. samples compensated by imidazolium ion; however, due to the smaller size of Na+ or Li+ cations, their lower affinity is easily compensated by the inherent increase in surface area and pore vol. as exchange degree increases.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhtVyrur3O&md5=daf8b20cf6ead852e8d5cd58a03f4362", "(c) ", "Nugent", ", ", "P.", "; ", "Belmabkhout", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Burd", ", ", "S.
