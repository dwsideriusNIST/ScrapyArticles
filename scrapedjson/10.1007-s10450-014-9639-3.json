Its presence in increasing concentrations in the atmosphere has been contributing to increase the greenhouse effect and may be leading to uncertain climate changes (Cavenati et al. ", "2006a", "). According to the IEA (", "2013", ") CO", "2", " emissions have grown almost 50\u00a0% between 1990 and 2011 in a global scale. The concentration of CO", "2", " has reached 394 ppmv in 2012, resulting in an average growth of 2\u00a0ppmv/year in the last 10\u00a0years. The most important sources of carbon dioxide emissions are power plants that generate electricity from fossil fuels (e.g. coal, oil, and natural gas), accounting for one-third of the global CO", "2", " emissions to the atmosphere (Shafeeyan et al. ", "2014", "; Mulgundmath et al. ", "2012", "). Therefore, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have been gaining attention as potential solutions for reducing point source emissions (Mulgundmath et al. ", "2012", "). It is estimated that CCS processes will contribute to 15\u201355\u00a0% of the cumulative mitigation effort worldwide until 2100 as reported in IPCC (", "2005", ").", "A typical power station flue gas composition contains 8\u201313\u00a0mol% CO", "2", ", 3\u20136\u00a0mol% O", "2", ", 10\u201316\u00a0mol% H", "2", "O and 71\u201376\u00a0mol%\u00a0N", "2", " (Kargari and Ravanchi ", "2012", "). Therefore, the most representative binary system for pre-dried flue gases is the CO", "2", "\u2013N", "2", " mixture (Belmabkhout and Sayari ", "2009", ").", "Apart from capture and storage issues, one may also find useful applications for CO", "2", " (e.g. enhanced oil recovery, beverage carbonation, metal manufacture, etc.), but the gas must be relatively pure (>95\u00a0%) (Franchi et al. ", "2005", ").", "Carbon dioxide separation and purification have been carried out by means of several technologies, including absorption, cryogenic distillation, membrane separation, and adsorption (Jing et al. ", "2014", "; Bae et al. ", "2008", "; Plaza et al. ", "2009", "). Amine based absorption or scrubbing processes have been used for the separation of CO", "2", " from natural gas and flue gas streams for many years, but despite its large commercial use, this type of process has several drawbacks, including high energy costs during solvent regeneration, low carbon dioxide loading capacity, high equipment corrosion and amine degradation by SO", "2", ", NO", "2", ", HCl, HF and O", "2", " present in the flue gas (Finsy et al. ", "2009", "; Yang et al. ", "2008", "; Ho et al. ", "2008", ").", "It has been reported that the costs associated with CO", "2", " capture by adsorption processes can be lower than the costs of conventional CO", "2", " absorption using liquid solvents (Ho et al. ", "2008", "; Radosz et al. ", "2008", "). Adsorption based methods using microporous materials are potentially cost-efficient, particularly in separation processes such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), which are commonly accepted to be the most attractive, efficient and affordable due to its simple control, low operating and capital investment costs as well as higher energy efficiency (Bae et al. ", "2008", "; Finsy et al. ", "2009", "; Zhang et al. ", "2008", "). Recent studies have shown suitable results by combining both processes in a vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) for CO", "2", " capture from flue gas (Liu et al. ", "2011", "; Shen et al. ", "2012", "; Wang et al. ", "2012", "; Liu et al. ", "2012", ").", "The choice of a suitable adsorbent is one of the important issues for the design of an adsorption process (Mulgundmath et al. ", "2012", "). As a consequence, a wide variety of adsorbents, including activated carbon (AC), metal organic-frameworks (MOF) and zeolites, have been investigated in recent years for this purpose (Dantas et al. ", "2010", "; Bastin et al. ", "2008", "; Won et al. ", "2012", "). These adsorbents must possess a superior selectivity for CO", "2", " over the other components, a high working capacity and easy regenerability (Shafeeyan et al. ", "2014", "; Mulgundmath et al. ", "2012", "). Although zeolites are the most widely used adsorbents for CO", "2", " removal, presenting considerably higher capacities than that of activated carbons when the CO", "2", " partial pressure is less than 0.2\u00a0MPa, their use is usually associated to high power consumption due to the steepness of CO", "2", " isotherms and, therefore the need of vacuum during the desorption step (Cavenati et al. ", "2006b", "; Mulgundmath et al. ", "2012", "). Furthermore, the presence of water in the mixture hinders CO", "2", " adsorption capacity in zeolites (Plaza et al. ", "2009", ").", "Activated carbons are considered very attractive materials for applications in CO", "2", " separation from binary CO", "2", "\u2013N", "2", " mixtures due to their high surface area, micropore volume and suitable pore size distribution. The high availability of carbon sources makes their industrial scale production relatively cost-efficient (Sircar et al. ", "1996", "). Additionally, activated carbons do not require any moisture removal and usually present a low heat of adsorption, which results in lower energy requirements for regeneration (Yang ", "1997", "). On the other hand, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) can provide some key advantages as selective adsorbents: high porosity, rapid diffusion kinetics, tunable binding strengths affecting selectivity, and high surface areas that can result in a large working capacity (Krishna and Long ", "2011", "; Asadi et al. ", "2013", ").", "The knowledge of the adsorption equilibrium is very important for the evaluation of the adsorption uptake of adsorbents and therefore it is critical for the design and optimization of industrial PSA units. A more accurate understanding of the process performance may be achieved by performing experiments in a fixed bed with multicomponent mixtures (Grande et al. ", "2013", "), coupled with comparisons with simulation results using a mathematical model to predict the dynamic behavior of CO", "2", " separation.", "This work provides adsorption equilibrium data of pure CO", "2", " and N", "2", " on two activated carbons and one MOF at 298, 323 and 348\u00a0K and pressures up to 1.0\u00a0MPa, as well as breakthrough curves of CO", "2", "\u2013N", "2", " mixtures on the same samples at 298 and 348\u00a0K and total pressure of ", "ca", ". 0.1\u00a0MPa at the outlet of the fixed bed. A model using the linear driving force (LDF) approximation and considering the energy and momentum balances was applied. The model was validated by comparing simulations with experimental data.

", "1999", "). Textural properties were obtained by measuring adsorption/desorption isotherms of nitrogen at 77\u00a0K using an Autosorb-1 MP (Quantachrome, USA). From these, specific surface areas were determined according to the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller\u00a0(BET) method and both micropore volumes and average pore width were estimated using the Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich (DR) equation (Rouquerol et al.

These temperatures represent typical capture conditions. The samples were pre-treated in situ at 423\u00a0K under vacuum (1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010", "\u22128", "\u00a0MPa) until no mass variation in the system was observed. Experiments with helium (non-adsorbed gas) were carried out in order to determine the specific volume of the solid phase, which allows for accounting buoyancy effects on measurements with adsorbing gases.
