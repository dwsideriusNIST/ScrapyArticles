Herein we report the construction of two highly stable MOFs (1 and 2) using elongated dicarboxylate bridging ligands derived from Cp*Ir(L)Cl complexes (L = dibenzoate-substituted 2,2'-bipyridine, bpy-dc, or dibenzoate-substituted 2-phenylpyridine, ppy-dc) and Zr6O4(OH)4(carboxylate)12 cuboctahedral secondary building units (SBUs) and the elucidation of water oxidn. pathways of the Cp*Ir(L)Cl catalysts using these MOFs.

The (bpy-dc)Ir(H2O)2XCl (X is likely a formate or acetate group) complex resulted from the oxidative degrdn. process was identified as a competent catalyst responsible for the water oxidn. activity of 1.

Kinetics of MOF-catalyzed WORs were monitored by Ce4+ consumptions and fitted with a reaction-diffusion model, revealing an intricate relationship between reaction and diffusion rates.

The authors describe the prepn. and characterization of two Zn MOFs based on a flexible and emissive linker mol., stilbene, which retains its luminescence within these solid materials.  Reaction of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid (H2L) and zinc nitrate in DMF yielded a dense 2-dimensional network, Zn3L3(DMF)2 (1), featuring Zn in both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination environments connected by trans-stilbene links.  Similar reaction in N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) at higher temps., followed by replacement of solvent in workup, resulted in a porous, 3-dimensional framework structure, Zn4OL3\u00b7(DMF)(CHCl3) (2).  This framework consists of two interpenetrating cubic lattices, each featuring basic Zn carboxylate vertexes joined by trans-stilbene, analogous to the isoreticular MOF (IRMOF) series.  The optical properties of both 1 and 2 correlate with the local ligand environments obsd. in the crystal structures.  Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements reveal that the stilbene linkers in the dense structure 1 exhibit a small degree of interchromophore coupling.  In contrast, the stilbenoid units in 2 display very little interaction in this low-d. 3-dimensional framework, with excitation and emission spectra characteristic of monomeric stilbenes, similar to the dicarboxylic acid in dil. soln.  In both cases, the rigidity of the stilbene linker increases upon coordination to the inorg. units through inhibition of torsion about the central ethylene bond, resulting in luminescent crystals with increased emission lifetimes compared to solns. of trans-stilbene.  The emission spectrum of 2 depends on the nature of the incorporated solvent mols., suggesting use of this or related materials in sensor applications.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXltlWlurs%253D&md5=d4fb4e7121ad3251fba2c481c1ca2c49", "17.
