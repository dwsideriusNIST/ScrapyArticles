Some of the most promising MOFs show enhanced selectivity for the olefins due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, but accurate predictive models for such systems are still lacking. In this paper, we present results of a combined experimental and theoretical study on adsorption of propane, propylene, ethane, and ethylene in CuBTC, a MOF with open metal sites. We first propose a simple procedure to correct for impurities present in real materials, which in most cases makes experimental data from different sources consistent with each other and with molecular simulation results. By applying a novel molecular modeling approach based on a combination of quantum mechanical density functional theory and classical grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to achieve excellent predictions of olefin adsorption, in much better agreement with experiment than traditional, mostly empirical, molecular models. Such an improvement in predictive ability relies on a correct representation of the attractive energy of the unsaturated metal for the carbon\u2013carbon double bond present in alkenes.

The key structural characteristic of CuBTC is a copper paddlewheel with a Cu\u2013Cu distance of 2.63 \u00c5 for the hydrated material. Each copper atom is coordinated to another Cu atom, four oxygen atoms from the btc linkers, and one water (solvent) molecule.

Thus, the dehydrated form of CuBTC was considered in all adsorption simulations in this paper without any change in the cell parameters and in the remaining atomic positions.

Through DFT calculations on ethylene\u2013CuBTC clusters with different adsorbate orientations, we found the most favorable configuration to be that in which the C\u2550C vector is perpendicular to the Cu\u2014Cu vector, with the center of the double bond precisely above the closest Cu atom.", "(32)", " The best way to include this interaction in our model is, therefore, to add an extra interaction site at the center of the C\u2550C bond of the olefins (see the green spheres in Figure ", "2", "d and e). This site interacts only with the Cu atoms through an empirical function that is fitted to the DFT interaction energy profiles. The remainder of the model, that is, the LJ interactions between each adsorbate site and all the other adsorbate and adsorbent sites in the system (including the metal), is retained from the standard DREIDING force field. In other words, we are assuming that all the repulsion and dispersion interactions in the system are already accurately described through the standard force field; thus, we are simply adding the specific interactions that are not accounted for in this model, that is the Cu\u2212\u03c0 interactions. This approach is advantageous mainly for three reasons:", "(19)", " (i) it allows us to simplify the problem, focusing only on the specific interactions caused by the CUS, without the need for a full reparameterization of all the fluid\u2013solid potential parameters, (ii) it increases the chances that the model will be transferable to other MOFs, as the CUS\u2013adsorbate interactions are decoupled from the other dispersion-based interactions, and (iii) it means that our model will benefit directly from independent force field developments, even in MOFs that do not contain CUS.", "In order to obtain a realistic representation of the Cu\u2013olefin interactions, we first need to decompose the DFT energy profile, extracting only the component that is due to this specific interaction. We first assume, as we did in our previous paper,", "(32)", " that both induction and permanent electrostatic interactions are negligible in this system.

It is clear from ", "Supporting Information", " Figures S1 and S2 that the effect of accounting explicitly for electrostatic interactions in these systems is negligible, validating our assumption. It is worth noting that this conclusion is likely not to be valid for other adsorbates (e.g., acetylene or CO", "2", "(30)", "). However, our approach can be easily adapted to include electrostatic interactions, and this is the subject of ongoing work by our team.", "The second assumption is that our DFT calculations with the PBE functional and DNP basis set do not take into account any dispersion interactions, that is, the dispersion component of the DFT energy is assumed to be zero. This is justified by the well-known inability of conventional DFT exchange-correlation functionals to accurately quantify dispersion interactions.", "(52-57)", " Although this may be considered a rather drastic approximation, we believe it represents a suitable compromise for our purposes. Indeed, the use of a higher-level quantum mechanical approach (e.g., coupled-cluster or MP2, which do a much better job than DFT at describing dispersion interactions) for such a large system would make the computational cost prohibitive. An alternative approach would be to apply an empirical dispersion correction to the DFT energies (the so-called DFT+D approach), then to subtract the dispersion contribution already included in the classical LJ potential. This is also not satisfactory, partly because it would involve adding and subtracting two distinct empirical contributions, thus accumulating uncertainty in the final value of the energy, and partly because DFT+D methods have not yet been shown to be sufficiently accurate to describe adsorption in MOFs.", "(58, 59)", "With the above assumptions, the specific Cu\u2212\u03c0 interaction energy profile can be computed from", "(2)", "where ", "U", "DFT", " is the total distance-dependent DFT energy between ethylene and the CuBTC cluster, ", "U", "Cu\u2212\u03c0", " is the contribution to the energy due to the specific interaction between the Cu atom and the olefin double bond, ", "U", "rep", " is the repulsion contribution, and ", "r", " is the distance between the center of the double bond and the closest Cu atom of the MOF.

This analysis strongly suggests that for this particular sample (and perhaps also for the sample used by Chowdhury et al.", "(67)", "), discrepancies between experiment and simulation cannot be resolved by simply scaling for the pore volume of an imperfect MOF sample relative to a perfect crystal. Indeed, Chowdhury et al.", "(67)", " compared adsorption isotherms on two different CuBTC samples and observed that they could not be made to agree by applying a constant scaling factor for the entire pressure range.", "Another possible explanation for the differences observed in Figure ", "6", " is the use of an incorrect procedure for the experimental measurements, including insufficient time allowed for equilibration or incomplete activation. The latter, however, seems unlikely as most of the measurements we report (including our own) involved activation at 423 K under vacuum. So if this activation were inadequate for some measurements (Wehring et al. and Chowdhury et al.) it would also be for the others (Rube\u0161 et al., Yoon et al., Wang et al. and our own data). Instead, we observe that the latter isotherms are consistent with each other, whereas the former two are not.

This is admittedly a rather simplified view because defects may change the pore structure in a nontrivial way, perhaps even introducing new low energy sites for adsorption (hence, changing the isotherm curvature at low pressure). Nevertheless, the agreement observed here for different adsorbates and at least four different MOF samples suggests that it may at least provide a good approximation to compare experiments to simulations or to compare experimental data obtained on different samples, provided they are of good quality.

The initial decrease reflects the structural and energetic heterogeneity of CuBTC\u2014the adsorbates initially occupy the most favorable adsorption sites, the S1 cages and windows for both adsorbates and the CUS in case of propylene, and only then move on to the less favorable regions, which causes the heat of adsorption to decrease in the low coverage regime.

Molecular simulation provides a very powerful approach for this purpose, but several issues still need to be resolved. One of these issues is the need for accurate experimental reference data to compare with simulation predictions. Indeed, while simulations are almost always performed in ideal MOF crystals, real samples may suffer from impurities or defects. In this paper, we have proposed a simple approach to account for this fact based on a rescaling of the experimental isotherms by the ratio of the theoretical pore volume of an ideal crystal to the experimental pore volume of the real sample. By applying this approach, experimental data obtained on at least four different samples and spanning a wide range of temperatures and pressures can be made consistent with each other. Moreover, our molecular simulations of ethane, ethylene, propane, and propylene show excellent agreement with the rescaled experimental isotherms.", "The rescaling approach assumes that the only effect of impurities and defects is a reduction of the accessible pore volume for adsorption, but this assumption may not always be valid. Defects, for example, can also introduce new adsorption sites that would not be present in an ideal MOF crystal. This might help explain why we have not obtained good agreement with rescaled experimental data on two of the samples we examined. However, other possible explanations, such as insufficient equilibration of the experimental measurements, cannot be ruled out at this point. Inadequacies in our molecular model are another possible source of error, although it is unlikely that realistic model adjustments would be able to account for the differences in saturation capacity observed in Figures ", "6", " and ", "12", ". It is clear that additional studies are needed to assess the actual effects of impurities, defects, and occluded solvent molecules on adsorption in MOFs.

The slight overestimation of ethylene adsorption (Figure ", "9", ") and underestimation of the adsorbed amount for propylene (Figures ", "10", " and ", "11", ") is possibly caused by some of the assumptions of our model. In particular, our assumption that the DFT/PBE calculations do not include any dispersion interactions is almost certainly not exact and is, hence, a possible source of error.

(steam cracking and Fluid Catalytic Cracking) were studied.  The effects of the different step times in the performance of the PSA unit were evaluated.  PSA performance was also studied using different operating conditions:process temp. and feed pressure.  Also, the removal of inert from the process was studied.  The simulation of the PSA unit was performed in gPROMS using a bi-LDF approxn. for mass transfer.  Exptl. purities of propylene around 99.0% were obtained.  The recovery of propylene in some of the runs reached values higher than 85% which is much higher than 30% obtained in previous studies.  The best performance was obtained at 408 K where simulated purity was 99.43% with a recovery of 84.3% and a unit productivity of 2.57 mol/h.kg of zeolite.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXhtFSksrjJ&md5=5251a6b24281399dbeebf1bacf06d57e", "4.

Previous modeling studies have shown that these interactions are not adequately modeled when literature force-field parameters are used.  Typical results of grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations exhibit a pronounced underestimation of the hydrogen uptake at low pressures and low temps.  In this study, it is shown that this shortcoming can be resolved by deriving a new set of potential parameters to represent the metal-dihydrogen interaction from ab initio calcns. for mol. model systems.  The approach is computationally efficient and could be applied for any coordination environment of the metal center.  The present work focuses on three MOFs with unsatd. copper centers.  The newly derived Cu-H2 potential model is combined with literature force-field parameters to model the dispersive interactions with other framework atoms.  At cryogenic temps. and pressures up to 1 bar, GCMC simulations using these parameters provide for a massively improved prediction of the hydrogen storage characteristics when compared to parameters from a literature force field.  On the other hand, the unmodified literature parameters perform best in predicting the satn. uptake.  At room temp., the effect of the potential modification is much smaller, and the best agreement with expt. is obtained when the localized metal-dihydrogen interaction is not accounted for in the simulations.  This indicates that the metal-dihydrogen interaction is too weak to permit a significant adsorption at the metal sites under these conditions.  Calcns. using an artificially enhanced potential model show that a drastic increase of the interaction strength could boost the hydrogen storage capacity at room temp., although the attainable uptake remains limited by the no. of available metal sites.

In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its abs. values, as it is currently done with mol.

For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional mol. ESP approaches generate 'unphys.' charges, whereas the REPEAT method produces charges that are both chem. intuitive and consistent between different periodic electronic structure packages.  The new approach is employed to generate partial at. charges of various microporous materials and compared to both exptl. derived and mol. fragment ESP charges.

Given the ubiquitous nature of dispersion in chem. and biol. systems, this is not a trivial matter.  Recent advances in the development of DFT methods can treat dispersion.  These include dispersion-cor. DFT (using explicit, attractive dispersion terms), parameterized functionals, and dispersion-correcting potentials, all of which can dramatically improve performance for dispersion-bound species.  In this perspective, we highlight the achievements made in modeling dispersion using DFT.

It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6\u00b7R-6.  A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common d. functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported.  The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on std. thermochem. benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked arom. mols. and group II element clusters, and for the computation of mol. geometries.  Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for std. functionals.  In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean abs. deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1.  The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the av. CCSD(T) accuracy.  The basic strategy in the development to restrict the d. functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interat. distances by damped C6\u00b7R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions.  As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference.  From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chem. method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XhtFenu7bO&md5=0b4aa16bebc3a0a2ec175d4b161ab0e4", "55.

For all gases, the ratio of specific adsorption capacities of the two samples can be broadly classified into two regions.  In the low loading region this ratio was about 2.03 with in a 10% uncertainty envelope.  However, in the high loading region, it increases to about 2.58.  Thus, the scaling factor needed to compare adsorption isotherms of Cu-BTC having different surface areas may not be unique.

These tendencies are consistent with corresponding measurements of heats of adsorption and with data obtained in mol. dynamics (MD) simulations.
