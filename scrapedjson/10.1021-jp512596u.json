Advances in flexible and functional metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), also called soft porous crystals, are reviewed by covering the literature of the five years period 2009-2013 with ref. to the early pertinent work since the late 1990s.  Flexible MOFs combine the cryst. order of the underlying coordination network with cooperative structural transformability.  These materials can respond to phys. and chem. stimuli of various kinds in a tunable fashion by mol. design, which does not exist for other known solid-state materials.  Among the fascinating properties are so-called breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host-guest interactions.  Phase transitions are triggered by guest adsorption/desorption, photochem., thermal, and mech. stimuli.  Other important flexible properties of MOFs, such as linker rotation and sub-net sliding, which are not necessarily accompanied by crystallog. phase transitions, are briefly mentioned as well.  Emphasis is given on reviewing the recent progress in application of in situ characterization techniques and the results of theor. approaches to characterize and understand the breathing mechanisms and phase transitions.  The flexible MOF systems, which are discussed, are categorized by the type of metal-nodes involved and how their coordination chem. with the linker mols. controls the framework dynamics.  Aspects of tailoring the flexible and responsive properties by the mixed component solid-soln. concept are included, and as well examples of possible applications of flexible metal-org. frameworks for sepn., catalysis, sensing, and biomedicine.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXht1Slu7nI&md5=b824d2bff6379c9662b50e86739b42f7", "6.

The structure of the aluminum analog AlOH(H2L)\u00b7nH2O (n \u223c 3, L = O3P-CH2-NC4H8N-CH2-PO3) was solved from a small single crystal and refined against lab. powder X-ray diffraction data.  The structure of the titanium form (TiO(H2L)\u00b7nH2O (n \u223c 4.5)) was detd. using the structure of the aluminum form as a starting model and refining it against lab. X-ray data.  Their structures are built up from trans corner-sharing chains of TiO6 or AlO6 octahedra linked together in two directions via the diphosphonate groups.  In each case this gives rise to a three-dimensional hybrid network with small channels along the b axis filled with free water mols.  Thermogravimetric anal. and X-ray thermodiffractometry of the samples reveal that water is lost reversibly below 423 K and that both structures are stable up to 463 K.  Dehydration gives porous solids (pore size \u223c 3.5 \u00d7 4.0 \u00c52) which adsorb nitrogen at 77 K to give Langmuir surface areas close to 500 m2\u00b7g-1.

The fully dehydrated solid possesses permanent porosity with elliptical channels 8 \u00c5 \u00d7 9 \u00c5 in free diam.  The structural change results from the loss of H2O coordinated to the Ni cations, so that the Ni coordination changes from edge-sharing octahedral NiO5N to edge- and corner-sharing 5-fold NiO4N.  During this change, two out of three phosphonate groups rotate to become fully coordinated to Ni cations, leaving the remainder of the phosphonate groups coordinated to Ni cations by two O atoms and with a P=O bond projecting into the channels.  This transformation, which is completely reversible, causes substantial changes in both vibrational and electronic properties as shown by IR, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopies.  Complementary adsorption, calorimetric, and IR studies of the probe adsorbates H2, CO, and CO2 reveal several distinct adsorption sites in the solid, which are attributed to their interactions with Ni cations which are weak Lewis acid sites, as well as with P=O groups that project into the pores.

The heat of adsorption is an important thermodn. quantity that can be measured both in expts. and mol. simulations, and therefore it is often used to study the quality of a force field for a certain guest-host (g-h) system.  In mol. simulations, the heat of adsorption in zeolites is often computed using either of the following methods: (1) using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which requires the partial deriv. of the pressure with respect to temp. at const. loading, (2) using the energy difference between the host with and without a single guest mol. present, and (3) from energy/particle fluctuations in the grand-canonical ensemble.  To calc. the heat of adsorption from expts. (besides direct calorimetry), only the 1st method is usually applicable.  Although the computation of the heat of adsorption is straightforward for all-SiO2 zeolites, severe difficulties arise when applying the conventional methods to systems with nonframework cations present.  The reason for this is that these nonframework cations have very strong Coulombic interactions with the zeolite.  The authors will present an alternative method based on biased interactions of guest mols. that suffers less from these difficulties.  This method requires only a single simulation of the host structure.  The authors will review some of the other important issues concerning the handling of these strong Coulombic interactions in simulating the adsorption of guest mols.

The compd. was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction, TGA, IR and BET method.  This compd. is isostructural to the MIL-53 type, previously obsd. with the trivalent cations Cr, Fe, Al, In.  It exhibits a three-dimensional metal-org. framework built up from infinite chains of trans corner-sharing GaO4(OH)2 octahedra (via \u03bc2-hydroxo bonds) linked to each other through the terephthalate linkers.  It gave lozenge-shaped channel structure running parallel to the infinite files of Ga-centered octahedra.  After activation, the compd. is able to adsorb one molar equivalent of H2O at room temp. under ambient air (MIL-53(Ga){H2O}).  Different H bond interactions are obsd. for the encapsulated H2O within the channels.  In one tunnel, pairs of H2O species with strong H-bond interactions were obsd. whereas in the adjacent tunnel, only a continuous linear and weakly H bonded network occurs.  The dehydrated form was obtained upon heating the MIL-53(Ga) solid at 80\u00b0 together with the shrinkage of the channels in MIL-53(Ga)_lt.

The BET surface area was 1140 \u00b1 114 m2 g-1.  The phase transitions were characterized by IR spectroscopy at different temps., which confirms the stability domain of the narrow close form (specific band at 1016 cm-1) of MIL-53(Ga) and then the pore opening (shifted band toward 1024 cm-1) together with the structure collapse.

In the case of the adsorption of CO2 on faujasite Y, however, the inverse order is found at low pressure: CsY and KY adsorb stronger than NaY and LiY.  This trend cannot be explained by a simple monopole-dipole or monopole-quadrupole interaction of CO2 with a single cation.  Therefore, the authors have conducted a combined adsorption, IR and DFT study to shed light on this phenomenon.  A simultaneous interaction of CO2 with the cations (located in the hexagonal window between supercage and sodalite cage) and framework oxygen atoms (in the 12-ring connecting two supercages) can explain the strong adsorption of CO2 on CsY and KY.  The authors also discuss the effect of van der Waals interactions.  Although there is a redistribution of the charge of three framework oxygen atoms in the 12-ring towards the carbon atom of CO2, the geometry of CO2 remains almost linear.  The adsorption mode can, therefore, be interpreted as a carbonate precursor.  In zeolite Y, this acid-base like interaction is more important than polarization of CO2 by the cation only.  Also, evidence for an adsorption mode where CO2 binds simultaneously to two cations in the supercage was detected by DFT, as already reported for Na-ferrierite.  This adsorption mode is, however, strongly dependant on the distance between two cations in the supercage and is only favorable in the case of KY.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXht1yktbbE&md5=a413e5312267686e22a1fb009c8c61de", "54.
