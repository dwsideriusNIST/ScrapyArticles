The importance of photosynthesis has driven researchers to seek ways to mimic its fundamental features in simplified systems.  The absorption of a photon by light-harvesting (antenna) complexes made up of a large no. of protein-embedded pigments initiates photosynthesis.  Subsequently the many pigments within the antenna system shuttle that photon via an efficient excitation energy transfer (EET) until it encounters a reaction center.  Since the 1995 discovery of the circularly arranged chromophoric assemblies in the crystal structure of light-harvesting antenna complex LH2 of purple bacteria Rps.  Acidophila, many designs of light-harvesting antenna systems have focused on cyclic porphyrin wheels that allow for efficient EET.  In this Account, the authors review recent research in their labs. in the synthesis of covalently and noncovalently linked discrete cyclic porphyrin arrays as models of the photosynthetic light-harvesting antenna complexes.  On the basis of the silver(I)-promoted oxidative coupling strategy, the authors have prepd. a series of extremely long yet discrete meso-meso-linked porphyrin arrays and covalently linked large porphyrin rings.  The authors examd. the photophys. properties of these mols. using steady-state absorption, fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime, fluorescence anisotropy decay, and transient absorption measurements.  Both the pump-power dependence on the femtosecond transient absorption and the transient absorption anisotropy decay profiles are directly related to the EET processes within the porphyrin rings.  Within these structures, the exciton-exciton annihilation time and the polarization anisotropy rise time are well-described in terms of the Forster-type incoherent energy hopping model.  In noncoordinating solvents such as CHCl3, meso-pyridine-appended zinc(II) porphyrins and their meso-meso-linked dimers spontaneously assemble to form tetrameric porphyrin squares and porphyrin boxes, resp.  In the latter case, the authors have demonstrated the rigorous homochiral self-sorting process and efficient EET along these cyclic porphyrin arrays.  The meso-cinchomeronimide appended zinc(II) porphyrin forms a cyclic trimer.  The authors have also shown that the corresponding meso-meso-linked diporphyrins undergo high-fidelity self-sorting assembling to form discrete cyclic trimer, tetramer, and pentamer with large assocn. consts. through perfect discrimination of enantiomeric and conformational differences of the meso-cinchomeronimide substituents.  Collectively, these studies of covalently and noncovalently linked discrete cyclic porphyrin arrays aid in the understanding of the structural requirements for such very fast EET in natural light-harvesting complexes.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXht12iu7bI&md5=857073a8d0fb201c3e086bf7d9f17130", "6.

These transitions greatly increase the ability of these dimers to absorb the solar spectrum over a broad wavelength range.  Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals the relative rate of rotation of the macrocycles around the butadiyne bond joining them.

There is much diversity in the way in which photosynthetic organisms harvest sunlight.  In chromophore-protein complexes, an exact orientation of pigments by the protein matrix ensures an efficient stepwise energy transfer to the reaction center where charge sepn. occurs.  The charge sepn. and subsequent electron transfer steps are, however, very similar in all organisms, proving that there must exist a common ancestor.  The architectural principle of chromophore-protein complexes is too complicated to be replicated in artificial light-harvesting devices.  A simpler principle employs self-assembling chromophores that early green photosynthetic bacteria use in their chlorosomal antenna systems.  Efforts in mimicking this self-assembly algorithm with fully synthetic pigments are presented.

Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.

Researchers have developed artificial metalloporphyrins, but these structures have had limited catalytic applications.  Homogeneous artificial metalloporphyrins can undergo catalytic deactivation via suicidal self-oxidn., which lowers their catalytic activity and sustainability relative to their counterparts in Nature.  Heme mols. in protein scaffolds can maintain high efficiency over numerous catalytic cycles.  Therefore, we wondered if immobilizing metalloporphyrin moieties within porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) could stabilize these structures and facilitate the mol. recognition of substrates and produce highly efficient biomimetic catalysis.  In this Account, we describe our research to develop multifunctional porphyrinic frameworks as highly efficient heterogeneous biomimetic catalysts.  Our studies indicate that porous porphyrinic frameworks provide an excellent platform for mimicking the activity of biocatalysts and developing new heterogeneous catalysts that effect new chem. transformations under mild conditions.  The porous structures and framework topologies of the porphyrinic frameworks depend on the configurations, coordination donors, and porphyrin metal ions of the metalloporphyrin moieties.  To improve the activity of porous porphyrinic frameworks, we have developed a two-step synthesis that introduces the functional polyoxometalates (POMs) into POM-porphyrin hybrid materials.  To tune the pore structures and the catalytic properties of porphyrinic frameworks, we have designed metalloporphyrin M-H8OCPP ligands with four m-benzenedicarboxylate moieties, and introduced the secondary auxiliary ligands.  The porphyrin metal ions and the secondary functional moieties that are incorporated into porous metal-org. frameworks greatly influence the catalytic properties and activities of porphyrinic frameworks in different reactions, such as the oxidn. of alkylbenzenes, olefins, and hexane and the photo-oxygenation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene and sulfides.  The porphyrin metal ions and the secondary auxiliary sites in the pores can work together synergistically to enhance the catalytic activities of porphyrinic frameworks.  Compared with their homogeneous counterparts, the activities and stabilities of the heterogeneous porphyrinic frameworks are remarkable: the immobilization of metalloporphyrins onto the pore surfaces of MOFs not only prevents their suicidal self-oxidn. but also allows them to activate inert substrate mols., such as cyclohexane.  Moreover, because the bulky mols. cannot easily access the active sites inside the pores of porphyrinic frameworks, these porous materials demonstrate interesting size-selective catalytic properties toward substrates.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXitVyiurw%253D&md5=d5c1e6b8f584d401939078d57d7f3a62", "17.

The synthetic versatility and the potential application of metalloporphyrins (MP) in different fields have aroused researchers' interest in studying these complexes, in an attempt to mimic biol. systems such as cytochrome P 450.  Over the last 40 years, synthetic MPs have been mainly used as catalysts for homogeneous or heterogeneous chem. reactions.  To employ them in heterogeneous catalysis, chemists have prepd. new MP-based solids by immobilizing MP onto rigid inorg. supports, a strategy that affords hybrid inorg.-org. materials.  More recently, materials obtained by supramol. assembly processes and contg. MPs as building blocks have been applied in a variety of areas, like gas storage, photonic devices, sepn., mol. sensing, magnets, and heterogeneous catalysis, among others.  These coordination polymers, known as metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), contain org. ligands or complexes connected by metal ions or clusters, which give rise to a 1-, 2- or 3-D network.  These kinds of materials presents large surface areas, Bronsted or redox sites, and high porosity, all of which are desirable features in catalysts with potential use in heterogeneous phases.  Building MOFs based on MP is a good way to obtain solid catalysts that offer the advantages of bioinspired systems and zeolitic materials.  In this minireview, the authors uses a historical approach to present the most relevant MP-based MOFs applicable to catalytic reactions such as oxidn., redn., insertion of functional groups, and exchange of org. functions.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtFWisbrE&md5=f5f39177457eca06183c73e92733eb36", "19.

The current great interest in prepg. functional metal-org. materials is inevitably assocd. with tremendous research efforts dedicated to the design and synthesis of new families of sophisticated multi-nucleating ligands.  In this context, the N-donor triazole and tetrazole rings represent two categories of ligands that are increasingly used, most likely as the result of the recent dramatic development of \"click chem.\" and Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs).  Thus, azole-based complexes found numerous applications in coordination chem.  In the present review, the authors focus on the use of 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole ligands to create coordination polymers, metal complexes and spin-crossover compds., reported to the end of 2009.  In the first instance, the authors present a compendium of all the relevant ligands that were employed to generate coordination polymers and Metal-Org. Frameworks (MOFs).  Due to the huge amt. of reported MOFs and coordination polymers bearing these azole rings, three representative examples for each category (therefore nine in total) are described.  The second section is devoted to the use of the bridging abilities of these azole ligands to prep. metal complexes (contg. at least two metal centers).  Given the large no. and the great structural diversity of the polynuclear compds. found in the literature, these were grouped according to their nuclearity.
