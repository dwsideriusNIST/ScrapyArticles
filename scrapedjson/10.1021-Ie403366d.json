Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.

It was found that the adsorptive capacity decreases with the temp. for the carbon prepd. from the unoxidized coal, while it increases for the carbons from the oxidized coal.  This difference can be attributed to different populations of oxygen functional groups on the carbon surfaces.  According to the Langmuir model, the adsorption of phenol on these carbons was found to be to an endothermic process.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1cXltVegurs%253D&md5=1ba929ec4558e101067b6004e94b24d4", "37.
