X-ray crystallog. characterization reveals that adjacent layers are stacked such that channels are created, except in 5.  The channels form a H-bonded interior for guest mols.; in practice, 1a contains EtOH and H2O mols. as guests in the channels with H bonds, whereas 3b (3a) contains THF (acetone) mols.  In 1a, the double-edged axe-shaped motifs in adjacent sheets are not located over the top of each other, while the motifs in 3b stack so perfectly as to overlap each other in an edge-to-edge fashion.  This subtle change in the three-dimensional framework is assocd. with the template effect of the guests.  Compd. 5 has no guest mols. and, therefore, the amide groups in one sheet were used for H-bonding links with adjacent sheets.  Removal of the guest mols. from 1a and 3b (3a) causes a structural conversion accompanied by a color change.  Pink 1a cannot retain its original framework and changes into a blue amorphous compd.  However, the framework of pink 3b (3a) is transformed to a new cryst. framework of violet 4.  The complex 4 reverts to the original pink crystals of 3b (3a) when it is exposed to THF (or acetone) vapor.  Spectroscopic measurements (visible, EPR, and IR) provide a clue to the crystal-to-crystal transformation; on removal of the guests, the amide groups were used to form the \u03b2 sheet-type H bonding between the sheets, and thus the framework withstands significant stress on removal of guest mols.  This mechanism is attributed to the arrangement of the adjacent sheets so suited in regularity that the \u03b2 sheet-type structure forms efficiently.  The apohost 4 does not adsorb cyclopentane, showing a guest selectivity that, in addn. to size, H-bonding capability is required for the guest mols.  The obtained compd. is categorized as a member of a new generation of compds. tending towards functional porous coordination polymers.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD38Xmslequro%253D&md5=0c04df5898be666193514745e254dd16", "2.

The uptake and encapsulation of guest species by host frameworks are being investigated for a wide variety of purposes, including sepn. and storage using zeolites, and recognition and sensing by enzymes in soln.  Here we focus on the concept of the cooperative integration of 'softness' and 'regularity'.  Recent developments on porous coordination polymers (or metal-org. frameworks) have provided the inherent properties that combine these features.  Such soft porous crystals exhibit dynamic frameworks that are able to respond to external stimuli such as light, elec. fields or the presence of particular species, but they are also cryst. and can change their channels reversibly while retaining high regularity.
