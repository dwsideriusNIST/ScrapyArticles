Especially, the separation of the isotopes hydrogen and deuterium requires special efforts, even though these isotopes show a very large mass ratio. Conventionally, H/D separation can be realized through cryogenic distillation of the molecular species or the Girdler-sulfide process, which are among the most energy-intensive separation techniques in the chemical industry. However, costs can be significantly reduced by using highly mass-selective nanoporous sorbents. Here, we describe a hydrogen isotope separation strategy exploiting the strongly attractive open metal sites present in nanoporous metal\u2013organic frameworks of the CPO-27 family (also referred to as MOF-74).

Note that our calculations refer only to the individual selectivity of the open Co(II) sites. The remaining gas in the framework pores has a much weaker adsorption enthalpy, thus a smaller difference in ZPE and in the partition functions and consequently a much lower selectivity. Hence, our calculations are expected to somewhat overestimate the selectivity, in particular, for higher surface coverage when additionally weaker adsorption sites are occupied which are not considered in the theoretical calculation, and for a correct treatment, different approaches (", "e.g.", ", PI-GCMC", "(13)", " or QLDFT", "(27)", ") in conjunction with a force field well-parametrized for CPO-27-Co would be necessary.

In general, the quantum sieving effect is more evident at lower temperature as shown in ", "Figure ", "4", "b (COF-1), but an increase of molar ratio with temperature (CPO-27-Co) indicates that the material has a selectivity governed by the coverage of the adsorption sites, a quantity that is strongly related to pressure and temperature.

However, the foregoing results evidently demonstrate the feasibility of achieving effective \u201cequilibrium-based QS\u201d for industrial hydrogen isotope separation. Clearly, designing MOFs possessing numerous strong binding sites will substantially improve the overall isotope separation performance even at high temperature. As it is shown in ", "Figure ", "3", "b, the performance of these highly D", "2", "-selective metal sites can be rationalized by the fact that the difference in zero point energies (producing quantum effects) of isotopes is the main driving force for the separation of the hydrogen isotopes even at high temperature. Moreover, the direct observation of first experimental equilibrium-based QS, which is not influenced by kinetic effects during the separation process, in conjunction with a theoretical analysis highlights its great advantage in terms of technical and economical aspects.

This suggests that FH-GCMC, which uses the approximative Feynman-Hibbs treatment, is as useful as PI-GCMC for exploring H2 adsorption at 77 K. Moreover, we show that the ideal adsorption soln. theory (IAST) can predict the selectivity of D2 over H2 in the interstices of single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) bundles at 77 K (below 0.1 MPa) very well by comparing the obtained results with the mixt. adsorption FH-GCMC simulations.

Desolvation provides a bimodal porous structure Zn3(BDC)3[Cu(Pyen)] (M'MOF 1) with narrow porosity (<0.56 nm) and an array of pores in the bc crystallog. plane where the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions are maximized by both the presence of open Cu centers and overlap of the potential energy fields from pore walls.  The H2 and D2 adsorption isotherms for M'MOF 1 at 77.3 and 87.3 K were reversible with virtually no hysteresis.  Methods for detn. of the isosteric enthalpies of H2 and D2 adsorption were compared.  A virial model gave the best agreement (av. deviation <1 std. deviation) with the isotherm data.  This was used in conjunction with the van't Hoff isochore giving isosteric enthalpies at zero surface coverage of 12.29 \u00b1 0.53 and 12.44 \u00b1 0.50 kJ mol-1 for H2 and D2 adsorption, resp.  This is the highest value so far obsd. for H adsorption on a porous material.  The enthalpy of adsorption, decreases with increasing amt. adsorbed to 9.5 kJ mol-1 at .ltorsim.\u22481.9 mmol g-1 (2 H2 or D2 mols. per Cu corresponding to adsorption on both sides of planar Cu open centers) and is virtually unchanged in the range 1.9-3.6 mmol g-1.  Virial anal. of isotherms at 87.3 K is also consistent with 2 H2 or D2 mols. being bound to each open Cu center.  The adsorption kinetics follow a double exponential model, corresponding to diffusion along 2 types of pores, a slow component with high activation energy (13.35 \u00b1 0.59 kJ mol-1) for the narrow pores and a faster component with low activation energy (8.56 \u00b1 0.41 kJ mol-1).  The D2 adsorption kinetic consts. for both components were significantly faster than the corresponding H2 kinetics for specific pressure increments and had slightly lower activation energies than the corresponding values for H2 adsorption.  The kD2/kH2 ratio for the slow component was 1.62 \u00b1 0.07, while the fast component was 1.38 \u00b1 0.04 at 77.3 K, and the corresponding ratios were smaller at 87.3 K.  These observations of kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving in porous materials are due to the larger zero-point energy for the lighter H2, resulting in slower adsorption kinetics compared with the heavier D2.  A combination of open metal centers and confinement in ultramicroporosity leads to a high enthalpy for H2 adsorption over a wide range of surface coverage and quantum effects influence diffusion of H2 and D2 in pores in M'MOF 1.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXltVyjsLo%253D&md5=cd9993fbfa093dfecfd6324ec8f7d042", "10.

Extensive path integral Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the square-shaped C pores enhanced the selectivity of D over H in comparison to equiv. slit-shaped C pores at zero coverage as well as at finite pressures (i.e. quantum sieving of H isotopes is pore-topol.-dependent).  This enhancement of the D2/H2 equil. selectivity results from larger localization of H isotopes in square-shaped pores.

The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coeffs. and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles.  The coeffs. for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations.  System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination nos. (CN).  They are used to interpolate between dispersion coeffs. of atoms in different chem. environments.  The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each d. functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of at. forces.  Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered.  The method has been assessed on std. benchmark sets for inter- and intramol. noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems.  The mean abs. deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 std. d. functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version.  Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems.  The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coeffs. also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface.  For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding.  We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in mols. and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.
