However, their luminescence activities are not satisfying since most aromatic linkers do not contain large conjugated systems (i.e., fused aromatic rings) or metal-linker charge transfers are not significant (except for lanthanides-linkers), resulting in low detection sensitivity and thus limiting their sensing applications.", "Several efforts have been made to improve luminescence activities of MOFs by functionalizing MOFs, including the utilities of special linkers with high luminescence quantum yield,", "(9)", " and encapsulation luminescent guest molecules or nanoparticles.", "(10-12)", " The introduction of highly luminescent materials into MOFs while basically maintaining the original structures and properties of host MOFs has shown obvious improvements in both sensing selectivity and sensitivity. For example, encapsulation of highly fluorescent (FL, quantum yield >40%) carbon quantum dots in ZIF-8 has led to a significant increase (2 orders of magnitude improvement) in detection sensitivity for copper ions, compared with fluorescence sensor without MOFs.", "(12)", " However, there is still much room for improving the sensitivities of MOFs-based sensors. Up until now, most reported MOF sensors are based on luminescence quenching of lanthanide ions or aromatic fluorophores. The luminescence quenching (or signal off) transduction modes do not result in very low detection limits due to significant luminescence backgrounds. Additionally, the luminescence quenching events usually happen between one luminophore and one target, i.e., one point to one point interaction, thus it is difficult to amplify signal by raising the quantities of luminophores in MOFs. Therefore, design and synthesis luminescent MOFs that can be used for signal-on and signal-amplifying sensing of targets will be an important alternative for improving the sensitivities of MOF-based sensors.", "As well-known, MOFs are porous materials with very high specific surface areas, which enable them to contain large quantities of cargoes, such as drugs or luminophores. Apparently, the detection sensitivities of MOFs-based sensors would be greatly improved if large quantities of luminophores loaded in MOFs can be responsively released by small quantities of targets in an appropriate way. To reach this target-responsive release of luminophores from MOFs, the luminescence-functionalized MOFs should have following two properties: first, MOFs containing luminophores can maintain great stability in aqueous solutions in the absence of targets in order to get low optical background. Second, the release of large quantities of luminophores should be completed in a short time to obtain high sensitivity and fast response. Apparently, this is a challenging task in the design and synthesis of the desired MOFs since the good stability of luminescence-functionalized MOFs may conflict with easy release of guest luminophores from MOFs. Generally, if stable MOFs are used, it is difficult to release guest cargoes (luminophores or drugs) from the frameworks in short time. For example, MOFs have now been used for drug delivery and release, in which the drugs are slowly released over tens of hours, even several days.", "(7)", " Apparently, these types of MOFs with slow guest material release are unfit for sensing although they have shown promising applications in medicine.", "Recently, we have found a kind of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)-functionalized MOFs (RuMOFs) can serve as ideal signal-on and signal-amplifying sensing materials.

However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approx. atm. pressures.  Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore vols. of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, resp.  Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4.  Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites.  In addn., strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chem. bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement.

The as-synthesized FL-functionalized MOFs not only maintain an excellent FL activity and sensing selectivity derived from BPEI-CQDs but also can strongly and selectively accumulate target analytes due to the adsorption property of MOFs.  The selective accumulation effect of MOFs can greatly amplify the sensing signal and specificity of the nanosized FL probe.  The obtained BPEI-CQDs/ZIF-8 composites were used to develop an ultrasensitive and highly selective sensor for Cu2+ ion, with a wide response range (2-1000 nM) and a very low detection limit (80 pM), and were successfully applied in the detection of Cu2+ ions in environmental water samples.  It is envisioned that various MOFs incorporated with FL nanostructures with high FL quantum yields and excellent selectivity would be designed and synthesized in similar ways and could be applied in sensing target analytes.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhvFejtbnE&md5=acb33313ae92fef237971de8c996defd", "13.

The energy migration process is initiated by the photoexcitation of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition in one of the Ru(II) complexes and terminated by energy transfer to a lower energy Os(II) trap.  Energy transfer sensitization of Os(II) can occur in a single step if the excited state is formed adjacent to a trap, or after a series of hops between isoenergetic rutheniums prior to reaching a trap.  The dynamics of the energy transfer process are followed by monitoring the growth of Os(II)* luminescence at 780 nm.  The kinetics of the growth are complex and can be fit by a sum of two exponentials.  This kinetic complexity arises both from the presence of a distribution of donor-acceptor distances and the variety of time scales by which Os(II)* can be formed.  The authors augmented the time-resolved expts. with Monte Carlo simulations, which provide insight into the polymer array's structure and at the same time form the basis of a mol.-level description of the energy migration dynamics.  The simulations indicate that the most probable Ru* \u2192 Os energy transfer time is \u223c400 ps while the time scale for Ru* \u2192 Ru hopping is approx. 1-4 ns.  The time scale for Ru* \u2192 Ru hopping relative to its natural lifetime (1000 ns) suggests that this polymer system could be extended to considerably longer dimensions without an appreciable loss in its overall efficiency.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXntFKqs7g%253D&md5=f9958e31525d758aa297f74ac1963fa4", "17.

A significant body of literature, guided by seminal work on cation sensing, describes the prepn. of small mol. Hg(II) detectors, and the authors highlight these strategies.

In addn., the novelty of such an assay lies in its simplicity, inexpensiveness, and portability (without ligand synthesis, just using urine directly), which is very useful in remote and less industrialized areas.
