Diamond already finds use in many different applications including, of course, its use as a precious gem, but also as a heat sink, as an abrasive, and as inserts and/or wear-resistant coatings for cutting tools.  Obviously, it is possible to envisage many other potential applications for diamond as an engineering material, but progress in implementing many such ideas was hampered by the comparative scarcity of natural diamond.

So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.

Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.
