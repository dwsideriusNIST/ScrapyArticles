The generation of metal-org. framework (MOF) coordination polymers enables the tailoring of novel solids with regular porosity from the micro to nanopore scale.  Since the discovery of this new family of nanoporous materials and the concept of so called 'reticular design', nowadays several hundred different types of MOF are known.  The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centers, linked together with a variety of polyat. org. bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mech. stability.  Describing examples of different Zn-contg. structures, e.g. MOF-2, MOF-5 and IRMOF-8 verified synthesis methods will be given, as well as a totally novel electrochem. approach for transition metal based MOFs will be presented for the 1st time.  With sufficient amts. of sample now being available, the testing of metal-org. frameworks in fields of catalysis and gas processing is exemplified.  Report is given on the catalytic activation of alkynes (formation of methoxypropene from propyne, vinylester synthesis from acetylene).  Removal of impurities in natural gas (traces of tetrahydrothiophene in methane), pressure swing sepn. of rare gases (Kr and Xe) and storage of H (3.3% at 2.0 MPa/77 K on Cu-BTC-MOF) will underline the prospective future industrial use of metal-org. frameworks in gas processing.

Here the authors employ data mining and automated structure anal. to identify, cleanup, and rapidly predict the H storage properties of these compds.  Approx. 20,000 candidate compds. were generated from the CSD using an algorithm that removes solvent/guest mols.

The screening identifies several overlooked compds. having high theor. capacities; these compds. are suggested as targets of opportunity for addnl. exptl. characterization.

Here we explore the extent to which powder densification can overcome these deficiencies, as well as characterize the impact of densification on crystallinity, pore vol., surface area, and crush strength.  MOF-5 powder was processed into cylindrical tablets with densities up to 1.6 g/cm3 by mech. compaction.

Higher densities result in larger redns. in gravimetric excess.  Total pore vol. and surface area decrease commensurately with the gravimetric capacity, and are linked to an incipient amorphization transformation.  Nevertheless, a large fraction of MOF-5 crystallinity remains intact in densities up to 0.75 g/cm3, as confirmed from powder XRD.  Predictably, the radial crush strength of the pellets is enhanced by densification, increasing by a factor of 4.3 between a d. of 0.4 g/cm3 and 0.6 g/cm3.

The sensitivity of certain MOFs under humid conditions is well-known, but systematic studies of water adsorption properties of MOFs are lacking.  This information is crit. for developing design criteria for directing future synthesis efforts.  The goal of this work is to understand the influence of the extent of Zn-O bond shielding on the relative stabilities of MOFs belonging to the same family of isostructural, non-catenated pillared MOFs [Zn(L)(DABCO)0.5], where L is the functionalized BDC (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) linker.  The different extent of Zn-O bond shielding is provided by incorporating a broad range of functional groups on the BDC ligand.  The resulting MOFs have varying surface areas, pore sizes, and pore vols.  Stability is assessed through water vapor adsorption isotherms combined with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) expts. and surface area analyses.  Integration of polar functional groups (e.g., nitro, bromo, chloro, hydroxy, etc.) on the dicarboxylate linker renders these MOFs water unstable compared with the parent MOF as these polar functional groups have a neg. shielding effect; i.e., they facilitate hydrolysis of the Zn-O bond.  On the other hand, placing nonpolar groups (e.g., methyl) on the BDC ligand results in structurally robust MOFs because the Zn-O bond is effectively shielded from attack by water mols.  Therefore, the anthracene- and tetramethyl-BDC MOFs do not lose crystallinity or surface area after water exposure, in spite of the large amt. of water adsorption due to capillary condensation at \u223c20% relative humidity (RH).  This has been obsd. rarely in the MOF literature.  The results of this work show that by ligand functionalization it is possible to adjust the water stability of a pillared MOF in both the pos. and neg. directions and, thus, provide an important step toward understanding the water adsorption behavior of MOFs.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xhs1entr7J&md5=60a6277dba75e45e82bd5e631bb15dfa", "14.

However, the systematic water stability studies required to develop design criteria for the construction of water-stable MOFs are still scarce.  In this work, the authors show that by varying the functional groups on the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) linker of DMOF [Zn(BDC)(DABCO)0.5], they can systematically tune the kinetic water stability of this isostructural, pillared family of MOFs.  To illustrate this concept, water adsorption studies were performed on four novel, methyl-functionalized DMOF variations along with a no. of already reported functionalized analogs contg. polar (fluorine) and nonpolar (methyl) functional groups on the BDC ligand.  These results are distinctly different from previous reports where the apparent water stability is improved through the inclusion of functional groups such as -CH3, -C2H5, and -CF3 which only serve to prevent significant amts. of water from adsorbing into the pores.  In this study, the authors present the first demonstration of tuning the inherent kinetic stability of MOF structures in the presence of large amts. of adsorbed water.  Notably, while the parent DMOF structure is unstable, the DMOF variation contg. the tetra-Me BDC ligand remains fully stable after adsorbing large amts. of water vapor during cyclic water adsorption cycles.  These trends cannot be rationalized in terms of hydrophobicity alone; exptl. water isotherms show that MOFs contg. the same no. of Me groups per unit cell will have different kinetic stabilities and that the precise placements of the Me groups on the BDC ligand are therefore critically important in detg. their stability in the presence of water.  Water adsorption isotherms, PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) patterns, and BET surface areas before and after water exposure are presented to illustrate these trends.  Furthermore, the important distinction between kinetic and thermodn. stability in MOFs is discussed.

The addn. of 10% ENG to MOF-5 and compaction to 0.5 g/cm3 was previously found to increase the thermal cond. relative to neat MOF-5 of the same d. by a factor of 5.

At 35 bars and 77 K, the adsorption storage d. of hydrogen is half that of the liq. state (71 g L-1 at 20 K).  It is also 3.4 times the d. of compressed hydrogen gas under the same conditions.  Measurements of the hydrogen uptake of different adsorbents show that an ideal microporous carbon will have a storage d. of 58 g L-1.  The measurements also show that, for initial screening purposes, we can predict the hydrogen storage capacity of the adsorbents from their readily available phys. properties like surface area or micropore vol. and bulk d.
