Comparing the VPSA results for the two studied ACs, AC-S was found to be slightly better performing in terms of the CO", "2", " separation. It can be concluded that CO", "2", " of a high purity can be produced only at higher adsorption pressures in the used VPSA cycles. However, the compression of feed to a high pressure is very energy consuming, especially in large industrial installations. Therefore, the incorporation of another operation into the VPSA cycles that increases the CO", "2", " purity at a relatively low pressure has been investigated.", "3.5.2", "CO", "2", " Rinse", "The results of the VPSA/CO", "2", " process are illustrated in Figure ", "8", ". Similarly to VPSA, the VPSA/CO", "2", " process is strongly affected by adsorption pressure. An decrease of the adsorption pressure leads to a considerable enhancement of both the recovery and productivity of CO", "2", " (Figure ", "8", "a and c, respectively), while the variations in the product purity are insignificant (Figure ", "8", "b). The CO", "2", " recovery ranges from 32% to 75%, and the productivity is between 41 and 91 L/(L\u00b7h). However, the obtained recovery and productivity are lower than in the VPSA process, especially at higher pressures. This can be explained by the rinse operation for which CO", "2", " was utilized. However, the purity of CO", "2", " in the product stream is very high (about 95%) in the whole range of tested adsorption pressures for all adsorbents.", "Figure 8.

An increase in the CO", "2", " concentration in the final product compensates for the loss of the process efficiency (productivity). The level of rinse operation can be considered as a specific regulator of CO", "2", " concentration in the final product. This process provides an environmentally friendly fuel with a low CO", "2", " content. Taking into account the presence of water vapor in the feed stream, A-CS seems to be very promising for separation of CO", "2", " from coal gasification-derived gas.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results and Discussion", "Conclusions", "References", "4 Conclusions", "The VPSA process was found to be an effective method of CO", "2", " separation from a mixture of CO, CO", "2", ", H", "2", ", and CH", "4", " simulating the processing gases from coal gasification.

The obtained VPSA results indicate that, with an increasing adsorption pressure, the CO", "2", " recovery and productivity decreases, while the product purity increases. The performance of the zeolite 13X was better than that of the B and A-CS carbons in terms of productivity and purity of the final product.

This article provides an overview of conventional and developing gas processing technologies for CO2 and N2 removal from natural gas.  We consider process technologies based on absorption, distn., adsorption, membrane sepn. and hydrates.  For each technol., we describe the fundamental sepn. mechanisms involved and the commonly applied process flow schemes designed to produce pipeline quality gas (typically 2% CO2, <3% N2) and gas to feed a cryogenic gas plant (typically 50 ppmv CO2, 1% N2).  Amine absorption technologies for CO2 and H2S removal (acid gas treating) are well-established in the natural gas industry.  The advantages and disadvantages of the conventional amine- and phys.-solvent-based processes for acid gas treating are discussed.  The use of CO2 selective membrane technologies for bulk sepn. of CO2 is increasing in the natural gas industry.  Novel low-temp. CO2 removal technologies such as ExxonMobil's Controlled Freeze Zone\u00ae process and rapid cycle pressure swing adsorption processes are also emerging as alternatives to amine scrubbers in certain applications such as for processing high CO2 concn. gases and for developing remote gas fields.  Cryogenic distn. remains the leading N2 rejection technol. for large scale (feed rates greater than 15 MMscfd) natural gas and liquefied natural gas plants.  However, technologies based on CH4 selective absorption and adsorption, as well as N2 selective pressure swing adsorption technologies, are com. available for smaller scale gas processing facilities.

The results indicate that the prepd. activated carbons were mainly amorphous and only a few impurity groups were adsorbed on their surfaces.  The texture property test reveals that the activated carbons displayed different texture properties, esp. the micropore size distribution.  The adsorption capacities of the activated carbons were investigated by adsorbing CH4, CO2, N2 and O2 at 25 \u00b0C in the pressure range of 0-200 kPa.  The results reveal that all the activated carbons had high CO2 adsorption capacity, one of which had the highest CO2 adsorption value of 2.55 mmol/g at 200 kPa.  And the highest adsorption capacity for CH4 of the activated carbons can reach 1.93 mmol/g at 200 kPa.  In the pressure range of 0-200 kPa, the adsorption capacities for N2 and O2 were increased linearly with the change of pressure and K-AC is an excellent adsorbent towards the adsorption sepn. of greenhouse gases.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhsVSqsLvL&md5=e68deac6f9cf0f4130d0b312926a247c", "24.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from large point sources such as power plants is one option for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions; however, currently the capture alone will increase the energy requirements of a plant by 25-40%.  This review highlights the challenges for capture technologies which have the greatest likelihood of reducing CO2 emissions to the atm., namely postcombustion (predominantly CO2/N2 sepn.), precombustion (CO2/H2) capture, and natural gas sweetening (CO2/CH4).  The key factor which underlies significant advancements lies in improved materials that perform the sepns.  In this regard, the most recent developments and emerging concepts in CO2 sepns. by solvent absorption, chem. and phys. adsorption, and membranes, amongst others, will be discussed, with particular attention on progress in the burgeoning field of metal-org. frameworks.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhtVaqu7fL&md5=96d81f8aa4797c4de5bd02965fa9fa5f", "26.
