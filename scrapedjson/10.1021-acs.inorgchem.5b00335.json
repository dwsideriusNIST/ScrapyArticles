Commensurate adsorption is an interesting and important phenomenon occurring during adsorption processes, where the mol. size and shape of the adsorbate (guest mol.) lead to an orientation and adsorbed amt.

As a new type of adsorbate material with distinctly advantageous features, microporous metal org. frameworks (MMOFs) demonstrate enormous potential for adsorption based applications, including storage, sepn., and purifn. of small gases and hydrocarbons.  Commensurate adsorption of hydrocarbons occurs far more often in MMOFs than in zeolites and related materials, primarily as a result of a vastly greater variety of framework types and richer hierarchy of complexity of the pore structures for the former.

The structural detail of its 0-dimensional analog Mg-MOF-2 [Mg(2,4-PDC)(H2O)3] is discussed to show how subtle variation in the ligand architecture changes the resulting structure from 0-dimensional to 3D.  Mg-MOF-1 remains robust and porous upon evacuation of the coordinating water mols.  This is the 1st report of a chiral hexagonal Mg-MOF synthesized from an achiral org. building unit.  Open Mg metal sites show selective hydrogen (H2) adsorption (\u223c0.8% at 77 K) and carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake (\u223c0.7 mmol g-1 at 298 K) over nitrogen at 1 atm.

However, since a few years ago the hydrothermal stability of several MOFs such as MIL-101(Cr), MIL-53(Al) and ZIF-8 has been demonstrated and, hence, they can be used as solid catalysts in the aqueous phase.  The present review is aimed at showing that there are a sufficiently large number of reports proving that certain MOFs can be used as reusable catalysts in water as the solvent.  The use of water as the solvent has considerable advantages from the environmental point of view and affordability.  Water can be the solvent of choice for hydrolytic processes, but MOFs have been reported as catalysts in water even for esterifications and C-C couplings.

This review article presents the fundamental and practical aspects of water adsorption in Metal-Org. Frameworks (MOFs).  The state of the art of MOF stability in water, a crucial issue to many applications in which MOFs are promising candidates, is discussed here.  Stability in both gaseous (such as humid gases) and aq. media is considered.  By considering a non-exhaustive yet representative set of MOFs, the different mechanisms of water adsorption in this class of materials are presented: reversible and continuous pore filling, irreversible and discontinuous pore filling through capillary condensation, and irreversibility arising from the flexibility and possible structural modifications of the host material.  Water adsorption properties of more than 60 MOF samples are reported.  The applications of MOFs as materials for heat-pumps and adsorbent-based chillers and proton conductors are also reviewed.

Metal org. frameworks (MOFs) have a strong potential for gas adsorption and sepn. such as H2 and CH4 storage, and CO2 capture.  However, their instability in the presence of water vapor (many MOFs are hygroscopic) is one of the key issues that limit their large-scale application.  Previous studies of water adsorption in MOFs have mainly relied on isotherm measurements that provide useful parameters such as adsorption uptake and isosteric heat of adsorption.  The structural stability of MOFs in water vapor was also evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (PXRD).  However, more studies are required to unravel the water interaction or reaction mechanisms within MOFs, which would be beneficial for the development of more robust frameworks.  This review highlight focuses on water adsorption in two representative MOFs: M(bdc)(ted)0.5 [M = Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+; bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; ted = triethylenediamine] with satd. metal centers and MOF-74 [M2(dobdc), M = Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and dobdc = 2,5-dihydroxybenzenedicarboxylic acid] with unsatd. metal centers.  It shows how vibrational spectroscopy combined with van der Waals d. functional (vdW-DF) calcns. makes it possible to elucidate the details of water reaction in MOFs.  The results presented in this highlight suggest that the reactivity and initial decompn. pathway of MOFs in water vapor critically depend on their structure and the specific metal cation in the building units.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.

The study illustrates the enormous impact of the functional groups in enhancing CO2 capture in the pressure range 0.01-0.5 bar and at room temp.
