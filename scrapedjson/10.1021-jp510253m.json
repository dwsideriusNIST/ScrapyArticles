Calcd. hydrogen uptake isotherms and isosteric heats of adsorption, Qst, were in quant. agreement with expt. only for the model with explicit polarization.  This success in reproducing empirical measurements suggests that modeling MOFs that have open metal sites is feasible, though it is often not considered to be well described via a classical potential function; here it is shown that such systems may be accurately described by explicitly including polarization effects in an otherwise traditional empirical potential.  Decompn. of energy terms for the models revealed deviations between the electrostatic and polarizable results that are unexpected due to just the augmentation of the potential surface by the addn. of induction.  Charge-quadrupole and induction energetics were shown to have a synergistic interaction, with inclusion of the latter resulting in a significant increase in the former.  Induction interactions strongly influence the structure of the sorbed hydrogen compared to the models lacking polarizability; sorbed hydrogen is a dipolar dense fluid in the MOF.

The MOF is a decorated/substituted isostructural analog to the unembellished rht-MOF, PCN-61, that was studied previously.  The simulations were performed using three different hydrogen potentials of increasing complexity.  Simulated hydrogen sorption isotherms and calcd. isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, values were in excellent agreement with the reported exptl. data for only a polarizable model in one of four exptl. obsd. crystal structure configurations.  The study demonstrates the ability of modeling to distinguish the differential sorption of distinct structures; one configuration is found to be dominant due to favorable interactions with substrates.  In addn., the presence of polar amide groups had a significant effect on the electrostatics of the Cu2+ ions and directs the low-pressure physisorption of hydrogen in the MOF.  This is in contrast to what was obsd. in PCN-61, where an exterior copper ion had a higher relative charge and was the favored loading site.  This tunability of the electrostatics of the copper ions via chem. substitution on the MOF framework can be explained by the presence of the neg. charged oxygen atom of the amide group that causes the interior Cu2+ ion to exhibit a higher pos. charge through an inductive effect.  Further, control simulations, taking advantage of the flexibility afforded by theor. modeling, include artificially modified charges for both Cu2+ ions chosen equal to or with a higher charge on the exterior Cu2+ ion.  This choice resulted in distinctly different hydrogen sorption characteristics in Cu-TPBTM with no direct sorption on the open-metal sites.  Thus, this study demonstrates both the tunable nature of MOF platforms and the possibility for rational design of sorption/catalytic sites and characteristics through the active interplay of theory and expt.

Here we present combined inelastic neutron scattering measurements and detailed first-principles calcns. aimed at unraveling the nature of hydrogen adsorption in HKUST-1 (Cu3(1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate)2), a metal-org. framework (MOF) with unsatd. metal centers.  We reveal that, in this system, the major contribution to the overall binding comes from the classical Coulomb interaction which is not screened due to the open metal site; this explains the relatively high binding energies and short H2-metal distances obsd. in MOFs with exposed metal sites as compared to traditional ones.  Despite the short distances, there is no indication of an elongation of the H-H bond for the bound H2 mol. at the metal site.  We find that both the phonon and rotational energy levels of the hydrogen mol. are closely similar, making the interpretation of the inelastic neutron scattering data difficult.  Finally, we show that the orientation of H2 has a surprisingly large effect on the binding potential, reducing the classical binding energy by almost 30%.  The implication of these results for the development of MOF materials for better hydrogen storage is discussed.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXptVyhtLs%253D&md5=a7342f714e67000e9dadbef8c562ff23", "63.

Frameworks (MOFs) contg. open metal sites (OMS) was systematically studied using volumetric gas porosimetry and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation.  The ten MOFs considered are grouped into two series.  The 1st, MOF-74-x, is based upon MOF-74/CPO-27, which has divalent metal ions Mg, Co, Ni, and Zn, and was chosen to explore the effect of metal identity within a const. topol.  The 2nd series, nbo-MOFs, consists of NOTT-100, NOTT-101, NOTT-102, NOTT-103, and PCN-14 and probes the effect of pore size while maintaining const. OMS identity and similar coordination environment.  Comparisons of the nbo-MOFs with HKUST-1 are also made, since this MOF has a similar chem. structure, although the topol. is different from the nbo structures.  Gas uptake and Henry's const. (kH) for nbo-MOFs increase with decreasing pore size, and as pore size decreases, the effect of gas polarizability on kH becomes more profound.  This implies that tailored pore size can strongly influence kH, esp. for the more polarizable gases Kr and Xe.  A detailed anal. of the void space in the nbo-series reveals large cages connected by narrow pores, resulting in tortuous, zigzag diffusion pathways that likely increase the strength of the MOF-gas interaction.  Data for the MOF-74-x series show that both the d. of OMS and their accessibility in this topol. enhance the framework interaction with the noble gases.  However, because the interaction is largely due to (point charge)-(induced-dipole) interactions and the charge on the metal ion varies little, the specific identity of the metal ion is relatively unimportant.  Consequently, new MOFs tailored to maximize noble gas uptake from air should target structures with both a high d. of OMS and pores that are approaching the size of the gas of interest.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXos1Wltb0%253D&md5=afe2dd4e7052e771e1c3bc27cd2446ae"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-2/jp510253m/20150109/images/small/jp-2014-10253m_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-2/jp510253m/20150109/images/small/jp-2014-10253m_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-2/jp510253m/20150109/images/small/jp-2014-10253m_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-2/jp510253m/20150109/images/small/jp-2014-10253m_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-2/jp510253m/20150109/images/small/jp-2014-10253m_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-2/jp510253m/20150109/images/small/jp-2014-10253m_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-2/jp510253m/20150109/images/small/jp-2014-10253m_0007.gif\">"]}
