Its 3 D framework is built up of infinite trans chains of corner-sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra.  The chains are interconnected by the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate groups, creating 1 D rhombic-shaped tunnels.  Disordered 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid mols. are trapped inside these tunnels.  Their evacuation upon heating, between 275 and 420\u00b0, leads to a nanoporous open-framework (MIL-53ht (Al) or Al(OH)[O2CC6H4CO2]) with empty pores of diam. 8.5 \u00c5.  This solid exhibits a Langmuir surface area. of 1590(1) m2g-1 together with a remarkable thermal stability, since it starts to decomp. only at 500\u00b0.  At room temp., the solid reversibly absorbs H2O in its tunnels, causing a very large breathing effect and shrinkage of the pores.  Anal. of the hydration process by solid-state NMR (1H, 13C, 27Al) has clearly indicated that the trapped H2O mols. interact with the carboxylate groups through H bonds, but do not affect the hydroxyl species bridging the Al atoms.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.

We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.

In all these applications, the stability of these composites at progressively increasing temps. is an important parameter to det. their condition of usage.  This work investigates the nature and strength of the stabilizing host/guest interactions at the basis of the exceptional stability of the methyl red@palygorskite composite system, which undergo a dynamic but reversible evolution depending on the level of heating.  A multitechnique anal. protocol involving synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (S-XRPD) and thermogravimetric anal. (TGA) coupled with IR spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatog.

Cooling below 300 \u00b0C implies gradual reversibility of the obsd. trend due to rehydration from environmental moisture; addnl. heating (>400 \u00b0C), conversely, causes methyl red decompn., fragmentation, and further expulsion from the host tunnels (\u223c500 \u00b0C).

Exptl. evidences suggest that modified methyl red mols., in the form of specific zwitterions and/or altered trans-isomers, can diffuse inside the palygorskite tunnels or superficial grooves once zeolitic H2O is removed due to heating or vacuum.  The dye is likely to interact with the palygorskite framework by means of several bond types, which include H-bonding to Mg-coordinated OH2 and electrostatic forces, responsible for the compd. stability.  Sorption in the hosting matrix enhances both the photo- and thermal stability of methyl red and increases steadiness of the palygorskite structure by preventing folding with progressive heating.

This phenomenon is called pos. thermal expansion (PTE) and usually occurs along all three crystallog. axes.  In very rare cases, structural peculiarities may give rise either to anomalously large PTE, or to neg. thermal expansion (NTE, when lattice dimensions shrink with heating).  As NTE and unusually large PTE are extremely uncommon for mol. solids, mechanisms that might give rise to such phenomena are poorly understood.  Here the authors show that the packing arrangement of a simple dumbbell-shaped org. mol., coupled with its intermol. interactions, facilitates a cooperative mech. response of the three-dimensional framework to changes in temp.  A series of detailed structural detns. was performed at 15-K intervals to visualize the process at the mol. level.  The underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a three-dimensional folding trellis and results in exceptionally large and reversible uniaxial PTE and biaxial NTE of the crystal.

The resulting porous org. polymers showed permanent porosity with BET surface areas of around 1000 m2 g-1.  More importantly, these polymers exhibit fully reversible responsive pore size distribution and CO2 uptake triggered by UV irradn. or heat treatment.  We obsd. the transformation of some micropores with pore size around 14 \u00b0 to larger ones (17 \u00b0) upon UV irradn.  Although the BET surface areas remain almost const. during the isomerization process, trans to cis conversion of the azobenzene groups significantly increases CO2 uptake (up to 29% at 273 K and 1 atm) of the frameworks.  Our study on the structure-property relationship shows that the bulkiness of the azobenzene moieties reduces the extent of responsiveness of the materials.  Such a photoresponsive behavior is largely attributed to the enhanced dipole-quadrapole interaction between CO2 and the frameworks due to the increased dipole moment of cis -N=N- groups compared to trans -N=N-.  Such responsiveness significantly differs from the previously reported responsive MOFs contg. azobenzene groups, which release CO2 upon trans to cis isomerization.  These polymers thus represent a new class of porous polymers having intriguing stimuli-responsive properties for advanced applications.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXhsVSqtL%252FE&md5=b79796b92c548fe5e85474cbb894771a"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-23/acs.chemmater.5b02211/20151202/images/small/cm-2015-02211t_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-23/acs.chemmater.5b02211/20151202/images/small/cm-2015-02211t_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-23/acs.chemmater.5b02211/20151202/images/small/cm-2015-02211t_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-23/acs.chemmater.5b02211/20151202/images/small/cm-2015-02211t_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-23/acs.chemmater.5b02211/20151202/images/small/cm-2015-02211t_0003.gif\">"]}
