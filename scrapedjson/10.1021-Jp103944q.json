This approach was first used by Momany", "(3)", " and further refined by several others.", "(5-8)", " The well-known method CHELP was initially developed by Chirlian and Francl,", "(9)", " and then modified by Breneman and Wiberg", "(10)", " as the CHELPG method.

Specifically, long-range electrostatics must be accounted for in the periodic system, buried atoms are a more common problem, and the ESP is only determined to within a constant value that depends on the details of the electronic structure code used to generate the ESP. Most simulation studies that include charges for crystalline systems have obtained those charges from ab initio calculations on representative \u201cgas phase\u201d clusters or fragments taken from the crystal lattice.", "(12-22)", " There are two obvious problems with this approach. Convergence of the atomic charges with the size of the cluster may be very slow, so that the calculations become computationally infeasible. Moreover, even when charges on atoms converge, there are always terminating atoms on clusters and these terminating atoms carry at least some charge, making it necessary to renormalize the charges on the periodic atoms to achieve charge neutrality. This renormalization step is not unique, which introduces additional uncertainty into the process.", " ", "Thus, there is a need for robust and accurate methods for computing atomic charges for periodic systems. One possible solution is to use an approach based on partitioning the electron density around each atom, rather than the electrostatic potential. These types of methods are typically based on the atoms-in-molecules theory developed by Bader.", "(2, 23)", " The atomic charge is determined by taking the difference between the formal valence charge and the sum of the electron partitioned density in an all-electron calculation.

Their method, called density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) charges, overcomes many of the shortcomings of the Bader approach by requiring the atomic charges to be chemically meaningful and to reproduce the ESP at points that are sufficiently far from the atoms in the system. The DDEC method is able to produce physically meaningful charges for nonporous solids, for porous materials, such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and for complex molecular systems. In contrast to ESP fitting methods, the DDEC method does not have problems assigning charges for buried atoms.

The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermol. interaction properties of mols. with a simple two-body additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of quantum mech. calcn. is used to derive the ESP around the mol.  Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferably between common functional groups in related mols., they have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramol. interactions.  Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems, with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to the quantum mech. ESP.  Several other refinements in addn. to the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit yield a general and algorithmic charge fitting procedure for generating atom-centered point charges.

Conventional ESP fitting procedures developed for mol. systems, in general, will not work for cryst. systems because the electrostatic potential in periodic systems is ill-defined up to a const. offset at each spatial position.  In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its abs. values, as it is currently done with mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  We formally demonstrate that the new functional reduces to the conventional error functional used in mol.

For the periodic calcn. of isolated mols., the REPEAT charges are found to be in good agreement with those detd. with established mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional mol. ESP approaches generate 'unphys.' charges, whereas the REPEAT method produces charges that are both chem. intuitive and consistent between different periodic electronic structure packages.  The new approach is employed to generate partial at. charges of various microporous materials and compared to both exptl. derived and mol. fragment ESP charges.

Ewald summation techniques were reviewed by surveying conventional as well as state of the art efficient methods.  Conventional methods, such as tabulation and approxn., are first re-examd. along with an O(N3/2) method.  Fourier-based approaches which have reduced the complexity to O(Nlog (N)) are presented.  Multipole expansion techniques, suggested as an alternative to Ewald sums, are reviewed and compared to Fourier methods.  The computational efficiency of these new methods facilitates longer, larger and more realistic simulations.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28XivFOjurg%253D&md5=36d77cae2048e19d3f000db435a589a8", " ", "45.

It is shown the charges strongly depend on how and where the potential points are selected.  Two alternative methods are suggested to avoid the arbitrariness in the point-selection schemes and van der Waals exclusion radii: CHELP-BOW, which also ests. the charges from the electrostatic potential, but with potential points that are Boltzmann-weighted after their occurrence in actual simulations using the energy function of the program in which the charges will be used, and CHELMO, which ests. the charges directly from the electrostatic multipole moments.  Different criteria for the quality of the charges are discussed.  The CHELMO method gives the best multipole moments for small and medium-sized polar systems, whereas the CHELP-BOW charges reproduce best the total interaction energy in actual simulations.  Among the std. methods, the Merz-Kollman charges give the best moments and potentials, but they show an appreciable dependence on the orientation of the mol.  We have also examd. the recent warning that charges derived by a least-squares fit to the electrostatic potential normally are not statistically valid.  It is shown that no rank-deficiency problems are encountered for mols. with up to 84 atoms if the least-squares fit is performed using pseudoinverses calcd. by singular value decompn. and if constraints are treated by elimination.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1cXhs1aktb0%253D&md5=3084c9f9ca9ff2fec8cf0c2bcaa56bfd", " ", " "], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcafh/2010/jpcafh.2010.114.issue-37/jp103944q/production/images/small/jp-2010-03944q_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcafh/2010/jpcafh.2010.114.issue-37/jp103944q/production/images/small/jp-2010-03944q_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcafh/2010/jpcafh.2010.114.issue-37/jp103944q/production/images/small/jp-2010-03944q_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcafh/2010/jpcafh.2010.114.issue-37/jp103944q/production/images/small/jp-2010-03944q_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcafh/2010/jpcafh.2010.114.issue-37/jp103944q/production/images/small/jp-2010-03944q_0005.gif\">"]}
