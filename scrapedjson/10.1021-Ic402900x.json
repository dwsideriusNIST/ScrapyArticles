This latter process is dominant for all discussed energy transfer pathways.

The white light Na Gd tungstate phosphor contains 3 emission bands: the blue-green band at 468 nm is ascribed to the ligand to metal charge transfer transition from O\u2192W; the orange band at 590 nm and red band at 610 nm are attributed to the 5D\u21927F1 and 5D\u21927F2 transitions of Eu3+.  The luminescence color can be tuned from blue to white to red by adjusting the doping concn. of Eu3+.  Both scanning electron and TEM indicate that the obtained microspheres have a uniform particle size distribution.  The 3-dimensional NaGdWO4(OH)x:Eu3+ pompon-shaped structures were constructed layer-by-layer from a large no. of 2-dimensional nanoflakes with a mean diam. of \u223c100 nm.  The whole time-dependent process is interpreted as an example of self-assembly process.  The emission spectra are dominated by a 5D\u21927F2 transition of Eu3+.  The optimum concn. for the white light was to keep the ratio of Eu3+ and Gd3+ at \u223c0.02.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXptQ%253D%253D&md5=570e8251c8fc8b82da1b17253b54d27e", "31.
