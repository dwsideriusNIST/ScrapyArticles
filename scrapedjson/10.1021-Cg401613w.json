The remaining objective, trying to find a MOF able to strongly confining H", "2", " molecules, was probably the most ambitious challenge because of the difficultness of storing such a hardly compressible gas molecule having such a low critical temperature (32.97 K).

More interestingly, there is an extremely good match between the amount of adsorbed H", "2", " before the inflection point (up to 0.05 bar) and the number of H", "2", " molecules fitted into the nanocavities of ITF-1, as estimated from the crystallographically solved structure, both being four H", "2", " molecules per D4R cube.

This means that the cube-shaped nanocavities of ITF-1 are exceptional confiners of H", "2", ", even better than expected when they were designed. Indeed, these cavities are wholly filled with H", "2", " at 77 K under very low pressures (below 0.05 bar). Once the nanocavities are filled with H", "2", ", the capacity of the material ITF-1 for adsorbing H", "2", " is rather limited, as predicted by the low surface area of the material. Nevertheless, the shape of the H", "2", " isotherm at 77 K at higher pressures is also unusual compared with conventional H", "2", " isotherms of some other porous adsorbents under similar conditions. The typical plateau of the conventional (type I) isotherms when micropores are filled is not reached for ITF-1 materials up to 10 bar.

Such design entails, first, the synthesis of the noncommercialized tetrazole- and imidazole-based organic linker and, subsequently, the optimization of the synthesis conditions with indium as the strategically chosen metal. The resultant so-called ITF-1 material made up of metal\u2013organic cubes arranged with ast topology showed the main structural and compositional designed premises. Thanks to this, it was able to adsorb much more of both CO", "2", " and H", "2", " than expected from its relatively low surface area. In addition, the corresponding isotherms had unusual and exciting singularities, which were explained according to its structure. Thus, the CO", "2", " isotherm at 273 K has a prominent hysteresis loop along the whole studied range of pressures (0\u201310 bar), presumably due to the high polarizability of its N-rich organic linker or the nanosize of the cavities of ITF-1. H", "2", " isotherm at 77 K indicated a hierarchical filling, in such a way that each nanocavity is wholly occupied (by four H", "2", " molecules) at very low H", "2", " pressure, and the subsequent adsorption is rather discrete. Finally, the H", "2", " isotherms registered at nearly room temperature (273 K) showed the possibility of completely filling the nanocavities at pressure as low as 10 bar. Despite the absolute values of adsorption of either CO", "2", " or H", "2", " being far from the best among MOFs, this study provides key insights into the design of new MOFs for efficiently adsorbing these gases of high energetic and environmental interest. Additionally, we expect that the detailed rational design behind this noteworthy and successful adsorption result encourages and inspires the MOF scientific community to dedicate enough effort in the design materials of particular physical\u2013chemical properties for reaching concrete objectives to the detriment of simply using trial-and-error strategies just trying to get new structures with scarce practical interest.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

The current great interest in prepg. functional metal-org. materials is inevitably assocd. with tremendous research efforts dedicated to the design and synthesis of new families of sophisticated multi-nucleating ligands.  In this context, the N-donor triazole and tetrazole rings represent two categories of ligands that are increasingly used, most likely as the result of the recent dramatic development of \"click chem.\" and Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs).  Thus, azole-based complexes found numerous applications in coordination chem.  In the present review, the authors focus on the use of 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole ligands to create coordination polymers, metal complexes and spin-crossover compds., reported to the end of 2009.  In the first instance, the authors present a compendium of all the relevant ligands that were employed to generate coordination polymers and Metal-Org. Frameworks (MOFs).  Due to the huge amt. of reported MOFs and coordination polymers bearing these azole rings, three representative examples for each category (therefore nine in total) are described.  The second section is devoted to the use of the bridging abilities of these azole ligands to prep. metal complexes (contg. at least two metal centers).  Given the large no. and the great structural diversity of the polynuclear compds. found in the literature, these were grouped according to their nuclearity.

The results are discussed with respect to the materials' surface area and thermodn. properties of the adsorbed phase.  A nearly linear correlation between the max. hydrogen excess amt. adsorbed and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was evidenced at both temps.  Such a trend suggests that the adsorbed phase on the different materials is similar in nature.  This interpretation is supported by measurements of the adsorbed hydrogen phase properties near satn. at 50 K.  In particular, the adsorbed hydrogen consistently exhibits liq. state properties despite significant structural and chem. differences between the tested adsorbents.  This behavior is viewed as a consequence of mol. confinement in nanoscale pores.  The variability in the trend relating the surface area and the amt. of hydrogen adsorbed could be explained by differences in the adsorbed phase densities.  Importantly, the latter were found to lie in the known range of bulk liq. hydrogen densities.  The chem. compn. and structure (e.g., pore size) were found to influence mainly how the adsorption isotherms increase as a function of pressure.  Finally, the abs. isotherms were calcd. on the basis of measured adsorbed phase vols., allowing for an estn. of the total amts. of hydrogen that can be stored in the microporous vols. at 50 K.  These amts. were found to reach values up to 25% higher than their excess counterparts, and to correlate with the BET surface areas.

The bonding of Cu2+ to the CN group of cyanometallates shows a unique behavior.  The trend of copper to receive electrons in its 3d hole to adopt an electronic configuration close to 3d10 is complemented by the ability of the CN group to donate electrons from its 5\u03c3 orbital, which has certain antibonding character.  Because of this cooperative effect, the electronic configuration of the copper atom at the cavity surface is close to Cu+.  The resulting large availability of electron d. on the copper atom favors its interaction with the antibonding \u03c3* orbital of the hydrogen mol.  The charge removed from the metal t2g orbitals is compensated (donated) by H2 through a side-on \u03c3 interaction.  From these combined mechanisms, where H2 behaves as an acceptor-donor ligand for the copper atom, the high ability that copper hexacyanometallates show for the hydrogen storage could be explained.

Desolvation provides a bimodal porous structure Zn3(BDC)3[Cu(Pyen)] (M'MOF 1) with narrow porosity (<0.56 nm) and an array of pores in the bc crystallog. plane where the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions are maximized by both the presence of open Cu centers and overlap of the potential energy fields from pore walls.  The H2 and D2 adsorption isotherms for M'MOF 1 at 77.3 and 87.3 K were reversible with virtually no hysteresis.  Methods for detn. of the isosteric enthalpies of H2 and D2 adsorption were compared.  A virial model gave the best agreement (av. deviation <1 std. deviation) with the isotherm data.  This was used in conjunction with the van't Hoff isochore giving isosteric enthalpies at zero surface coverage of 12.29 \u00b1 0.53 and 12.44 \u00b1 0.50 kJ mol-1 for H2 and D2 adsorption, resp.

Virial anal. of isotherms at 87.3 K is also consistent with 2 H2 or D2 mols. being bound to each open Cu center.

The D2 adsorption kinetic consts. for both components were significantly faster than the corresponding H2 kinetics for specific pressure increments and had slightly lower activation energies than the corresponding values for H2 adsorption.  The kD2/kH2 ratio for the slow component was 1.62 \u00b1 0.07, while the fast component was 1.38 \u00b1 0.04 at 77.3 K, and the corresponding ratios were smaller at 87.3 K.  These observations of kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving in porous materials are due to the larger zero-point energy for the lighter H2, resulting in slower adsorption kinetics compared with the heavier D2.

Unlike most other MOFs that have been studied for H storage, it has an ionic framework and many small channels.  The simulations demonstrate that it is both of these phys. characteristics that lead to strong H interactions in the MOF and ultimately large H uptake.  Microscopically, H interacts with the MOF via 3 principle attractive potential energy contributions: Van der Waals, charge-quadrupole and induction.  Previous simulations of H storage in MOFs and other materials have not focused on the role of polarization effects, but they are demonstrated here to be the dominant contribution to H physisorption.  Indeed, polarization interactions in the MOF lead to 2 distinct populations of dipolar H that are identified from the simulations and that should be evident in Raman spectra.  Since polarization interactions are enhanced by the presence of a charged framework with narrow pores, MOFs are excellent H storage candidates.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXht1yrtbfK&md5=ff9450f53d18424c86347665dc307c2e", "37.

The results of such comparison show that both adsorptives give the same micropore size distribution (MPSD) for open porosity activated carbons.  This observation confirms that the adsorption mechanism of both adsorptives is similar.  However, carbon mol. sieves, with very narrow microporosity, cannot be characterized by N2 at 77 K, due to the existence of diffusional problems.  This is also extensive to many other carbon materials, such as carbon fibers and activated carbons with low degree of activation.
