Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.  Because we can functionalize the pores to direct their specific recognition of small mols., the emerging porous MOFs serve as novel functional materials for gas storage, sepn., heterogeneous catalysis, and sensing.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlslyhtrs%253D&md5=f9230905a5656f9fe0e487967ecae356", "(i) ", "Zhou", ", ", "H.-C.", "; ", "Long", ", ", "J.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.

However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

It is shown that, for ambient temp. storage of hydrogen and delivery between 30 and 1.5 bar pressure, for the optimum adsorbent the adsorption enthalpy change is 15.1 kJ/mol.  For carbons, for which the av. enthalpy change is typically 5.8 kJ/mol, an optimum operating temp. of about 115 K is predicted.  For methane, an optimum enthalpy change of 18.8 kJ/mol is found, with the optimum temp. for carbons being 254 K.  It is also demonstrated that for max. delivery of the gas the optimum adsorbent must be homogeneous, and that introduction of heterogeneity, such as by ball milling, irradn., and other means, can only provide small increases in physisorption-related delivery for hydrogen.  For methane, heterogeneity is always detrimental, at any value of av. adsorption enthalpy change.  These results are confirmed with the help of exptl. data from the literature, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations conducted here using slit pore models of activated carbons as well as atomistic models of carbon nanotubes.

The interaction of mol. oxygen with titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces plays a key role in many technol. important processes such as catalytic oxidn. reactions, chem. sensing, and photocatalysis.  While O2 interacts weakly with fully oxidized TiO2, excess electrons are often present in TiO2 samples.  These excess electrons originate from intrinsic reducing defects (oxygen vacancies and titanium interstitials), doping, or photoexcitation and form polaronic Ti3+ states in the band gap near the bottom of the conduction band.  Oxygen adsorption involves the transfer of one or more of these excess electrons to an O2 mol. at the TiO2 surface.  This results in an adsorbed superoxo (O2-) or peroxo (O22-) species or in mol. dissocn. and formation of two oxygen adatoms (2 \u00d7 O2-).  Oxygen adsorption is also the first step toward oxygen incorporation, a fundamental reaction that strongly affects the chem. properties and charge-carrier densities; for instance, it can transform the material from an n-type semiconductor to a poor electronic conductor.  In this Account, we present an overview of recent theor. work on O2 adsorption and reactions on the reduced anatase (101) surface.  Anatase is the TiO2 polymorph that is generally considered most active in photocatalysis.  Expts. on anatase powders have shown that the properties of photoexcited electrons are similar to those of excess electrons from reducing defects, and therefore, oxygen on reduced anatase is also a model system for studying the role of O2 in photocatalysis.  Exptl., the characteristic Ti3+ defect states disappear after adsorption of mol. oxygen, which indicates that the excess electrons are indeed trapped by O2.  Moreover, superoxide surface species assocd. with two different cation surface sites, possibly a regular cation site and a cation close to an anion vacancy, were identified by ESR spectroscopy.  On the theor. side, however, d. functional theory studies have consistently found that it is energetically more favorable for O2 to adsorb in the peroxo form rather than the superoxo form.  As a result, obtaining a detailed understanding of the nature of the obsd. superoxide species has proven difficult for many years.  On reduced anatase (101), both oxygen vacancies and Ti interstitials have been shown to reside exclusively in the subsurface.  We discuss how reaction of O2 with a subsurface O vacancy heals the vacancy while leading to the formation of a surface bridging dimer defect.  Similarly, the interaction of O2 with a Ti interstitial causes migration of this defect to the surface and the formation of a surface TiO2 cluster.  Finally, we analyze the peroxo and superoxo states of the adsorbed mol.  On the basis of periodic hybrid functional calcns. of interfacial electron transfer between reduced anatase and O2, we show that the peroxide form, while energetically more stable, is kinetically less favorable than the superoxide form.  The existence of a kinetic barrier between the superoxo and peroxo states is essential for explaining a variety of exptl. observations.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXmsVGmtLk%253D&md5=ae68928713e50037df2e10b8010994ec", "35.

We were not able to produce thermally stable superoxide on albite, in contrast to the results of Yen et al., who reported the generation of O-2 that was stable up to 200\u00b0C on labradorite, another common feldspar.  The superoxide radical did form under UV irradn. at 77 K on albite that was not dehydrated but decayed rapidly at room temp.  On dehydrated albite, no superoxide signal was obsd.  We studied the kinetics of O-2 decompn. on hydrated albite and derived an activation energy, Ea = 15.2 kJ/mol.  Assuming pseudo first-order kinetics, a simple thermal model of Mars' regolith demonstrates that the surface O-2 population does not go to zero overnight; superoxide extinction at the surface is only complete when the seasonal CO2 cap covers the surface and surface photolysis is inhibited.  Depending on the specific quantum efficiency of the e-/h+ generation process, a finite, non-equil. population of O-2 should be observable on Martian surface materials throughout the Martian year.  However, on the basis of our inability to generate stable O-2 on hydrated albite via direct UV irradn., we do not believe that this mechanism is capable of explaining the O2 release in the Viking Gas Exchange (GEx) results, since O2 release in that case was obsd. even after samples had been stored for 143 sols in the dark at 10\u00b0C, then heated to 145\u00b0C for 3 h.  At least two other potential pathways to the generation of O-2 are identified in this article.  The first possibility is that metal oxides common on the Martian surface, particularly hematite, may be photoactive on Mars and play a role analogous to TiO2 in surface catalysis.

In the dehydrated state, most of the Ti4+ ions have the tetrapodal (Ti(OSi)4) or the tripodal (Ti(OSi)3OH) structure.  On contact with H2O2, titanium oxo species, Ti(O2H) and Ti(O.-2), resp., are formed.  On reaction with org. reactants, O-O bond cleavage in these titanium oxo species occurs in a hetero- or homolytic manner.  Product selectivity is detd. by the relative importance of these two modes of O-O cleavage.  Factors such as the coordinative environment of titanium, substituents on the O-O bond (H or alkyl), temp., solvent, nature of the org. reactant, etc. influence the mode of O-O cleavage.
