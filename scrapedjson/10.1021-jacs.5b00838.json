Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), highly cryst. porous materials constructed by metal ions and org. ligands, have emerged as a class of excellent adsorbent materials for carbon capture.  Great progress in MOF materials for CO2 capture has been made in the past and reviewed accordingly, but new discoveries are constantly being made as the field quickly grows.  In this paper, we provide a short review on the most recent advances in using MOFs for CO2 adsorption, storage, and sepn. that are directly related to CO2 capture.  Some of the important properties of MOF adsorbents which are crucial for practical applications but are largely overlooked in research carried out so far are discussed.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhvVahsbvN&md5=8241a13fae92d606749b881241210d63", "(f) ", "Liu", ", ", "J.", "; ", "Thallapally", ", ", "P.

D. functional theory calcns. indicate that the binding energy between CO2 and HKUST-1 with coordinated water is \u223c1 kcal/mol higher than that without coordinated water.

On the other hand, the enhanced selectivity induced by uncoordinated water in the flue gas mixt. can be explained on the basis of the competition of adsorption sites between water and CO2 (N2).  At low pressures, a significant CO2/N2 selectivity increase is due to the increase of CO2 adsorption and decrease of N2 adsorption as a consequence of competition of adsorption sites between water and N2.  However, with more water mols. adsorbed at higher pressures, the competition between water and CO2 leads to the decrease of CO2 adsorption capacity.

In this study, the capture of CO2 from a 12% synthetic flue gas stream at a relative humidity of 95% at 30\u00b0 was exptl. examd.  A 13X adsorbent was used and the migration of the water and its subsequent impact on capture performance was evaluated.  Binary breakthrough of CO2/water vapor was performed and indicated a significant effect of water on CO2 adsorption capacity, as expected.  Cyclic expts. indicate that the water zone migrates a quarter of the way into the column and stabilizes its position so that CO2 capture is still possible although decreased.  The formation of a water zone creates a \"cold spot\" which has implications for the system performance.  The recovery of CO2 dropped from 78.5 to 60% when moving from dry to wet flue gas while the productivity dropped by 22%.  Although the concn. of water leaving the bed under vacuum was 27%(vol), the low vacuum pressure prevented condensation of water in this stream.  However, the vacuum pump acted as a condenser and separator to remove bulk water.  An important consequence of the presence of a water zone was to elevate the vacuum level thereby reducing CO2 working capacity.  Thus although there is a detrimental effect of water on CO2 capture, long term recovery of CO2 is still possible in a single VSA process.  Pre-drying of the flue gas steam is not required.  However, careful consideration of the impact of water and accommodation thereof must be made particularly when the feed stream temp. increases resulting in higher feed water concn.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXjsFajs7s%253D&md5=504905ed7b8b4a30e4bde8f1006d63f2", "25.

The technique consists of first calibrating the IR absorption peak areas with known adsorbed amts. of the different components in the adsorbate mixt. using single gases/vapors.  By measuring the IR peak areas of the adsorbates on the sorbent in contact with the gas mixt., the actual amts. of the sorbate can be detd.  The method is fairly simple, quick, and accurate even at low concns. provided the adsorbates exhibit strong distinct peaks and the sorbent is at least partially IR-transparent.  The utility of this method is demonstrated by measuring the binary gas adsorption of CO2 and H2O-vapor at low concns. on two adsorbents: 13X (NaX) zeolite mol. sieve, and \u03b3-Al2O3.  In the low CO2 concn. range, the amt. of CO2 adsorbed seemed to be significantly enhanced in the presence of H2O in trace amts.  The adsorption data was fit to the Doong-Yang potential theory model, and the ideal (and real) adsorbed soln. theory (IAS) of A. L. Myers and J. M. Prausnitz (1965), with the Dubinin-Astakhov equation as the basis.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXlsVKhtL8%253D&md5=50947a31f8d49f2927ee205c26338bda", "(b) ", "Cai", ", ", "B.-C.", "; ", "Han", ", ", "Q.-J.", "; ", "Tang", ", ", "L.-J.", "; ", "Zhang", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Yu", ", ", "R.-Q.", " ", "Ind.

Therefore, the development of more efficient processes, such as membrane processes and improved adsorbents, for the sepn. of carbon dioxide and water from biogas and natural gas is of great importance.  Zeolite ZSM-5 membranes are promising for this sepn. which is controlled by the adsorption and diffusion of the different species in the zeolite.  Multicomponent adsorption data are therefore required for development of new membrane and adsorption processes.  In the present work, the adsorption of water, carbon dioxide, and methane in a Na-ZSM-5 zeolite film at various temps. was studied by in situ Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform IR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy for the first time.  Adsorption isotherms were retrieved from the exptl. data and the Langmuir model fitted the isotherms very well.

A few expts. were conducted with multicomponent mixts. and the exptl. detd. amts. adsorbed were compared with values predicted by the Ideal Adsorbed Soln. Theory (IAST).  It was found that for the binary mixt. of carbon dioxide and methane there was good agreement between the exptl. values and those predicted by the IAST.  However, when water was also introduced, the IAST could not fully capture the adsorption behavior of the multicomponent mixt., probably because the adsorbed phase is not ideal.

The results provide a mechanistic framework for designing highly efficient adsorbents for removing CO2 from various gas mixts., and yield insights into the conservation of Mg2+ within the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase family of enzymes.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2MXks1yqsb8%253D&md5=0fb7804470adfc70c4c0a482a10678af"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0016.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0017.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0012.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0013.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0014.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-14/jacs.5b00838/20150409/images/small/ja-2015-008388_0015.gif\">"]}
