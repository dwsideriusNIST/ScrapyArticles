We use grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation for modeling of CO2 adsorption at 298 K and pressures up to 5.7 MPa.  It is shown that both gravimetric and volumetric uptake of CO2 strongly depend on the pore size in nanotubes but not on their chiral vector.  Moreover, for any operating storage pressure, a unique optimal size of carbon nanotubes is well-defined.  At 1.5 MPa, the most efficient nanotubes that maximize both gravimetric and volumetric uptake of CO2 (i.e., 13.6 mmol g-1 and 11.4 mol dm-3) have diams. of 3.8 nm.  This size corresponds to the (28,28) armchair nanotubes.  For a higher operating pressure of 3.5 MPa, the optimal diam. of carbon nanotubes is slightly shifted up to 4.8 nm (i.e., 25.3 mmol g-1 and 16.7 mol dm-3).  This size corresponds to the (36,36) armchair nanotubes.  We demonstrate that to make an objective statement about the efficiency of CO2 storage in any nanoporous material, the complete volumetric and gravimetric adsorption data are necessary.  Taking this into account, we discuss the recently reported exceptionally high capacity of metal-org. frameworks.

Ref. isotherms of N2, Ar, and CO2 in a series of model slit-shaped C pores in the range from 0.3-36 nm were calcd. from the nonlocal d. functional theory (NLDFT) using validated parameters of intermol. interactions.  CO2 isotherms were also generated by the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method based on the 3-center model of Harris and Yung.  The validation of model parameters includes 3 steps: (1) prediction of vapor-liq. equil. data in the bulk system, (2) prediction of adsorption isotherm on graphite surface, (3) comparison of the NLDFT adsorption isotherms in pores to those of GCMC simulations, performed with the parameters of fluid-fluid interactions, which accurately reproduce vapor-liq. equil. data of the bulk fluid.  Pore size distributions are calcd. by an adaptable procedure of deconvolution of the integral adsorption equation using regularization methods.  The deconvolution procedure implies the same grid of pore sizes and relative pressures for all adsorbates and the intelligent choice of regularization parameters.  The consistency of the approach was demonstrated on examples of pore structure characterization of activated C from adsorption isotherms of different gases and from different models (NLDFT and GCMC).  Since the CO2 isotherms measured up to 1 atm are not sensitive to pores wider then 1 nm, the NLDFT method for CO2 was extended to high-pressure CO2 adsorption up to 34 atm.

In parallel, numerical methods, based on empirical force-fields, are employed to calc. the adsorption of methane in bundles of nanotubes and neutron diffraction patterns based on these structures.  Adsorption sites in grooves on the outer surface of bundles and on the curved surfaces of the nanotubes are characterized by their binding energy and relative abundance.  Comparison with published adsorption isotherms indicate that the more stable groove sites must also be complemented by interstitial sites.  Such sites are found to be energetically unfavorable in homogeneous bundles composed of av. diam. nanotubes, but can become favorable in bundles made of bigger diam. tubes and in more realistic, heterogeneous bundles.  Nanotube deformation is an important factor, limiting the size of interstitial channels, but also allowing the stabilization of adsorbed methane mols.  Diffraction patterns calcd. for methane-nanotube structures with partially occupied interstitial sites are in best agreement with the exptl. diffraction data.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXmsVKhu78%253D&md5=058e48e797f41270c8734f8b10ca41ec"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0012.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-26/jp403624c/production/images/small/jp-2013-03624c_0013.gif\">"]}
