The anal. of these expts. requires an efficient tool for the simulation of the DP-PSA system to cyclic steady state (CSS).  In this contribution, a simulation tool is developed and applied to a math. model of the DP-PSA system.  The governing set of partial differential equations (PDEs) is solved with state-of-the-art discretization schemes, which are tailored to the character of the governing equations.  PDEs with a strong hyperbolic character are discretized with the finite vol. method (FVM) with a flux-limiting scheme; this guarantees the conservation of mass as well as correct tracking of the moving fronts.  The mass transfer in the adsorbent materials is discretized with the orthogonal collocation on finite elements method which is a very efficient method for problems with steep, stationary gradients.  The large system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) is solved with the state-of-the-art DAE solver SUNDIALS.  Even with these sophisticated discretization schemes, the computation times to reach CSS are long due to the nonlinear system behavior as well as the complex nature of the system.  Several strategies to reduce the computation time are implemented: (i) conservative node refinement: initial simulation with lower resoln. discretization; (ii) implementation of numerical acceleration schemes, e.g., the extrapolation method, which accelerate the convergence to CSS; (iii) restart from previous simulation runs.  Each of the acceleration schemes reduces the required simulation time by at least a factor of 2, and the combination of the schemes accelerates the simulation by a factor of 10.  Thus, the combined simulation tool allows the rapid simulation of the DP-PSA system.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXjvFeksb8%253D&md5=688c2346f94048af0a153f60be3ba476", "16.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "24.

We found that UiO-66, a prototypical Zr-MOF with high porosity, exhibits unusually high shear stability.  Its minimal shear modulus (Gmin = 13.7 GPa) is an order of magnitude higher than those of other benchmark highly porous MOFs (e.g., MOF-5, ZIF-8, HKUST-1), approaching that of zeolites.

Each type of mols. adsorb preferentially in two different porosities of the material, i.e., while CO2 occupy the tetrahedral cages, CH4 are pushed to the octahedral cages.  Further, a very unusual dynamic behavior was also pointed out with the slower mol., i.e., CO2, enhancing the mobility of the fast one, i.e., CH4, that contrasts with those usually obsd. so far for the CO2/CH4 mixt. in narrow window zeolites where the mols. are most commonly diffusing independently or slowing-down the partner species.  Such behavior was interpreted in light of mol. simulations that evidenced a jump type mechanism involving a tetrahedral cages-octahedral cages-tetrahedral cages sequence that occurs more frequently for CH4 when in presence of CO2.  The consequences in terms of CO2/CH4 selectivity and the possible use of this MOF-type material in a PSA process are then discussed.  It is thus clearly emphasized that this MOF material combines several favorable features including a good selectivity, high working capacity, and potential easy regenerability that make it as a good alternative candidate of the conventional NaX Faujasite used in pressure swing adsorption.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXnvValu7Y%253D&md5=e277534e0e170963336db424f0c44b0a", "35.

By varying the amt. of benzoic or acetic acid, the synthesis of Zr-bdc can be modulated.  With increasing concn. of the modulator, the products change from intergrown to individual crystals, the size of which can be tuned.  Addn. of benzoic acid also affects the size and morphol. of Zr-bpdc and, addnl., makes the synthesis of Zr-bpdc highly reproducible.  The control of crystal and particle size is proven by powder XRD, SEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements.  TGA and Ar sorption expts. show that the materials from modulated syntheses can be activated and that they exhibit high sp. surface areas.  Water proved to be essential for the formation of well-ordered Zr-bdc-NH2.

In this work, mol. simulations are used to provide guidelines for the design of MOFs for hydrogen storage.
