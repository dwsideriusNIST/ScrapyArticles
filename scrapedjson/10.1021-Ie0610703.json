ConclusionsSupporting Information Available1. Introduction The Maxwell\u2212Stefan (M\u2212S) equations1-3  are widely used in practice for modeling mixture diffusion in zeolites and carbon nanotubes. In eq 1, \u0110i is the Maxwell\u2212Stefan diffusivity of species i, qi is the molar loading, qi,sat is the saturation capacity of species i, and \u0110ij are the binary exchange coefficients. Equation 1 has been widely used for modeling and interpretation of zeolite membrane permeation experiments for a variety of molecules and mixtures.4-6 The major advantage of using the M\u2212S equations is that the diffusion coefficients \u0110i and \u0110ij can be estimated from pure-component adsorption and diffusion data.2,3 In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the use of zeolite membranes for separation of CO2 and CH4 mixtures,7-9 and in two recent publications, Zhu et al.9 and Li et al.8 have modeled permeation of CO2 (1)\u2212CH4 (2) mixtures across MFI and SAPO-34 (an isotype of CHA) membranes, respectively, making two debatable assumptions. First, in both papers the M\u2212S diffusivity \u0110i is assumed to be independent of the loading. Second, the binary exchange parameter \u011012 is estimated using the interpolation formula.  Both these assumptions have been questioned in a recent paper by Krishna et al.10 By reanalysis of unary permeation data of permeation of CO2 and CH4 across MFI, SAPO-34, and DDR membranes, Krishna et al.10 demonstrated that the M\u2212S diffusivity can be a strong function of the loading for a given guest molecule\u2212host zeolite combination. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a basis, Krishna et al.10,11 argued that, for zeolite structures that consist of cages separated by narrow windows, such as CHA, DDR, LTA, and ERI, intercage jumps are uncorrelated and, as an approximation, the binary exchange coefficient \u011012 can be taken to be infinite, i.e.,  However, the validity of eq 3 to describe mixture permeation in a cage-type zeolite membrane has not been tested against an experiment.  The present paper has the major objective of examining the extent to which eq 3 is successful for quantitative modeling of permeation of CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and N2/CH4 mixtures across a SAPO-34 membrane using only pure-component isotherms and permeation data as inputs. For this purpose, dedicated experiments in an improved membrane were performed with upstream pressures ranging to 7.2 MPa in order to ensure high occupancies in the membrane and thus allowing the M\u2212S equations to be tested more stringently. The membrane synthesis procedure used in the present study used a seeding procedure that resulted in a thinner membrane and higher fluxes than obtained in the previous study.8 The details of membrane synthesis, characterization, and measurement procedures along  with the experimental data have been given in Appendix A of the Supporting Information accompanying this publication.

Fitting of Pure-Component Isotherms The experimental pure-component isotherms for pure CO2, CH4, and N2 at 295 K are plotted in Figure 1. For adsorption in zeolite structures with cages separated by narrow windows, such as SAPO-34, the model based on statistical thermodynamics described by Ruthven (Chapter 3)12 is particularly relevant and useful.  In eq 4, qi represents the loading in mol kg-1, qi,sat is the saturation loading, and \u03a9i is maximum capacity in molecules per cage. As explained in Appendix B of the Supporting Information, there are distinct advantages to using eq 4 for fitting isotherms in cage structures such as CHA and DDR.

On the basis of the atomic composition of SAPO-34 used in our experiments, we calculate  It is important to have a good estimate of the saturation capacity, but it is not possible to obtain this information from experimental isotherm data because the pressures at which the pores get saturated can range to \u223c109 Pa and our experimental isotherms were only determined to a maximum pressure of 106 kPa. For CO2, for example, the molar volume of the liquid phase at 109 Pa is estimated to lie in the range of 30\u221235 cm3/mol from the data given by M\u00e4der and Berman.13 Golden and Sircar14 estimate the molar volumes for CO2, CH4, and N2 to be 33.3, 37.7, and 31.6 cm3/mol, respectively. For the measured pore volume of 0.26 cm3/g, the maximum capacity is estimated to be, after rounding off to integer values, 6 molecules/cage for CO2, CH4, and N2; see Table 1 that also lists the values of the fit parameter bi.

Analysis of Unary Permeation Data The unary permeation fluxes for CO2, CH4, and N2 at 295 K are plotted in Figure 2 as a function of the upstream pressure. If the M\u2212S diffusivity can be taken to be loading independent, we may write the permeation flux as  where DFi is the driving force  where fi,up and fi,down represent the pressures (more strictly, fugacities) of component i at the upstream (retentate) and downstream (permeate) sides of the membrane, respectively. The integral can be evaluated analytically to obtain  Plots of the unary permeation fluxes for CO2, CH4, and N2 against the driving force DFi are shown in Figure 3a. For both CH4 and N2, there are significant departures from linearity. For CO2, the dependence of the flux Ni on DFi is observed to be nearly linear for low values of the driving force, but at higher DFi, there appears to be significant departures from linearity.  For all three molecules, the assumption of a loading-independent \u0110i appears to be unjustified; this is more clearly evident when the values of the transport coefficients, \u03c1\u0110i/\u03b4 backed out using eq 6, are plotted against the component loading at the upstream face of the membrane, qi,up. The transport coefficients of CO2, CH4, and N2 depend on the upstream loading; see Figure 3b.  To quantify the loading dependence, we use the model developed by Reed and Ehrlich;10,15,16 this model gives the following expression,  where z is the coordination number, representing the maximum number of neighbors within a cage; we take z = 5, i.e., one less than the maximum capacity of molecules that can be accommodated in each cage. The other parameters are definedas (see ref 10 for more detailed discussions and derivations)   With the Reed\u2212Ehrlich loading dependence, we may define a modified driving force MDFi  The integration must be carried out numerically. The modified driving force must be expected to bear a linear relation with the permeation flux  The plots for CO2, CH4, and N2 are shown in Figure 4 parts a, b, and c, respectively. The Reed\u2212Ehrlich parameter \u03c6i was chosen to yield a straight-line relationship; the best-fit values that yield linear dependencies of Ni on MDFi are \u03c6i = 2.1, 3.0, and 2.3 for CO2, CH4, and N2, respectively.

The continuous solid lines represent the calculations by numerical solution of eq 3 across the membrane.    Figure 5 presents illustrations showing approximate molecular dimensions of CO2, CH4, and N2; these dimensions were estimated using published force fields for molecule\u2212molecule interactions.11,17,18 The values of the zero-loading transport coefficients \u03c1\u0110i(0)/\u03b4 appear to decrease sharply as the molecular diameter approaches the window size, which has a value of 3.8 \u00c5 for SAPO-34; see Figure 6a. The \u03c1\u0110i(0)/\u03b4 value for CO2 is lower than that of N2, perhaps because CO2 is a longer molecule. The loading dependence, characterized by the parameter \u03c6i, is stronger when the molecular diameter is larger; see Figure 6b. For an interpretation of the loading dependence of the M\u2212S diffusivity in terms of the free energy barrier for hopping of molecules between cages, see the papers of Beerdsen et al.19,20   Figure 8 Permeation fluxes for CO2 and CH4 for mixture campaign in which the total upstream pressure was maintained constant at 3.53 MPa and the partial pressures of both components were varied.

Modeling of Binary Mixture Permeation The experimental fluxes for binary (a) CO2/CH4, (b) CO2/N2, and (c) N2/CH4 mixtures are shown in Figures 7 parts a, b, and c (filled solid symbols), respectively, as a function of the total upstream pressure, fup. The feed gas composition for the CO2/CH4 and N2/CH4 mixtures was precisely equimolar. For the CO2/N2 mixtures, the feed gas composition was in the proportion 52.7% and 47.3%. The set of two differential  equations (eq 3) across the membrane was integrated across the membrane to obtain the steady-state fluxes using the numerical procedure described in earlier work.6,21 The mixture thermodynamics was estimated using the ideal adsorbed solution theory of Myers and Prausnitz.22 The model calculations are indicated by continuous solid lines in Figure 7. For all three binary mixtures, the fluxes are predicted with good accuracy using only pure-component diffusivity and isotherm data.  Figure 8 shows the experimental permeation fluxes for a CO2/CH4 mixture campaign in which the total upstream pressure was maintained constant at 3.53 MPa and the proportions of the two species was varied. Also in this case, the M\u2212S model (eq 3) yields results in good agreement with the experiment.  Figure 9 shows the experimentally determined permeation selectivity \u03b1perm defined by  for (a) CO2/CH4, (b) CO2/N2, and (c) N2/CH4 mixtures. In all three cases, the measured \u03b1perm decreases with increasing values of the upstream total pressure fup = f1,up + f2,up. The reason for this is to be found in the loading dependence of the transport coefficients; cf. Figure 3b. For both CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures, the transport coefficient of CO2 increases less sharply with loading than that of CH4 and N2; this causes the selectivity \u03b1perm to decrease with increasing loading on the upstream face. For the N2/CH4 mixture, the reduction in \u03b1perm with increasing fup is caused by the fact that the diffusivity of CH4 increases more sharply with loading than that of N2.  For all three mixtures, integration of eq 3 provides a very good estimate of the measured \u03b1perm; see the calculations indicated by the continuous solid lines. Inclusion of the binary exchange coefficient \u011012, estimated using eq 2, in the M\u2212S eq 1, will have the effect of slowing down the \u201cfaster\u201d molecules while concomitantly speeding-up the \u201ctardier\u201d molecules. These predictions are shown by the dashed lines in Figure 9 parts a, b, and c; for all three mixtures, this leads to a significantly poorer match with the experiments. For CO2/CH4 and N2/CH4 mixtures, allowance of a finite binary exchange coefficient \u011012 predicts a significantly lower \u03b1perm than in the experiments because of the slowing-down of the more mobile CO2, or N2, and concomitant speeding-up of the tardy CH4 in both these cases. For the CO2/N2 mixture, inclusion of \u011012 leads to a significantly higher value of \u03b1perm than that found experimentally; this is because of the slowing-down of the relatively more mobile N2 and the speeding-up of CO2.  The conclusion to be drawn from the results presented in Figures 7\u22129 is that intercage hopping of molecules within SAPO-34 occurs independent of each other and validates the use of the simplified M\u2212S eq 3. There is no perceptible slowing-down or speeding-up process. The window size of SAPO-34 is of the order of 3.8 \u00c5, and only one molecule can pass through the window at a time; this can also be visualized in the snapshots in Figure 10 obtained from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations of the CO2 and CH4 in SAPO-34. The intercage hopping of molecules between cages is uncorrelated, and the binary exchange coefficient \u011012 has a large value.   Figure 10 Snapshots showing the location of (a) CO2 and (b) CH4 molecules within the cages of SAPO-34 at 300 K and 1000 MPa.    For CO2/CH4 mixture permeation in DDR, the situation can be expected to be analogous to that of SAPO-34.10 This is confirmed by an analysis of the published experimental data of Tomita et al.7 for CO2/CH4 mixture permeation across a DDR membrane at 300 and 373 K; the information has been presented in Appendix C of the Supporting Information. Appendix C also confirms the ability of eq 3 to provide a reasonable prediction  of mixture diffusion at a various temperatures across the SAPO-34 membrane using the earlier set of experiments of Li et al.8   Top of PageAbstract1.

Conclusions The following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this paper.  (1) The M\u2212S diffusivities \u0110i of CO2, CH4, and N2 in SAPO-34 are all loading dependent. The larger the diameter of the molecule, the stronger is the loading dependence, characterized by the Reed and Ehrlich parameter \u03c6i.  (2) A unary permeation model incorporating the Reed\u2212Ehrlich description of the \u0110i\u2212qi dependence provides a good description of the experimental unary permeation data for CO2, CH4, and N2.  (3) Binary CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, N2/CH4 mixture permeation in SAPO-34 is best modeled by the M\u2212S eq 3, wherein the intercage hopping of molecules is taken to be independent of one another. This conclusion also holds for mixture permeation in other cage-type zeolites with narrow windows, such as DDR. Mixture permeation can be predicted very well using only pure-component transport and isotherm data.    Top of PageAbstract1. Introduction2. Fitting of Pure-Component Isotherms3.
