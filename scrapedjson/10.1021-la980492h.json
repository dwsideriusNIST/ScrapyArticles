It was reported elsewhere that 17 kJ/mol represents ", "Q", "st", " of water adsorption at zero surface coverage on the pure carbon surface without water\u2212surface group interactions.", "6,37,38", " The observed initial rise is due to the interactions of the water molecule with primary adsorption centers, surface groups. Since the carbons were outgassed at 393 K when only physically adsorbed water was removed (hydrogen bonded to the surface groups), the obtained heats of adsorption are smaller than the heat of water condensation (3-D hydrogen bonding). In small pores, during the process of occupying of the primary centers by water molecules, horizontal and vertical water\u2212water interactions gradually take place arising heats of adsorption to its limited value, 45 kJ/mol, which represents the heat of water condensation.", "36", " ", " ", "It is noteworthy that the water\u2212water interactions become predominant at the very low surface coverage. It follows that the energetics of the process become insensitive on the structural and chemical features of the carbon surface. For oxidized carbons the rise at the beginning is very steep due to the high density of acidic groups. This rise is less steep for the initial carbons where adsorption on oxygen groups gradually takes place reaching the limited value at the higher surface coverage. This can be ", " explained by the distribution of groups with relatively large distances between them which prevents the direct interactions of water\u2212water at a very low surface coverage. ", " ", "Another factor which is likely to play a role in determining the behavior of the heats of adsorption is the porosity of the carbon materials. The contribution of small pores should enhance the cluster formation even when total acidity is not very significant, as happened in the case of C-O carbon. Its density of groups is almost twice smaller than in the case of W-O; however, the energetics of the process are similar. ", " ", "It is interesting to compare the behavior of initial Westvaco and Calgon carbons. The densities of groups calculated from either Boehm or potentiometric titrations are similar; however, the isotherms differ significantly in the water uptake (Figure 9). The trends of the heats of adsorption are similar, but the W sample reaches the limiting value of the heat of water condensation at lower surface coverage than C. This is probably due to different strength and type of groups which are predominately acidic in the case of the Westvaco material. It was proposed that these groups mainly contribute in the water adsorption process.", "11", " The factors which make the shape of the isosteric heat of adsorption at very low surface coverage for the C sample slightly steeper then the one for the W sample are likely its microporosity and the significant volume of pores smaller than 5 \u00c5 (Table 1). ", " ", "The effect of the number and density of groups on the heats of adsorption can be considered when two groups of samples of different origins are discussed independently. This is due to the significant differences in their porosity. In the case of the Westvaco materials the limiting value of the heat of water condensation is reached at \u201cpseudosurface coverage\u201d 0.1 for W-O and 0.35 for W. As expected, this is in reciprocal relationship to the differences in the number and density of surface groups. When the carbon manufactured by Calgon is considered, the limiting value is reached at about 0.2 for C-O and 0.4 for C, which is also in agreement with the changes in their densities of surface groups (Table 4).

To the best knowledge of the authors the detailed thermodynamic studies of water interactions with the surface of oxidized activated carbon have been not yet been presented. The calculated heats of adsorption show the significant contribution of water\u2212water interactions even at very low relative pressure. Only at the very initial stage of the adsorption process can the analysis of the energetics give some information about water\u2212surface sites interactions. The differences observed for the carbons of particular origin are consistent with the treatment methods and changes in chemical and structural characteristics of the samples. It is difficult to find any direct link between four samples studied. This is due to significant differences in their pore structure which influence the water behavior and contribute to the energy of adsorption. Further studies on carbons having the pore structure not affected to a great extent are needed to evaluate the dependence of the isosteric heat of adsorption on surface chemistry.

In those cases, the adsorption equil. were practically established.  The heats of adsorption of n-alkanes on the Sarantype active carbon were twice as high compared with those on graphitized carbon black.  Adsorbates, mols. of which were capable of strong interaction, were eluted from the column with Saran-type active carbon in the form of asym. peaks.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaF1cXkslSjtrk%253D&md5=7107d7bdc91cfd22ae9460e040277395", " ", " "], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/1999/langd5.1999.15.issue-2/la980492h/production/images/small/la980492hf00012.gif\">"]}
