As discussed above, until now, the investigations of the molecular mobility of MOF materials are scarce in the literature.

Therefore, this relaxation region is also assigned to rotational fluctuations of phenyl rings. One may argue that the phenyl ring structure is completely symmetric and should carry therefore no dipole moment. However, in the MOF-5 structure, the phenyl rings might be a bit distorted, which will give a resultant dipole moment. This statement is supported by molecular dynamic and quantum mechanical simulations which show that the MOF structure is a rather soft material", "(49)", " which can be easily deformed and large transition dipole moments also exist.", "(39)", " Moreover, in the vicinity of the phenyl rings, carboxylate groups are present which carry a dipole moment.

Comparing all of these values with those of MOF-5, one has to note that the experimental estimates of the barriers of 1,4 phenylene dicarboxylates (terephthalates) vary widely.", "(24, 51)", " ", "As shown above, the dielectric relaxation region II consists of two processes which are similar with regard to their activation energies. Because this relaxation region was assigned to rotational fluctuations of the phenyl rings, it must be concluded that there are two different kinds of phenyl rings. In this moment, one can only speculate about the kinds of the different species. One interpretation starts from the fact that during synthesis solvent molecules are entrapped in the pores while during the thermal treatment we tried to remove the solvent as much as possible but also keep the structure of MOF-5 intact at the same time. This means that although most of the solvent was removed there might be a slight possibility that some solvent molecules are still entrapped in the cages of the MOF-5 structure. Considering the high dipole moment of diethylformamide and the low intensity of the observed relaxation process, the number of the remaining solvent molecules is quite small. Assuming that some solvent molecules remain in the MOF structure one can argue that both of these relaxation processes are related to phenyl rings which either have in the vicinity and can interact with solvent molecules or do not have in the vicinity solvent molecules (perturbed/unperturbed rings). Because the solvent molecules will hinder the rotational fluctuations of the phenyl rings, the relaxation process with the higher activation energy (low frequency part of relaxation region II) is assigned to the phenyl rings, which interact with some solvent molecules.", " ", "A second interpretation possibility comes from the result that the MOF-5 material investigated here has closed pores and an interpenetrated network structure. Having this picture in mind, the low frequency process of the relaxation region II with the higher activation energy can be assigned to phenyl rings (perturbed rings), which belong to an interpenetrated structure with closed pores. These structural defects will hinder the fluctuation of the phenyl rings which gives rise to higher activation energy. The high frequency processes of the relaxation region II (lower activation energy) is related to phenyl rings in structural intact MOF-5 units (unperturbed rings). To decide between these interpretation possibilities will require on the one hand additional investigations which include also the synthesis of model compounds. On the other hand, a more detailed discussion based on the temperature dependence of the dielectric strengths of the processes of relaxation region II is given below.", " ", "Concerning the spectral shape of the processes of region II (see Figure ", "5", "), the high frequency part is quite narrow and corresponds nearly to a Debye-like process. The shape of the low frequency part is quite broad and points to a distribution of activation energies. This result can be discussed in agreement with the above assignments. The solvent molecules can be entrapped in different ways to the pores/cages, or a variety of interpenetrated structures with a number of defects may exist. Both effects give rise to different environments for the fluctuations of the phenyl rings. This will result in a broad distribution of activation energies and a broad relaxation peak (low frequency part). On the other hand, if the pores are solvent free and a well-defined structure is present, this yields to a narrow distribution of activation energies (high frequency part).", " ", "One may argue that one of the processes of the relaxation II should be related to the solvent molecules themselves and not to the MOF-5-structure. This interpretation can be ruled out considering the fact that the glass transition temperature of diethylformamide is about 135 K.", "(52)", " This means that the relaxation process of the pure solvent should be expected at much lower temperatures than considered here.", " ", "The Debye theory of dielectric relaxation generalized by Kirkwood and Fr\u00f6hlich", "(34e)", " predicts for the temperature dependence of the dielectric relaxation strength ", "(3)", " where \u03bc is the mean dipole moment of the process under consideration and ", "N", "/", "V", " is the number density of dipoles involved.

For the low frequency contribution (perturbed rings), \u0394\u03b5 decreases with increasing temperature, while for the high frequency contribution (unperturbed rings) the dielectric strength increases with increasing temperature. The sum of both contributions decreases slightly with increasing temperature. First, the low value found for the dielectric strengths can be explained by the very low mean dipole moment expected for the fluctuating phenylene ring and from the nonpolar structure of MOF-5 in general. Second, a continuous change of the dipole moment with temperature is quite unlikely. Therefore, assuming that the dipole moment is constant, the different tendencies in the temperature dependencies imply that the population of the unperturbed and perturbed rings changes in the opposite direction (see eq ", "3", "). Figure ", "7", " shows that with decreasing temperature the fraction of perturbed rings (low frequency process) increases while the amount of unperturbed rings (high frequency process) decreases. Since no clear role of the solvent appears in these experiments, one can speak only about the flexibility of the MOF-5 structure.

This means that although the absolute number of phenyl rings is constant the fraction of unperturbed phenyl rings relative to the perturbed ones depends on temperature.

The pyridyl groups are responsible for the catalytic activity of the oxo-bridged trinuclear metal complexes, in e.g., transesterification of 2,4-dinitrophenyl acetate (NPA) with ethanol, which produced Et acetate in 77% yield, only in the presence of POST-1.

The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centers, linked together with a variety of polyat. org. bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mech. stability.  Describing examples of different Zn-contg. structures, e.g. MOF-2, MOF-5 and IRMOF-8 verified synthesis methods will be given, as well as a totally novel electrochem. approach for transition metal based MOFs will be presented for the 1st time.  With sufficient amts. of sample now being available, the testing of metal-org. frameworks in fields of catalysis and gas processing is exemplified.  Report is given on the catalytic activation of alkynes (formation of methoxypropene from propyne, vinylester synthesis from acetylene).  Removal of impurities in natural gas (traces of tetrahydrothiophene in methane), pressure swing sepn. of rare gases (Kr and Xe) and storage of H (3.3% at 2.0 MPa/77 K on Cu-BTC-MOF) will underline the prospective future industrial use of metal-org. frameworks in gas processing.

Highly reproducible 1H T1 relaxation, high-resoln. 13C CPMAS, and variable temp. quadrupolar echo 2H NMR data were obtained from high quality samples that were sealed at reduced pressure (ca. 3 mTorr). 2H NMR line shape simulation revealed an activation barrier for rotation of 11.3 \u00b1 2.0 kcal/mol, which is lower than the 14-16 kcal/mol values reported in theor. studies of truncated models.

The focal point of this report is the pitfalls related to the MOF-5 phase identification based on powder XRD data.  A broad set of conditions and procedures have been reported for MOF-5 synthesis.  These variations have led to materials with substantially different adsorption properties (sp. surface areas in the range 700 to 3400 m2/g).  The relatively low wt. loss obsd. for some as synthesized samples upon solvent removal is also indicative of a low pore vol.  Regrettably, these materials have all been described as MOF-5 without any further comments.  Furthermore, the reported powder XRD patterns hint at structural differences: The variations in surface area are accompanied by peak splitting phenomena and rather pronounced changes in the relative peak intensities in the powder XRD patterns.  In this work, we use single-crystal XRD to investigate structural differences between low and high surface area MOF-5.  The low surface area MOF-5 sample had two different classes of crystals.  For the dominant phase, Zn(OH)2 species partly occupied the cavities.  The presence of Zn species makes the hosting cavity and possibly also adjacent cavities inaccessible and thus efficiently reduces the pore vol. of the material.  Furthermore, the minor phase consisted of doubly interpenetrated MOF-5 networks, which lowers the adsorption capacity.  The presence of Zn species and lattice interpenetration changes the symmetry from cubic to trigonal and explains the peak splitting obsd. in the powder XRD patterns.  Pore-filling effects from the Zn species (and partly the solvent mols.) are also responsible for the pronounced variations in powder XRD peak intensities.  This latter conclusion is particularly useful for predicting the adsorption properties of a MOF-5-type material from powder XRD.

These intermediates were then converted into Cu@MOF-5 and ZnO@MOF-5 by hydrogenolysis or photoassisted thermolysis at 200-220\u00b0 in the case of Cu and hydrolysis or dry oxidn. at 25\u00b0 followed by annealing 250\u00b0 in the case of ZnO. 17O labeling studies using H217O (30%) revealed that neither the bdc linkers nor the central oxide ion of the Zn4O unit exchange oxygen atoms/ions with the imbedded ZnO species.  The obtained material Cu@MOF-5 (11 wt.% Cu), exhibiting an equiv. Langmuir surface of 1100 m2/g-1, was further characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  The Cu nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed over the MOF-5 microcrystals, occupying only about 1% of the cavities.  Their size distribution appears to be polydisperse with a majority around 1 nm in size (by EXAFS) together with a minority of larger particles up to 3 nm (PXRD).

The Langmuir surface area of MOF-5-int detd. by N2 adsorption is 950-1100 m2/g, much lower than the non-penetrated MOF-5 (3000 m2/g).  However, it can store 1.54-1.82 wt.% by volumetric method hydrogen at 77 K and 1 atm, which is higher than the amt. stored by the non-penetrated MOF-5.  The MOF-5-int was also characterized by powder x-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric anal., nitrogen adsorption/desorption anal., SEM and x-ray single-crystal structure diffraction.  In addn., we found that grinding greatly increases the decompn. of the MOF-5-int material by H2O to a nonporous phase ZnBDC\u00b7xH2O within 2-5 min (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), even under low humidity (30%), which calls for careful handling of the MOF-5 material.  The effects of the water content, reaction time, reaction temp., molar ratio of Zn(NO3)2 to H2BDC, addn. of H2O2, rapid stirring and diln. on the synthesis of MOF-5-int were studied and the synthetic conditions were optimized.

The lower the intensity ratio, the more porous it is.  In this study, we showed that MOF-5-int can have a very low R1 value but also a low porosity.  The low sp. surface area is mainly due to its interpenetrated structure instead of the entrapped zinc species or the mesopores in the material, as previously proposed in the literature, and assocd. with the characteristic, very strong peak at 13.8\u00b0 in its powder x-ray diffraction pattern.  A high R2 value (the ratio of the intensity of the peak at 13.8\u00b0 to that at 6.8\u00b0) suggests an interpenetrated structure, esp. when the R1 value is low.  In addn., we found that although entrapped ZnO or solvent mols. can increase the R1 value, and a low R1 value implies no zinc species or solvent mols. entrapped in the MOF-5 framework, a high R1 value does not necessarily suggest the presence of entrapped mols.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlt1Gjt7k%253D&md5=d6e80096fe88ce5cdc3c1122bdc155a5", " ", "43.

In order of decreasing temp. they are the \u03b1-relaxation due to the glass transition, the \u03b2*-process assigned to the out of plane movements of the naphthalene rings or aggregates of it, and the \u03b2-relaxation due to local mol. motions of carbonyl groups.

The assocd. apparent activation energies are rather high and depend on the thermal treatment and also surprisingly on the method of measurement.  It is concluded that the \u03b2*-relaxation is probably due to cooperative mol. motions of the naphthalene groups which aggregate in the amorphous state and that these aggregates are prevented from forming when the degree of crystallinity changes due to the thermal treatment.
