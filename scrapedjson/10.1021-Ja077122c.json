The miniaturization of components used in the construction of working devices is being pursued currently by the large-downward (Top-down) fabrication.  This approach, however, which obliges solid-state physicists and electronic engineers to manipulate progressively smaller and smaller pieces of matter, has its intrinsic limitations.  An alternative approach is a small-upward (bottom-up) one, starting from the smallest compns. of matter that have distinct shapes and unique properties - namely mols.  In the context of this particular challenge, chemists have been extending the concept of a macroscopic machine to the mol. level.  A mol.-level machine can be defined as an assembly of a distinct no. of mol. components that are designed to perform machinelike movements (output) as a result of an appropriate external stimulation (input).  In common with their macroscopic counterparts, a mol. machine is characterized by (1) the kind of energy input supplied to make it work, (2) the nature of the movements of its component parts, (3) the way in which its operation can be monitored and controlled, (4) the ability to make it repeat its operation in a cyclic fashion, (5) the timescale needed to complete a full cycle of movements and (6) the purpose of its operation.  Undoubtedly, the best energy inputs to make mol. machines work are photons or electrons.  Indeed, with appropriately chosen photochem. and electrochem. driven reactions, it is possible to design and synthesize mol. machines that do work.  Moreover, the dramatic increase in our fundamental understanding of self-assembly and self-organizational processes in chem. synthesis has aided and abetted the construction of artificial mol. machines through the development of new methods of noncovalent synthesis and the emergence of supramol. assistance to covalent synthesis as a uniquely powerful synthetic tool.  The aim of this review is to present a unified view of the field of mol. machines by focusing on past achievements, present limitations, and future perspectives.  After analyzing a few important examples of natural mol. machines, the most significant developments in the field of artificial mol. machines are highlighted.  The systems reviewed include (1) chem. rotors, (2) photochem. and electrochem. induced mol. (conformational) rearrangements, and (3) chem., photochem., and electrochem. controllable (co-conformational) motions in interlocked mols. (catenanes and rotaxanes) as well as in coordination and supramol. complexes, including pseudorotaxanes.  Artificial mol. machines based on biomols. and interfacing artificial mol. machines with surfaces and solid supports are among some of the cutting-edge topics featured in this review.  The extension of the concept of a machine to the mol. level is of interest not only for the sake of basic research, but also for the growth of nanoscience and the subsequent development of nanotechnol.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXpslGgug%253D%253D&md5=a320e773ae60305a52d0f42784273046", " ", "(b) Kottas, G.
