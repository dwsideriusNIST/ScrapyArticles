This indicates that in the coal pulverization process, some larger pores are cracked into small ones which results in the decrease of the mean pore size and the pore size distribution becomes narrower.

Generally speaking, there is a same trend in all the figures that with the decrease of coal particle size, the contribution of smaller pores to the total pore volume increases, especially for NMG coals.

In these magnified figures, we notice that with decrease of the particle size, the volume of small pores increases obviously. And there appears a small peak at about 3.5 nm which indicate the pores around this scale increase more quickly. The comminuting of coal is a process of the breakage of old pores and formation of new ones.

But values of ", "D", "SAXS", " are significantly higher than those obtained on the basis of the adsorption method. This is due to the different physical background of the two methods. The discrepancies between the two techniques are explained as follows. First, SAXS probes the whole particle and sees all the pores in the matrix, whereas the adsorption can only reach open pores. Hence the surfaces measured according to SAXS method exhibit more irregular. Second, the nitrogen adsorption experiment probes essentially only the organic portion. In contrast, the SAXS is also sensitive to the electronic atmosphere of the inorganic molecules. Finally, there is a main reason that the length scales over which the result is calculated by both methods are different. In other words, the two methods to determine fractal dimensions may yield results for different scales of the surface texture.", "(47)", " Therefore, one can expect that the changes of the fractal dimensions according to these different methods to follow the same trend, but need not coincide.", "(48)", "If one puts the figures of N", "2", " gas adsorption isotherms (Figures ", "1", "\u2212", "3", "), pore size distribution (Figures", "4", "\u2212", "6", "), SAXS curves (Figures ", "12", "\u2212", "14", ") together and compares carefully, it is interesting to find that all these three kinds of figures about NMG coals (Figures ", "2", ", ", "5", ", and ", "13", ") are little different from the other two coals. From Figure.", "5", ", it is obvious that there is a bimodal distribution for NMG coals while the other two coals only have one hump. The presence of mesopores causes the second hump. From the SAXS curves in Figure.", "13", ", we can see there are pronounced shoulders for NMG coals. Mitropoulos et al.", "(52)", " interpreted the shoulders as evidence of the presence of mesopores. Therefore it is proposed that the special shapes of hysteresis loop for NMG coals (Figure.", "2", ") are also caused by the existence of more mesopores which can result in a broader pore size distribution.

Isotherms of N2 gas adsorption/desorption analyses indicate that coals have different adsorption characteristics at relative pressure of 0-0.5 and 0.5-1.  On this basis, two fractal dimensions D1 and D2 (at relative pressure of 0-0.5 and 0.5-1, resp.) were obtained using the fractal Frenkel-Halsey-Hill (FHH) method, in which both proposed fractal exponents, '(D - 3)/3' and '(D - 3)' were investigated.  The fractal exponent '(D - 3)' provides more realistic results than fractal dimensions calcd. from (D - 3)/3.  The two fractal dimensions, D1 and D2, have different correlations with CH4 adsorption capacity of coals.  The CH4 adsorption capacity does not vary with increasing fractal dimension D1 up to \u223c2.5, but thereafter increases with D1.  In contrast, the CH4 adsorption capacity varies neg. with D2 within the entire data range.  Further investigation indicates that D1 represents fractals from pore surface area generated by surface irregularity of coals, while D2 characterizes fractals related to pore structures that are controlled by the compn. (e.g., ash, moisture, carbon) and pore parameter (e.g., pore diam., micropores content) of coals.  Higher fractal dimension D1 correlates to more irregular surfaces that provide more space for CH4 adsorption.  Higher fractal dimension D2 represents higher heterogeneity of pore structure and higher liq./gas surface tension that reduce CH4 adsorption capacity.  Therefore, more irregular coal surface and more homogeneous pore structure indicate higher CH4 adsorption capacity of coals.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXhtlCltL3I&md5=c7d70512f050bf7325c004945c472b9e", "11.

Detn. of DS in the multilayer region (n > 2) produced a higher value than the one obtained from monolayer coverage.  This was because the smooth particles were in closer contact with each other; at higher coverage the gas mols. probed the surface of the aggregates instead of the single particles.  As there were fewer contact points between the corrugated particles compared to the smooth particles, this effect took place at higher coverage (pressure) causing deviation from the expected values.  This finding is supported by the fact that for corrugated particles, the value of DS started to deviate at higher n and increased to 2.58 when n > 10.  The use of modified FHH theory is thus limited by the no. of adsorbed layers on the particles.

As part of a broader collaborative project with Mineral Resources Tasmania on the petroleum prospectivity of the Bass Basin, this geochem. study has yielded strong evidence that Paleocene-Eocene coals have sourced the oil and gas in the Yolla, Pelican and Cormorant accumulations in the Bass Basin.  Potential oil-prone source rocks in the Bass Basin have Hydrogen Indexes (HIs) greater than 300 mg HC/g TOC.  The coals within the Early-Middle Eocene succession commonly have HIs up to 500 mg HC/g TOC, and are assocd. with disseminated org. matter in claystones that are more gas-prone with HIs generally less than 300 mg HC/g TOC.  Maturity of the coals is sufficient for oil and gas generation, with vitrinite reflectance (VR) up to 1.8% at the base of Pelican-5.  Igneous intrusions, mainly within Paleocene, Oligocene and Miocene sediments, produced locally elevated maturity levels with VR up to 5%.  The key events in the process of petroleum generation and migration from the effective coaly source rocks in the Bass Basin are: (1) the onset of oil generation at a VR of 0.65% (e.g. 2,450 m in Pelican-5); (2) the onset of oil expulsion (primary migration) at a VR of 0.75% (e.g. 2,700-3,200 m in the Bass Basin; 2,850 m in Pelican-5); (3) the main oil window between VR of 0.75 and 0.95% (e.g. 2,850-3,300 m in Pelican-5); and; (4) the main gas window at VR >1.2% (e.g. >3,650 m in Pelican-5).  Oils in the Bass Basin form a single oil population, although biodegrdn. of the Cormorant oil has resulted in its statistical placement in a sep. oil family from that of the Pelican and Yolla crudes.  Oil-to-source correlations show that the Paleocene-Early Eocene coals are effective source rocks in the Bass Basin, in contrast to previous work, which favored disseminated org. matter in claystone as the sole potential source kerogen.  This result represents the first demonstrated case of significant oil from coal in the Australian context.  Natural gases at White Ibis-1 and Yolla-2 are assocd. with the liq. hydrocarbons in their resp. fields, although the former gas is generated from a more mature source rock.  The application of the methodologies used in this study to other Australian sedimentary basins where com. oil is thought to be sourced from coaly kerogens (e.g. Bowen, Cooper and Gippsland basins) may further implicate coal as an effective source rock for oil.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXns1GktLY%253D&md5=bbde157a0c654eadf3993e917d58896e", "46.
