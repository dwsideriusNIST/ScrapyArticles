This whole observation emphasizes that in contrast to the adsorption study the dynamics of the framework in the case of small pore type MOF plays a crucial role in the diffusion of the confined molecules within their pores, and this cannot be omitted in the MD simulations.

This trend is consistent with the increase of the van der Waals volume estimated for each alkane (see Figure ", "8", ") and thus confirms that in this host system the degree of confinement strongly affects the molecule\u2019s capacity to diffuse.", "Figure 8.

Because the size of tetrahedral cages is smaller than those of the octahedral cages, the alkanes more easily interact with the walls of the tetrahedral cages so are more likely to be adsorbed in these cages at low loading, as described above.

In each calculation, the starting coordinates of all the molecules stored in one MD trajectory were employed to determine whether the guests are located inside or outside the tetrahedral cages using the center positions and diameters of all of these types of cages. The subsequent coordinates of all the molecules were used to follow whether they enter or leave these cages. If some molecules that were initially inside a tetrahedron were found to move out of these cages, the time intervals between their entrance and the current moment were then calculated. As shown in Figure ", "11", ", the profiles of residence time and ", "D", "s", " are both nonmonotonic curves, and a minimum of residence time is obtained when the ", "D", "s\u00a0", "curve reaches the maximum in a similar way to what was previously observed for methane. Therefore, the ", "D", "s", " of guest molecules in porous materials may be linked to the residence time values.

The generation of metal-org. framework (MOF) coordination polymers enables the tailoring of novel solids with regular porosity from the micro to nanopore scale.  Since the discovery of this new family of nanoporous materials and the concept of so called 'reticular design', nowadays several hundred different types of MOF are known.  The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centers, linked together with a variety of polyat. org. bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mech. stability.  Describing examples of different Zn-contg. structures, e.g. MOF-2, MOF-5 and IRMOF-8 verified synthesis methods will be given, as well as a totally novel electrochem. approach for transition metal based MOFs will be presented for the 1st time.  With sufficient amts. of sample now being available, the testing of metal-org. frameworks in fields of catalysis and gas processing is exemplified.  Report is given on the catalytic activation of alkynes (formation of methoxypropene from propyne, vinylester synthesis from acetylene).  Removal of impurities in natural gas (traces of tetrahydrothiophene in methane), pressure swing sepn. of rare gases (Kr and Xe) and storage of H (3.3% at 2.0 MPa/77 K on Cu-BTC-MOF) will underline the prospective future industrial use of metal-org. frameworks in gas processing.

These clusters are often formed in situ, whereas the linkers are generally pre-formed.  The geometry and connectivity of a linker dictate the structure of the resulting MOF.

Both expts. and simulations show strong inflection characteristics in the adsorption isotherms.  The primary cause of the inflection is due to the strong preference for adsorption within, and in the regions close to the mouths of tetrahedral pockets.  The isotherm inflection has a significant influence on the dependence of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity, D, on the fractional occupancy, Di.  Both IRM expts. and simulations show that the Di-\u03b8i behavior appears to be influenced by the loading dependence of the inverse thermodn. factor 1/\u0393i = dln\u03b8i/dlnpi.  For nC4 and iC4, the Di increase sharply by about one order of magnitude as the occupancy \u03b8i increases from 0 to about 0.2.  This increase is caused by the fact that the diffusion characteristics undergo a transition from being dominated by hops across narrow 4.6 \u00c5 windows at low loadings to hops across large 9 \u00c5 windows for loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell.  For loadings higher than 8 mols. per unit cell the Di-\u03b8i dependence of nC4 and iC4 is dictated by 1/\u0393i, characteristic of more open channel structures such as FAU zeolite.

Competitive adsorption between isomers is obsd., particularly at high pressures, at which a linear isomer shows a larger extent of adsorption due to configurational entropy.  An inflection is found in the isotherm as a consequence of sequential adsorption in multiple favorable sites.  Compared with the noncatenated counterparts, IRMOF-13 and PCN-6 have a greater loading at low pressures because of the constricted pores and stronger affinity with adsorbate.  However, the reverse is true at high pressures due to the smaller pore vol.  Catenated MOFs exhibit larger adsorption selectivity for alkane mixts. than the noncatenated counterparts.  Adsorption selectivity in the four MOFs is comparable to that in carbon nanotube and silicalite, though adsorption capacity is lower in the latter.  Diffusivity of alkane in MOFs decreases with the degree of branching because a slender isomer diffuses faster.  With the presence of constricted pores, diffusivity in catenated MOFs is smaller than that in noncatenated counterparts.  In IRMOF-14 and IRMOF-13 diffusivity decreases monotonically, while it initially increases and then decreases in PCN-6'.  The diffusion selectivity in catenated IRMOF-13 and PCN-6 is larger than that in noncatenated IRMOF-14 and PCN-6'.

Clustering of guest mols. is found to manifest at temps. below the crit. temp., Tc, of the guest species.  The degree of clustering is increased as the temp., T, is reduced increasingly below Tc.  For linear alkanes, Tc increases with chain length and, consequently, at a given T the degree of clustering increases with increasing chain length.  For C4, C5, and C6 alkane isomers, the linear isomer shows a higher degree of clustering than the corresponding branched isomers.  Mixt. adsorption characteristics are significantly influenced by clustering; specifically, the sepn. selectivity increasesd significantly with lowering T.  The authors also discuss the interesting possibility of sepg. alkane isomer mixts. by exploiting the differences in the degrees of clustering, induced by differences in Tc of constituent species.

However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "76.

In the study, the authors detd. and analyzed the adsorption enthalpy, Henry consts., and entropic factors.  Preferential adsorption of bulky mols. is obsd. with specific adsorbate and cage size effects, yielding very specific, preferential adsorption.  Remarkably high adsorption selectivity factors (up to 14) for cyclo- compared to n-alkanes were found.  The presence of addnl. groups (Me, nitro) on the linkers in the framework influences adsorption properties significantly, mainly by reducing the effective pore size.  Whereas increased selectivity is obsd. for UiO-66-Me, this effect decreases again upon addn. of a 2nd Me group, UiO-66-Me2.  The latter allows for tuning confinement factors inside the pores, thus adsorption properties of the metal-org. framework.  The selective adsorption results from the interaction in the smallest octahedral cage.  The extreme confinement in the tetrahedral cage allows for stereoselective sepn. of disubstituted cycloalkanes and cis/trans alkenes.  Monte Carlo simulations were performed for the unfunctionalized UiO-66 framework.  First, a comparative study between the force fields Dreiding and UFF was performed with n-alkanes to obtain accurate and reproducible values.  The simulations show adsorbate mol. size-adsorbent cage size effects similar to window/cage effects reported for zeolites (e.g., silicalite).  Second, adsorption properties were simulated for selected cases, including stereoisomers.  Careful anal. of the adsorbate's mol. positioning in the framework confirms the exptl. data.

The heat of adsorption is an important thermodn. quantity that can be measured both in expts. and mol. simulations, and therefore it is often used to study the quality of a force field for a certain guest-host (g-h) system.  In mol. simulations, the heat of adsorption in zeolites is often computed using either of the following methods: (1) using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which requires the partial deriv. of the pressure with respect to temp. at const. loading, (2) using the energy difference between the host with and without a single guest mol. present, and (3) from energy/particle fluctuations in the grand-canonical ensemble.  To calc. the heat of adsorption from expts. (besides direct calorimetry), only the 1st method is usually applicable.  Although the computation of the heat of adsorption is straightforward for all-SiO2 zeolites, severe difficulties arise when applying the conventional methods to systems with nonframework cations present.  The reason for this is that these nonframework cations have very strong Coulombic interactions with the zeolite.  The authors will present an alternative method based on biased interactions of guest mols. that suffers less from these difficulties.  This method requires only a single simulation of the host structure.  The authors will review some of the other important issues concerning the handling of these strong Coulombic interactions in simulating the adsorption of guest mols.

Finally, mol. dynamics simulations allowed one to emphasize that all n-alkanes follow a pathway along the direction of the tunnel, leading to a 1-dimensional type diffusion mechanism, the motions being mainly centered around the middle of the pores at low loading, whereas they are significantly shifted toward the pore wall when the alkane concn. increases.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXotFSgsr4%253D&md5=d223004c77bc6a5fb714ff16ae7398d4", "111.

In LTA, Di,self appears to increase with qi for all mols. except N2.  In FAU and in MFI the Di,self shows a sharp decrease with increasing qi.  To gain insights into the causes behind the loading dependences, mol. dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to det. the self-diffusivities of 7 gases (CH4, N2, Kr, C2H6, C3H8, Ar, and Ne) in 6 different all-silica zeolite structures (MFI, AFI, FAU, CHA, DDR, and LTA).  The simulation results show that the variation of Di,self with qi is detd. by a variety of factors that include mol. size and shape, and degree of confinement within the zeolite.  For 1D channels (AFI) and intersecting channel structures (MFI), the Di,self invariably decreases with increasing qi.  For zeolite structures that consist of cages sepd. by windows (FAU, CHA, DDR, LTA), the size of the windows is an important determinant.  When the windows are wide (FAU), the Di,self decreases with qi for all mols.  If the windows are narrow (CHA, DDR and LTA), the Di,self often exhibits a sharp increase with qi, reaches a max. and reduces to near-zero values at satn.  The sharpness with which Di,self increases with qi, is dictated by the degree of confinement at the window.  Weakly confined mols., such as Ne, do not exhibit an increase of Di,self with qi.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXhtV2gtbzJ&md5=b3dc7c5730ae41f260b04b0939fb30fc", "112.

Two example cage/window-type confinements are examd.: ethane in ERI- and CHA-type zeolites.  In ERI-type zeolites, each hop in the z direction is preceded by a hop in xy direction and diffusion is anisotropic.  The lattice for CHA-type zeolite is a rhombohedral Bravais lattice, and diffusion can be considered isotropic in practice.  The anisotropic behavior of ERI-type cages reverses with loading, i.e., at low loading the diffusion in the z direction is two times faster than in the xy direction, while for higher loadings this changes to a z diffusivity that is more than two times slower.  At low loading the diffusion is impeded by the eight-ring windows, i.e., the exits out of the cage to the next, but at higher loadings the barrier is formed by the center of the cages.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XptFSjtQ%253D%253D&md5=6e704c044b7c46f25ee8327399082daf", "115.
