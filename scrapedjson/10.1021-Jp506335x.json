The pore structure of composites favors the access of reactant molecules to active sites and accelerates mass transfer in channels. Furthermore, the incorporation of graphite oxide creates a more hydrophobic environment surrounding metallic sites, which prevents the coordination bonds from attacking by water molecules and presents better affinity of active sites to organic reactants. Hence, the hydrothermal stability of MOF as well as the catalytic performance with regard to both activity and reaction rate are greatly improved. For the composite incorporating 8.7 wt % of graphite oxide, the conversion of styrene oxide in the ring-opening reaction can reach 74.1% after reaction for only 20 min, which is much higher than pure HKUST-1 (10.7%).

The interlayer distance can be reflected by the position of the XRD diffraction peak.

With the increase of graphite oxide content, the intensity of diffraction peaks decreases gradually. This can be ascribed to the progressively decreased amount of HKUST-1 in the composites. It should be noted that the diffraction peak for graphite oxide disappears in the composites. The relatively low intensity of graphite oxide as compared with HKUST-1 should be responsible for this phenomenon. Also, the reason could be the exfoliation of graphite oxide in polar solvents during synthesis and subsequent dispersion of layers in resultant composites.", "(41)", "Figure 1.

This is expected since the HKUST-1 networks are made of 9 \u00c5 square channels. Although the shape of isotherms for composites is quite similar to that of HKUST-1, a small hysteresis loop at high relative pressures can be seen. This means that the incorporation of graphite oxide leads to the formation of some meso/macropores in the composites. Table ", "1", " presents the textual parameters of different samples calculated from isotherms. Almost all of the composites show higher surface areas and pore volumes except for MG-5, the one with the highest graphite oxide content. The enhanced surface area may be caused by the new pores created at the interface between HKUST-1 units and graphene layers, which can be attributed to the coordination of the oxygen-containing groups of graphite oxide with the metallic centers of HKUST-1.", "(44)", " With increasing content of graphite oxide in the composites, the surface areas and pore volumes first increase and then decrease.

With a further increase in the graphite oxide content, the porosity of composites declines. This can be explained by the distortion in structure when elevated amounts of graphite oxide present in the composites. Another possible reason is the number of groups on graphite oxide surpasses the accessible sites on MOF, which causes the agglomeration of distorted graphene layers from graphite oxide.", "Figure 3. Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms at 77 K of HKUST-1 and MOF/graphite oxide composites.", "Figure ", "4", "a,b presents the TG and DTG data of graphite oxide, HKUST-1, and HKUST-1/graphite oxide composites. In the case of graphite oxide, the initial weight loss centered at about 100 \u00b0C corresponds to the removal of physically adsorbed water. The decomposition of epoxy groups occurs at around 200 \u00b0C, and the broad hump between 250 and 400 \u00b0C is related to the decomposition of carboxyl groups and sulfonic groups.", "(45)", " For HKUST-1, the weight loss centered at around 100 \u00b0C can be attributed to the release of free water inside the pores, whereas the release of crystallization water takes place at about 300 \u00b0C.", "(42)", " The complete collapse of MOF structure can be observed at around 350 \u00b0C, which is accompanied by the release of CO", "2", " and formation of copper oxide. For the MOF/graphite oxide composites, some interesting TG and DTG curves can be observed. After incorporating 4.0 wt % of graphite oxide, the weak DTG peak at about 300 \u00b0C derived from the release of crystallization water degrades to a shoulder peak. Moreover, such a peak disappears with the further increase of graphite oxide content. This suggests that the presence of graphite oxide provides a hydrophobic environment for some copper centers in the composites.", "(34)", " It is interesting to notice that the peak related to the decomposition of the epoxy groups centered at about 200 \u00b0C in graphite oxide is absent in the composites. This can be associated with the involvement of these groups in linkages with the metallic sites in HKUST-1.", "Figure 4.

In the case of graphite oxide (Figure ", "5", "a), dense agglomerates of stacked graphene sheets can be observed. HKUST-1 exhibits an octahedra-like shape with a few irregularities (Figure ", "5", "b). However, the HKUST-1/graphite oxide composites show quite different images from both HKUST-1 and graphite oxide (Figure ", "5", "c,d). They are thin platelets stacked together, which may be related to the improved porosity of the composites. According to these results and previous investigations,", "(46)", " it is assumed that graphene layers are generated from the exfoliation of graphite oxide during synthesis and that the growth of MOF occurs between the graphene layers and their thin agglomerates. As a result, the layer-spacing structure is formed in the resultant MOF/graphite oxide composites.", "Figure 5. SEM images of (a) graphite oxide, (b) HKUST-1, and (c, d) MG-2. Scale bars represent 10 \u03bcm.", "Modulation of Hydrothermal Stability and Hydrophilicity", "Hydrothermal stability is an important issue for many industrial applications since water exists at temperatures ranging from ambient to several hundred degrees. To probe the hydrothermal stability, the samples were exposed to water vapor at 363 K for 12 h. The XRD patterns of samples after treatment were used to evaluate the hydrothermal stability. As presented in Figure ", "6", ", the main peak of HKUST-1 at 11.6\u00b0 almost disappeared after treatment; meanwhile, a new peak at 10.1\u00b0 emerged. This mirrors a significant loss of structure integrity, and collapse and/or transformation of structure takes place. Apparently, pure HKUST-1 is not stable under the hydrothermal conditions investigated. For the composite MG-1 with a graphite oxide content of 4.0 wt %, a small diffraction peak at 10.1\u00b0 also appeared after treatment. That means, the structure of MG-1 is only partially destroyed due to the incorporation of graphite oxide. It is worth noting that the composites MG-2, MG-3, and MG-4 after treatment exhibit quite similar XRD patterns to the composites before treatment, and no new diffraction peaks are observable. These results clearly show that the incorporation of a proper amount of graphite oxide (8.7\u201327.2 wt %) is highly efficient in the improvement of hydrothermal stability. Further increasing the graphite oxide content to 34.3 wt %, however, the hydrothermal stability declines and partial destruction of structure can be seen for MG-5.", "Figure 6. XRD patterns of HKUST-1 and MOF/graphite oxide composites after hydrothermal treatment.", "The improved hydrothermal stability may be attributed to the modulation of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of MOFs. The incorporation of graphite oxide creates a more hydrophobic environment surrounding some copper centers owing to the presence of carbonaceous component,", "(34)", " which prevents the coordination bonds from attack by water via blocking the adsorption of water molecules, and thus enhances the hydrothermal stability of the MOF/graphite oxide composites. It should be noted that MG-1 and MG-5 show partial structure collapse after hydrothermal treatment. The low content of graphite oxide can explain the structural damage of MG-1 since the amount of graphite oxide (4.0 wt %) is not sufficient to create a hydrophobic environment. As for MG-5, the possible reason for its partial collapse may be that the presence of a rather high amount of graphite oxide could result in much distortion of the structure as well as the agglomeration of distorted graphene layers, which makes the frameworks easily attacked by water molecules.", "(47)", "To further verify the modulation of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, the adsorption of a typical polar solvent (water) and a typical nonpolar one (benzene) on the MOF before and after graphite oxide incorporation was conducted. As shown in Figure ", "7", "a, the adsorption amount of water on pure HKUST-1 is 10.7 mmol g", "\u20131", ", which is 3.6 times higher than the adsorption amount of benzene (3.0 mmol g", "\u20131", ", Figure ", "7", "b). Interestingly, the adsorption amount of water decreases sharply to 1.2 mmol g", "\u20131", " on the HKUST-1/graphite oxide composite, whereas the adsorption amount of benzene increases to 5.5 mmol g", "\u20131", ". In other words, the composite prefers to adsorb the nonpolar solvent benzene rather than the polar solvent water, and the adsorption amount of benzene is 4.6 times higher than that of water. The incorporation of graphite oxide into MOF leads to a completely contrary adsorptive property. The adsorption data of water and benzene, in combination with the aforementioned results, demonstrates that the incorporation of graphite oxide creates a more hydrophobic environment and makes the structure more stable upon hydrothermal treatment.", "Figure 7. Water and benzene vapor adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of samples (a) HKUST-1 and (b) MG-2.", "Catalytic Performance of Resultant Composites", "The resultant composites were applied to catalyze the synthesis of 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol (MPE) from the ring opening of styrene oxide. MPE is a valuable organic solvent and an intermediate for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.", "(48)", " Traditionally, the ring opening of styrene oxide is catalyzed by homogeneous acids or bases, leading to the problem of waste production and the difficulty in separation. The substitution of conventional homogeneous catalysts with heterogeneous ones thus attracts increasing attention. Because of the coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites and large surface areas, MOFs are active as heterogeneous catalysts in a collection of reactions.", "(49-51)", " The obtained composites were used to catalyze the conversion of ring opening of styrene oxide and the results are shown in Figure ", "8", ". No styrene oxide was converted at all even at 160 min on graphite oxide owing to the absence of active sites. In the case of HKUST-1, the conversion of styrene oxide is 26.7%, indicating the existence of catalytically active sites. The incorporation of graphite oxide evidently changes the catalytic activity. With increasing content of graphite oxide, the conversion of styrene oxide first increases and then decreases. It is noticeable that under the catalysis of MG-2, the conversion of styrene oxide reaches 79.2%, which is much higher than that over the MOF before incorporation. For the composite MG-5 with a high graphite oxide content of 34.3%, the conversion at 160 min is somewhat lower as compared with pure HKUST-1.", "Figure 8. Conversion of the ring opening of styrene oxide catalyzed by HKUST-1, graphite oxide, and the MOF/graphite oxide composites.", "In addition to the difference in conversion of styrene oxide, the reaction rate is also quite different for the MOFs before and after graphite oxide incorporation. Under the catalysis of HKUST-1, the conversion of styrene oxide is 10.7% at 20 min, which accounts for 40% of the conversion at 160 min (26.7%). Nevertheless, the MOF/graphite oxide composite MG-2 can convert 74.1% of styrene oxide at 20 min, which is 94% of the conversion at 160 min (79.2%). In other words, when MOF/graphite oxide composites are employed as catalysts, most reactions take place at the initial stage (within 20 min). Nonetheless, the conversion of styrene oxide over HKUST-1 increases gradually with reaction time in the whole process. On the basis of these results, it is clear that the reaction rate is enhanced by the incorporation of graphite oxide.", "Two factors are considered to be responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance due to graphite oxide incorporation. The first factor is the favorable pore structure caused by the incorporation of graphite oxide. During synthesis, the exfoliation of graphite oxide occurs and leads to the formation of graphene layers. As demonstrated by the IR technique, a collection of oxygen-containing groups (such as carbonyl and sulfonic groups) exist in graphite oxide. The interaction between graphite oxide and HKUST-1 can be attributed to the coordination of the oxygen-containing groups of graphite oxide with the metallic centers of HKUST-1. The nucleation and growth of HKUST-1 thus proceed between the graphene layers or their thin agglomerates. The layer-spacing structure is thus formed in the obtained MOF/graphite oxide composites. In contrast to pure MOF, some new pores are produced at the interface between MOF units and graphene layers. As a result, the surface areas of composites with an appropriate amount of graphite oxide are greatly enhanced, and some meso/macropores are generated. The pore structure of composites makes the active sites highly accessible to the reactants and accelerates mass transfer of reactants/products. Hence, the catalytic performance can be improved with regard to both activity and reaction rate.", "The second factor is the modulation of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. The incorporation of graphite oxide creates a more hydrophobic environment surrounding some copper centers in MOF as demonstrated by various techniques above. In addition to augmenting  hydrothermal stability, the hydrophobic environment presents better affinity of active sites to organic reactant (styrene oxide). The access of reactant molecules to active sites is thus enhanced, which should also be responsible for the improvement of catalytic performance. On the basis of the discussion above, it is thus safe to say that the enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the improvement of porosity and the creation of a hydrophobic environment in MOFs caused by the incorporation of graphite oxide.", "Because reusability is an important factor influencing the practical applications of heterogeneous catalysts, the catalytic activity of recovered MOF/graphite oxide composite is evaluated. As depicted in Figure ", "9", ", the conversion of styrene oxide remains almost constant in the six consecutive cycles over MG-2. The recovered catalyst still shows good catalytic activity that is comparable to the fresh catalyst. The XRD patterns of recovered catalysts were also recorded and the intense diffraction lines indicate the good preservation of crystallinity (data not shown). This demonstrates the excellent reusability of the composites in the ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide.", "Figure 9. Reusability of the MOF/graphite oxide composite MG-2 as a heterogeneous catalyst for the ring opening of styrene oxide.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results and Discussion", "Conclusions", "References", "Conclusions", "Although MOFs are of great interest for various applications, the reports regarding their practical use are sporadic, at best, due to some shortcomings inherent in MOFs. To overcome the shortcomings, we demonstrate the successful modulation of MOFs properties by incorporation of graphite oxide in the present study. The obtained MOF/graphite oxide composites exhibit layer-spacing structure due to the growth of MOF between the graphene layers or their thin agglomerates, giving rise to enhanced porosity with high surface areas and some meso/macropores. This favors the access of reactant molecules to active sites and mass transfer in channels. Moreover, the incorporation of graphite oxide creates a more hydrophobic environment surrounding metallic sites, which shields the coordination bonds from attack by water molecules and presents better affinity of active sites to organic reactants. As a result, the hydrothermal stability of MOFs as well as the catalytic performance with regard to both activity and reaction rate are greatly improved. Furthermore, the MOF/graphite oxide composites show excellent reusability, and the catalytic activity can be well retained even after six cycles.

The applications and potentials of thin film coatings of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) supported on various substrates are discussed in this crit. review.  Because the demand for fabricating such porous coatings is rather obvious, in the past years several synthesis schemes were developed for the prepn. of thin porous MOF films.  Although this is an emerging field seeing a rapid development a no. of different applications on MOF films were either already demonstrated or are proposed.  This review focuses on the fabrication of continuous, thin porous films, either supported on solid substrates or as free-standing membranes.  The availability of such two-dimensional types of porous coatings opened the door for a no. of new perspectives for functionalizing surfaces.  Also for the porous materials themselves, the availability of a solid support to which the MOF-films are rigidly (in a mech. sense) anchored provides access to applications not available for the typical MOF powders with particle sizes of a few \u03bcm.  The authors will also address some of the potential and applications of thin films in different fields like luminescence, QCM-based sensors, optoelectronics, gas sepn. and catalysis.  A sep. chapter was devoted to the delamination of MOF thin films and discusses the potential to use them as free-standing membranes or as nanocontainers.  The review also demonstrates the possibility of using MOF thin films as model systems for detailed studies on MOF-related phenomena, e.g. adsorption and diffusion of small mols. into MOFs as well as the formation mechanism of MOFs (101 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXptFSrsw%253D%253D&md5=f0cfc5747b35e6a9477e04afd1d3381f", "13.

In contrast, the reactivity of the medium pore TS-1 for 1-hexene oxidn. was seen to be much higher in methanol (protic) than in acetonitrile (aprotic) solvent.  These differences have been related to the hydrophilic character of Ti-beta, in contrast to the hydrophobic character of TS-1.  The selectivities to the epoxide and to the ketone during 1-hexene and cyclohexanol oxidns., resp., on Ti-beta were also highest in acetonitrile.  This was assocd. to the poisoning of the Broensted acid sites assocd. with frame work aluminum by the basic acetonitrile mols., thus avoiding acid-catalyzed secondary reactions.  The different effects that solvents have on the catalytic properties of Ti-beta and TS-1 are of prime importance from the point of view of the application of these catalysts, since, as can be seen from this work, the optimum operating conditions would be quite different for both the Ti-beta and TS-1 materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28XksFGjtLo%253D&md5=690a697e980e45071d6f62df0659b745", "24.

The materials were characterized by SEM (SEM), nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy, and XPS, and their performances for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal were evaluated by dynamic testing at room temp.  The composites exhibit microporous structure with a small amt. of mesopores, and the structure is highly dependent on the amt. of GO loaded.  The surface area and pore vol. first increase and then decrease with increasing GO, reaching the max. value when the GO ratio is 5.25%.  The composites exhibit high adsorption capacities for H2S, with the max. uptakes reaching up to 130.1 mg/g.  Although the loading of GO makes a contribution to the enhancement of dispersive force in the porous structure, it leads to the crystal distortion of MOF-5.  The introduction of glucose can restrain this distortion to maintain the structure stability.  A good match between GO and glucose have a well synergy effect to develop the porous structure, resulting in the highest H2S adsorption capacity.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhtlSksbvI&md5=66358675ff45e55abc339fbaf8c6fea5", "48.

Epoxides are versatile building blocks for org. synthesis.

Terminal epoxides are available very inexpensively as racemic mixts., and kinetic resoln. is an attractive strategy for the prodn. of optically active epoxides, given an economical and operationally simple method.  Readily accessible synthetic catalysts (chiral cobalt-based salen complexes) have been used for the efficient asym. hydrolysis of terminal epoxides.
