Within these single-linker nets, it is important to observe that there is no single, dominant topology of MOF; various nets excel at various objectives. Accordingly, we can conclude that in order to achieve MOFs exhibiting a particular compromise between GSA and VSA, one can focus on a particular set of MOF topologies. One can also observe that nets comprising linkers of a particular shape (i.e., linear, trigonal, etc.) have significantly different performance; for instance, nets comprising linear linkers achieve the highest GSA but at the expense of VSA (see the ", "Supporting Information", ").", "For comparison, we have included (see Figure ", "1", ") calculated surface areas for HKUST-1 (", "tbo", " net),", "(39)", " MOF-5 (", "pcu", "),", "(17)", " MOF-210 (highest BET VSA; ", "toz", " net, a two-linker system not explored in this work),", "(27)", " and NU-110 (highest BET GSA; ", "ntt", " or ", "rht", " net)", "(1)", " computed using the procedure described above. We note that our geometry-based (i.e. monolayer) accessible surface areas calculated for the methane probe do not necessarily reflect the BET (i.e. nitrogen multilayer) surface areas calculated for these materials.

The Pareto front consists of those data points in a multiobjective space which are nondominated (i.e., for which no other data points exhibit superior values in all objective functions). This concept is commonly used in chemical informatics, for instance, in the multiobjective design of libraries of small druglike molecules.", "(41)", " In the context of this work, a data point (MOF structure) is on the Pareto front if no other point exhibits both superior GSA and superior VSA.", "The Pareto front is illustrated in Figure ", "2", ".

Performance of nets on the Pareto front for set I linkers. The Pareto front is shown as a thick gray line. Large symbols reflect the single optimal structure models from Figure ", "1", ", and small symbols reflect other Pareto-optimal solutions for each net. The dashed lines reflect the overall range of GSA and VSA explored for each net and also for all single-linker nets (gray).", "We thereby conclude that, depending on the specific combination of GSA and VSA desired for an application, one can focus on these specific topologies to engineer MOFs with optimal pore geometry. For instance, the highest GSA is achieved with the ", "cds", " net, due to its cubic latticelike topology, enabling very high GSA designs arising from lengthening the organic linkers; however, this can be seen to come at the expense of VSA, since long linkers result in large pores which do not contribute to the surface area (similarly for the ", "pcu", " net). By contrast, the highest VSA and GVSA are achieved with the ", "pyr", " net; this is due to the specific arrangement of trigonal linkers in the ", "pyr", " net, which are oriented such that branches extending from linkers\u2019 central ring sections do not extend toward one another (see the ", "Supporting Information", "), permitting extensive branching within a small volume, and thereby favoring VSA, at the potential expense of GSA. Finally, we predict that MOFs exhibiting the ", "tbo", " net (and for more synthetically challenging linkers, the ", "pts", " net) are able to occupy a space between these two extremes, enabling an alternative compromise between GSA and VSA.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.

The discovery of this inversion between expected and obsd. nets led the authors to deduce a system of classification taxonomy for interpreting and rationalizing known MOF structures, as well as those that will be made in future.  The origin of this inversion is attributed to the different modes with which MOF synthesis was approached.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.  Hence, one of the important challenges going forward is to find ways to pack MOFs efficiently without serious damage or to synthesize MOFs that can withstand substantial mech. pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtV2msbrN&md5=23f9bfad78f204569f0bf7c902d42dca", "24.

A strength of this approach is that the space of ligands to be explored can be rigorously bounded, allowing discovery of the optimum ligand shape within any criteria, conforming to synthetic requirements or arbitrary exploratory limits.  By modifying these bounds, one can project to what extent achievable surface area increases when moving beyond the present limits of org. synthesis.  Projecting optimal ligand shapes onto real chem. species, the authors achieve blueprints for MOFs of various topologies that are predicted to achieve up to 70% higher surface area than the current benchmark materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXjtlymsbw%253D&md5=31d7c08ea076c11cca6b08f02d1b3dd3", "29.

In this contribution we describe an automated technique for MOF design based on math. optimization.  Optimization is performed on linkers represented by abstr. space-filling shapes, in order to generalize the desirable geometric parameters describing linkers, and optimal shapes are projected to real mols. to illustrate realistic MOFs exhibiting the calcd. properties.  Six examd. topologies of MOF and two distinct geometrical pore properties relevant to guest adsorption phenomena are explored.

Tetrahedral SBUs in Zn(ADC)2\u00b7(HTEA)2 (MOF-31; H2ADC = acetylenedicarboxylic acid; HTEA = monoprotonated triethylamine), Cd(ATC)\u00b7[Cd(H2O)6](H2O)5 (MOF-32; H4ATC = adamantanetetracarboxylic acid), and Zn2(ATB)(H2O)\u00b7(H2O)3(DMF)3 (MOF-33; H4ATB = adamantanetetrabenzoic acid) are linked into diamond networks, while those of Ni2(ATC)(H2O)4\u00b7(H2O)4 (MOF-34) have the structure of the Al network in SrAl2.  Frameworks constructed from less sym. tetrahedral SBUs have the Ga network of CaGa2O4 as illustrated by Zn2(ATC)\u00b7(EtOH)2(H2O)2 (MOF-35) structure.  Squares and tetrahedral SBUs in Zn2(MTB)(H2O)2\u00b7(DMF)6(H2O)5 (MOF-36; H4MTB = methanetetrabenzoic acid) are linked into the PtS network, which is the simplest structure type known for the assembly of these shapes.  The octahedral SBUs found in Zn2(NDC)3\u00b7[(HTEA)(DEF)(ClBz)]2 (MOF-37; H2NDC = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid) form the most common structure for linking octahedral shapes, namely, the B network in CaB6.  New structure types for linking triangular and trigonal prismatic SBUs are found in Zn3O(BTC)2\u00b7(HTEA)2 (MOF-38; H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) and Zn3O(HBTB)2(H2O)\u00b7(DMF)0.5(H2O)3 (MOF-39; H3BTB = 1,3,5-benzenetribenzoic acid).
