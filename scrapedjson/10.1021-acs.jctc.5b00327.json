In the present report, soft-X-ray XANES spectra of Li K-edge, P L2,3-edge, O K-edge and Fe L2,3-edge have been obtained for LiFePO4 in cryst., disordered and amorphous forms and some possible \"impurities\", including LiPO3, Li4P2O7, Li3PO4, Fe3(PO4)2, FePO4, and Fe2O3.  The results indicate that each element from different pure ref. compds. exhibits unique spectral features in terms of energy position, shape and intensity of the resonances in its XANES.  In addn., inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) reveals the surface vs. bulk property of the specimens.

Over the last three decades low-dimensional systems have attracted increasing interest both from the fundamental and technol. points of view due to their unique phys. and chem. properties.  X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful tool for the characterization of such kinds of systems, owing to its chem. selectivity and high sensitivity in interat. distance detn.  Moreover, XAS does not require long-range ordering, that is usually absent in low-dimensional systems.  Finally, this technique can simultaneously provide information on electronic and local structural properties of the nanomaterials, significantly contributing to clarify the relation between their at. structure and their peculiar phys. properties.  This review provides a general introduction to XAS, discussing the basic theory of the technique, the most used detection modes, the related exptl. setups and some complementary relevant characterization techniques (diffraction anomalous fine structure, extended energy-loss fine structure, pair distribution function, x-ray emission spectroscopy, high-energy resoln. fluorescence detected XAS and x-ray Raman scattering).  Subsequently, a selection of significant applications of XAS to two-, one- and zero-dimensional systems will be presented.  The selected low-dimensional systems include IV and III-V semiconductor films, quantum wells, quantum wires and quantum dots; carbon-based nanomaterials (epitaxial graphene and carbon nanotubes); metal oxide films, nanowires, nanorods and nanocrystals; metal nanoparticles.

In contrast, some MOFs may have interesting photochem. properties that derive from the fundamental event of charge sepn. in electrons and holes upon light absorption.  Photoinduced charge sepn. is the hallmark of a semiconductor that can behave simultaneously as an oxidizing or reducing agent.  Considering the novelty of this field, most of the available data about MOFs as semiconductor have been obtained from MOF-5, a case that is complicated due to its low structural stability.

The authors investigate how the initially excited metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) singlet state deactivates to the final metastable high-spin state.  Although ultrafast x-ray free-electron spectroscopy has established that the total timescale of this process is on the order of a few tenths of a picosecond, the details of the mechanisms still remain unclear.  The authors det. all the intermediate electronic states along the pathway from low spin to high spin and give ests. for the deactivation times of the different stages.  The calcns. result in a total deactivation time on the same order of magnitude as the exptl. detd. rate and indicate that the complex can reach the final high-spin state by means of different deactivation channels.  The optically populated excited singlet state rapidly decays to a triplet state with an Fe d6(t52ge1g) configuration either directly or by means of a triplet MLCT state.  This triplet ligand-field state could in principle decay directly to the final quintet state, but a much faster channel is provided by internal conversion to a lower-lying triplet state and subsequent intersystem crossing to the high-spin state.  The deactivation rate to the low-spin ground state is much smaller, which is in line with the large quantum yield reported for the process.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhslCrtbzJ&md5=f2e39f4b4208a2e3aa94efb3eee81b00", "32.

Calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) validate the structural assumption insofar as the low-spin-state optimised geometries are found to be in very good agreement with the experimental X-ray structure of the complex and the predicted high-spin geometries are all very close to one another for a whole series of common GGA (PB86, PW91, PBE, RPBE) and hybrid (B3LYP, B3LYP*, PBE1PBE) functionals.  This confirmation of the structural assumption underlying the estimation of Delta(E)0HL from experimental relaxation rate constants permits us to use this value to assess the ability of the density functionals for the calculation of the energy difference between the HS and LS states.  Since the different functionals give values from -1000 to 12000 cm(-1), the comparison of the calculated values with the experimental estimate thus provides a stringent criterion for the performance of a given functional.

Re(CO)3{OMg}3 (where the braces denote groups terminating the bulk of the support).  These were made, e.g., from [HRe(CO)5] and from [H3Re3(CO)12]; the Re-Osurface distance detd. by EXAFS spectroscopy is 2.15 \u00b1 0.03 \u00c5; the support is a tridentate ligand.

Supported complexes made from [HRe(CO)5] catalyze alkene hydrogenation but not cyclopropane hydrogenolysis, whereas catalysts made from [H3Re3(CO)12] catalyze both these reactions, and EXAFS data indicate neighboring Re centers on the latter (but not the former), which are implicated in the catalysis.  EXAFS data similarly indicate supported Mo and W pair sites as catalysts.  Supported metal clusters made by decarbonylation of metal carbonyl clusters, e.g., Ir4/\u03b3-Al2O3 and Ir6/\u03b3-Al2O3 or Rh6/zeolite NaY, are indicated by EXAFS data to be tetrahedra and octahedra, resp.  Such clusters are the species detected by EXAFS spectroscopy at 298 K in the presence of propene and H2 undergoing catalytic hydrogenation, and they are identified as the catalytically active species.  The catalytic activities of the clusters for toluene hydrogenation and alkene hydrogenation are almost unaffected by changes in metal oxide support compn., but they depend on the cluster size, although the catalytic reaction is structure insensitive.

In spite of the many efforts aimed at assessing the performances of d. functional theory for such systems, an exchange-correlation functional able to account accurately for the energetic of the various possible spin-states has not been identified yet.  Here, we critically discuss the issues related to the theor. description of this class of mols. from first principles.  In particular, we present a comparison between different d. functionals for four ions, namely, Fe(H2O)62+, Fe(NH3)62+, Fe(NCH)62+, and Fe(CO)62+.  These are characterized by different ligand-field splittings and ground state spin multiplicities.  Since no exptl. data are available for the gas phase, the d. functional theory results are benchmarked against those obtained with diffusion Monte Carlo, one of the most accurate methods available to compute ground state total energies of quantum systems.  On the one hand, we show that most of the functionals considered provide a good description of the geometry and of the shape of the potential energy surfaces.  On the other hand, the same functionals fail badly in predicting the energy differences between the various spin states.  In the case of Fe(H2O)62+, Fe(NH3)62+, Fe(NCH)62+, this failure is related to the drastic underestimation of the exchange energy.  Therefore, quite accurate results can be achieved with hybrid functionals including about 50% of Hartree-Fock exchange.  In contrast, in the case of Fe(CO)62+, the failure is likely to be caused by the multiconfigurational character of the ground state wave-function and no suitable exchange and correlation functional has been identified.

A well defined first coordination shell composed on av. of 4.5 I- ions around the imidazolium cation has been evidenced, and the structural arrangement of the I- ions has been found to be different in the proximity of the most acidic hydrogen atom of the imidazolium ring, as compared to the other two ring protons: in the former case the I- ion is not coplanar with the imidazolium ring plane, but it prefers to be above and below the plane itself, while in the latter the anion has the same probability of being or not being coplanar with the plane.  A quant. anal. of the I K-edge EXAFS spectrum of liq. [C4mim]I has been carried out starting from the structural information on the system derived from the MD simulation.  This combined approach allows one to reduce the no. of correlated model parameters required in the fitting of the exptl. data and to increase the reliability of the EXAFS data anal. that represents a non-trivial task when dealing with disordered systems.
