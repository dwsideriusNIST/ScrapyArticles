The nature of the interpenetration is controlled by the auxiliary ligands bound in the equatorial plane of the metal center.  Ethylene glycol (eg) binds in a unidentate fashion to form phase A which has 28% accessible solvent vol. and contains four interpenetrating (10,3)-a networks.  1,2-Propanediol (1,2-pd) coordinates as a bidentate ligand to yield a phase B with a greatly enhanced 51% of solvent accessible vol., because only two (distorted) (10,3)-a' networks interpenetrate.  Ligands in the void space and bound to the metal center can both be liberated thermally: the kinetics of this process gave microporous desolvated cryst. A and B.  The porous phases lose crystallinity reversibly upon further loss of ligands bound to the equatorial metal: crystallinity is restored upon exposure to the vapors of simple alcs., which can also effect conversion of B to A.  Both phases present interpenetrating network topologies that are unique to chem. and adopt space groups that are new for mol. solids: A crystallizes in P4232 and B adopts I4132.  B can be grown homochirally from enantiomerically pure diol template.  The stereochem. of the alc. bound to the metal controls the helicity of the chiral framework.

Compd. 1 exhibits a 3-fold interpenetrated diamondoid array typically based on a tetrahedral 2nd building unit (SBU) at a single Zn center.  Compd. 2 adopts a 3-fold interpenetrated \u03b1-Po-type network that is built from bimetallic cores as six-connected vertexes.  The structure of 3 also consists of dinuclear units comprising a novel (3,4)-connected 3-fold interpenetrated net with complex (4.6 \u00d7 10)-(4.62 \u00d7 103) topol. when single Zn centers act as four-connected nodes (or the \u03b1-Po topol. if dinuclear units are considered as six-connected nodes).  4, Derived from a cross-linked 5-fold interpenetrated diamond-like substructure, is an unusual example of a self-penetrating coordination framework displaying an unprecedented eight-connected 42068 topol. with trinuclear Cd clusters as eight-connected nodes which, to the authors' knowledge, not only defines a new topol. for eight-connected coordination networks, but also represents the highest connected topol. presently known for self-penetrating systems.  Detailed structural comparison of these complexes indicates that the increase in metal nuclearity induces the progressive increase in the connectivities of the ultimate nets: i.e., the metal nuclearity plays a significant role in tuning the connectivity of a specific network.
