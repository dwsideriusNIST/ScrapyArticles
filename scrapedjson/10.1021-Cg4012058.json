In fact, these MOFs are polymorphs, or framework isomers: they are assembled from the same metal secondary building units and organic linkers, but the connectivity of these components differs. Here we report for the first time the synthesis of the vanadium MOF MIL-88B(V) and compare its synthesis parameters to those of MIL-47(V) and the recently reported MIL-101(V). The properties of MIL-88B(V) and MIL-101(V) are remarkably different. MIL-88B(V) can \u201cbreathe\u201d and is responsive to different solvents, while MIL-101(V) is rigid and contains mesoporous cages. MIL-101(V) exhibits the highest specific surface area among vanadium MOFs discovered so far. In addition, both MIL-88B(V) and MIL-101(V) transform to MIL-47 at higher temperatures. We have also identified the key synthesis parameters that control the formation of MIL-88B(V), MIL-101(V), and MIL-47: temperature, time, and pH.

However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "18.

Higher V contents in the catalyst leads to the formation of polymeric V2O5-like species.  Both XRD and textural results indicate that the mesoporous structure of the support is mostly maintained after the V incorporation, and therefore high surface areas are obtained on the final catalysts.

Exptl., a sudden increase in Ds for H2 at low loading (\u22641 H2/unit cell) was obsd. with values at least two orders of magnitude higher than in zeolites.  This unusual behavior has been denoted as \"super-mobility\".  Here, two different force fields available in the literature to represent the H2/H2 and H2/MOF framework interactions have been considered to capture such exptl. findings via mol. dynamics simulations.  We have shown that (i) a similar magnitude of the energetic contribution for the H2/H2 and H2/MOF framework interactions and (ii) a smoothness of the potential energy surfaces are required in order to match the supermobility of H2 at low loading.  The diffusion mechanism at the microscopic scale was successfully simulated in both materials and described in terms of the chem. features of the MIL framework, i.e., the presence or absence of the \u03bc2 hydroxyl group.  It appears that a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along the z axis and purely random three-dimensional (3D) diffusion processes are obsd. for MIL-53(Cr) and MIL-47(V), resp.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.

For CO2 adsorption on desolvated solids, remarkable behavior is shown by the flexible MIL-53(Sc), which opens in two stages to a max. capacity of >13 mmol g-1, while the rigid frameworks show uptakes at 196 K (at p/po = 0.40) of 5.5 mmol g-1 (Sc2BDC3), 21.3 mmol g-1 (MIL-100(Sc)) and 13.1 mmol g-1 (Sc-ABTC).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXjtFOntrk%253D&md5=0cb5c1373d4095e3e1b52696baa64170", "59.

Finally, a computationally assisted structure detn. led to a proposal of plausible structures for the closed (dried) and open forms of modified MIL-88B and MIL-88D and to evaluation of their framework energies subject to the nature of the functional groups.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhtlSqsb7L&md5=10d3c68c2476fa1ed4072951da4b276d", "74.

By carefully controlling the reaction conditions, the microwave method provided superior quality MIL-88B crystals in high yields and excellent phase purity.  Framework flexibility was obsd. for both MIL-88B-Fe and NH2-MIL-88B-Fe frameworks in various solvents, which however significantly differs between the two materials.  MIL-88B-Fe shrinks reversibly by \u223c25% only when it is dispersed in the strongly H bonding solvents H2O or MeOH.  In contrast, NH2-MIL-88B-Fe shrinks up to 33% upon replacement of DMF by any other solvent studied (benzene, CHCl3, acetone, MeCN, MeOH, H2O).  The change in unit cell parameters (shortening of the a axis) can be seen macroscopically, although the overall integrity of the materials is maintained.  Probably H bonding between the O atoms of the MIL-88B-Fe framework and solvent mols. plays an important role in the framework shrinkage, while in the NH2-MIL-88B-Fe framework addnl.
