Noble metal nanostructures attract much interest because of their unique properties, including large optical field enhancements resulting in the strong scattering and absorption of light.  The enhancement in the optical and photothermal properties of noble metal nanoparticles arises from resonant oscillation of their free electrons in the presence of light, also known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).  The plasmon resonance can either radiate light (Mie scattering), a process that finds great utility in optical and imaging fields, or be rapidly converted to heat (absorption); the latter mechanism of dissipation has opened up applications in several new areas.  The ability to integrate metal nanoparticles into biol. systems has had greatest impact in biol. and biomedicine.  In this Account, the authors discuss the plasmonic properties of gold and silver nanostructures and present examples of how they are being utilized for biodiagnostics, biophys. studies, and medical therapy.  For instance, taking advantage of the strong LSPR scattering of gold nanoparticles conjugated with specific targeting mols. allows the mol.-specific imaging and diagnosis of diseases such as cancer.  The authors emphasize in particular how the unique tunability of the plasmon resonance properties of metal nanoparticles through variation of their size, shape, compn., and medium allows chemists to design nanostructures geared for specific bio-applications.  The authors discuss some interesting nanostructure geometries, including nanorods, nanoshells, and nanoparticle pairs, that exhibit dramatically enhanced and tunable plasmon resonances, making them highly suitable for bio-applications.  Tuning the nanostructure shape (e.g., nanoprisms, nanorods, or nanoshells) is another means of enhancing the sensitivity of the LSPR to the nanoparticle environment and, thereby, designing effective biosensing agents.  Metal nanoparticle pairs or assemblies display distance-dependent plasmon resonances as a result of field coupling.  A universal scaling model, relating the plasmon resonance frequency to the interparticle distance in terms of the particle size, becomes potentially useful for measuring nanoscale distances (and their changes) in biol. systems.  The strong plasmon absorption and photothermal conversion of gold nanoparticles has been exploited in cancer therapy through the selective localized photothermal heating of cancer cells.  For nanorods or nanoshells, the LSPR can be tuned to the near-IR region, making it possible to perform in vivo imaging and therapy.  The examples of the applications of noble metal nanostructures provided herein can be readily generalized to other areas of biol. and medicine because plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit great range, versatility, and systematic tunability of their optical attributes.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXltlWgtrY%253D&md5=95ea3b6dc2b15516a948d58efa84d2f9", "2.

Along with graphene, inorg. nanosheets have thus increasingly attracted fundamental research interest because they have the potential to be used as dielec. alternatives in next-generation nanoelectronics.  Here, we review the progress made in the properties of dielec. nanosheets, highlighting emerging functionalities in electronic applications.

Rationalization of this behavior at the at. scale is provided by combining CO adsorption monitored by FTIR and DFT calcns. (clusters and periodic models).  We demonstrate that the acido-basic sites are located at the external surface of the material or at defects, but not in the microporosity of ZIF-8.  A great variety of sites are found the surface: OH and NH groups, hydrogenocarbonates, low-coordinated Zn atoms, and free N- moieties belonging to linkers.  Their proportions depend on the operating conditions (temp. and pressure).  The acido-basicity of the surface is then probed by adsorption of CO at low temp.  In parallel, the species present are mapped by DFT calcns. combined with a thermodn. model.  An assignment of the CO region of the FTIR spectra can thus be proposed.  The complex IR spectrum is attributed to the coexistence of classical C-adducts of CO with acid sites and other modes on basic sites (O-adducts and side-on adducts).  Adsorption energies and CO frequency shifts show that some strong Lewis sites exist (in particular ZnII species), as well as strong Bronsted acid sites (NH groups), together with basic sites (OH groups and N- moieties).  By calcg. the co-adsorption of a model ester (Me acetate) and methanol, we show the prevailing role of ZnII species as acid sites, combined with N- moieties and OH groups as basic ones, in detg. the catalytic properties of ZIF-8.

The BET anal. is the std. method for detg. surface areas from nitrogen adsorption isotherms and was originally derived for multilayer gas adsorption onto flat surfaces.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of cryst., porous materials that exhibit very large BET surface areas.  These materials are microporous and possess surfaces that are far from flat.  In some MOFs, adsorption occurs through a pore-filling mechanism rather than by layer formation.  Thus, it is unclear whether BET surface area nos. reported for these materials are truly meaningful.  Given the std. practice of reporting BET surface areas for novel porous materials, a crit. test of the BET method is much needed.  Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict adsorption isotherms for nitrogen in MOFs.  The predicted isotherms were used as pseudoexperimental data to test the applicability of the BET theory for obtaining surface areas of microporous MOFs.  BET surface areas calcd. from the simulated isotherms agree very well with the accessible surface areas calcd. directly from the crystal structures in a geometric fashion.  The surface areas agree well with exptl. reports in the literature.  These results provide a strong validation that the BET theory can be used to obtain surface areas of MOFs.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXms12gur0%253D&md5=afdfa7c0f69c8645a456afb207431957", "32.

In this work we provide insights at a mol. level on the mechanisms governing the ZIF-8 structural deformation during mol. adsorption.  We demonstrate that the ZIF-8 structural deformation during the adsorption of different mols. at cryogenic temp. goes beyond the gas-induced rotation of the imidazolate linkers.  We combine exptl. and simulation studies to demonstrate that this deformation is governed by the polarizability and mol. size and shape of the gases, and that the stepped adsorption behavior is defined by the packing arrangement of the guest inside the host.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XlsVartbc%253D&md5=ce9539a2e761d22eb95cd92e5c83885c"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-35/jp5081466/production/images/small/jp-2014-081466_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-35/jp5081466/production/images/small/jp-2014-081466_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-35/jp5081466/production/images/small/jp-2014-081466_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-35/jp5081466/production/images/small/jp-2014-081466_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-35/jp5081466/production/images/small/jp-2014-081466_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-35/jp5081466/production/images/small/jp-2014-081466_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2014/jpccck.2014.118.issue-35/jp5081466/production/images/small/jp-2014-081466_0008.gif\">"]}
