The incorporation of N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine (mmen) into H3(Cu4Cl)3(BTTri)8 (CuBTTri; H3BTTri = 1,3,5-tri(1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)benzene), a H2O-stable, triazolate-bridged framework, is shown to drastically enhance CO2 adsorption, resulting in one of the best performing metal-org. frameworks for CO2 sepn. reported to date.  High porosity was maintained despite stoichiometric attachment of mmen to the open metal sites of the framework, resulting in a BET surface area of 870 m2 g-1.  At 25\u00b0 under a 0.15 bar CO2/0.75 bar N2 mixt., mmen-CuBTTri adsorbs 2.38 mmol CO2 g-1 (9.5%) with a selectivity of 327, as detd. using Ideal Adsorbed Soln. Theory (IAST).  The high capacity and selectivity are consequences of the exceptionally large isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, calcd. to be -96 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage.  IR spectra support chemisorption between amines and CO2 as one of the primary mechanisms of uptake.  Despite the large initial heat of adsorption, the CO2 uptake was fully reversible and the framework could be easily regenerated at 60\u00b0, enabling a cycling time of just 27 min with no loss of capacity over 72 adsorption/desorption cycles.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhtFagtrzM&md5=eeb691022dc2b81537158452bbc9f11c", "5.
