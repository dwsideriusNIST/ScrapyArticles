Beyond the simple paradigm of changing the linker or the metal,", "(1)", " novel strategies are arising that yield new structure types from a limited number of starting materials. For example, we have recently demonstrated that copolymerization of two linkers bearing the same functionality can generate a high-performance microporous/mesoporous material, UMCM-1.", "(2)", " Alternatively, the incorporation of two metals can increase the diversity of MCPs.

Direct metal substitutions to generate series of isostructural homometallic coordination polymers are quite rare. It is therefore significant that metal substitution can be achieved for the synthesis of mixed-metal MCPs that remain isostructural to the homometallic counterparts. This strategy was used for the preparation of heterobimetallic derivatives of MOF-4, MOF-39, and a Zn-BTEC MCP.

This material has been synthesized with the aim to develop a heterogeneous PtII counterpart to homogeneous metal-org. complexes having C-H activating properties.  The first account focused on the MOF synthesis and on structural and stability characterization of the material.  In the present work, a multitechnique approach has been adopted to investigate the effect of solvent removal and the reversibility of this process.  Structural features have been investigated by means of powder x-ray diffraction and extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy at both Pt and Gd L3-edges.  Electronic properties have been studied with diffuse reflectance surface UV-vis and x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopies.  Finally, IR spectroscopy has been used to det. the vibration properties.  Thermogravimetric methods have been used to quantify the water loss.  X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been used to compare the Pt environment in the periodic MOF structure, in related mol. complexes, and in the linkers.  Our results demonstrate that the environment around Pt is more or less unaffected by the incorporation of the Pt centers in the mol. complexes into the 3D extended framework of the Pt-Gd MOF.  The principle of using known homogeneous complexes as building blocks for the construction of single-site heterogeneous catalysts therefore seems applicable in the present case.  Removal of solvent water mols. from the internal voids of the as-prepd. MOF presents an opportunity to attain a porous material with accessible PtII sites.  We observe that the structure undergoes a reversible loss of long-range order upon dehydration at ambient temp.  The environment of Gd is somewhat perturbed in the dehydration/hydration process, while that of Pt is almost unaffected.
