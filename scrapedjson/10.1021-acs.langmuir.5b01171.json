The exptl. steaming method allows for high throughput screening of materials stability over a broad range of steam levels as well as in-depth investigation of structural transformations under more highly resolved conditions, while the cluster model presented here yields the correct trends in hydrothermal stability.  Good agreement was obsd. between predicted relative stabilities of materials by mol. modeling and exptl. results.  Fundamental information from these studies has provided insight into how metal compn. and coordination, chem. functionality of org. linker, framework dimensionality, and interpenetration affect the relative stabilities of PCP materials.  This work suggests that the strength of the bond between the metal oxide cluster and the bridging linker is important in detg. the hydrothermal stability of the PCP.  Although the flexibility of the framework plays a role, it is not as important as the metal-linker bond strength.

This paper reports that a crystal engineering or reticular chem. strategy which controls pore functionality and pore size in a series of MOM with coordinately satd. metal centers and periodically arrayed hexafluorosilicate anions (SiF52-) enables a kinetics and thermodn. sweet spots offering high volumetric uptake at low CO2 partial pressure (<0.15 bar).  Most importantly, such MOM offer an unprecedented CO2 sorption selectivity over N2, H2, and CH4, even in the presence of moisture.  Thus, these MOM are relevant to CO2 sepn. in the context of post-combustion (flue gas, CO2/N2), pre-combustion (shifted synthesis gas stream, CO2/H2), and natural gas upgrading (natural gas clean-up, CO2/CH4).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXjsFCntbg%253D&md5=56941673abb6b13f920476a593dfeb98", "10.

In this study, the capture of CO2 from a 12% synthetic flue gas stream at a relative humidity of 95% at 30\u00b0 was exptl. examd.  A 13X adsorbent was used and the migration of the water and its subsequent impact on capture performance was evaluated.  Binary breakthrough of CO2/water vapor was performed and indicated a significant effect of water on CO2 adsorption capacity, as expected.  Cyclic expts. indicate that the water zone migrates a quarter of the way into the column and stabilizes its position so that CO2 capture is still possible although decreased.  The formation of a water zone creates a \"cold spot\" which has implications for the system performance.  The recovery of CO2 dropped from 78.5 to 60% when moving from dry to wet flue gas while the productivity dropped by 22%.  Although the concn. of water leaving the bed under vacuum was 27%(vol), the low vacuum pressure prevented condensation of water in this stream.  However, the vacuum pump acted as a condenser and separator to remove bulk water.  An important consequence of the presence of a water zone was to elevate the vacuum level thereby reducing CO2 working capacity.  Thus although there is a detrimental effect of water on CO2 capture, long term recovery of CO2 is still possible in a single VSA process.  Pre-drying of the flue gas steam is not required.  However, careful consideration of the impact of water and accommodation thereof must be made particularly when the feed stream temp. increases resulting in higher feed water concn.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXjsFajs7s%253D&md5=504905ed7b8b4a30e4bde8f1006d63f2", "11.

Due to its amphiphilic property, graphene oxide (GO) can achieve a variety of nanostructures with different morphologies (for example membranes, hydrogel, crumpled particles, hollow spheres, sack-cargo particles, Pickering emulsions, and so on) by self-assembly.  The self-assembly is mostly derived from the self-concn. of GO sheets at various interfaces, including liq.-air, liq.-liq. and liq.-solid interfaces.  This paper gives a comprehensive review of these assembly phenomena of GO at the three types of interfaces, the derived interfacial self-assembly techniques, and the as-obtained assembled materials and their properties.  The interfacial self-assembly of GO, enabled by its fantastic features including the amphiphilicity, the neg. charged nature, abundant oxygen-contg. groups and two-dimensional flexibility, is highlighted as an easy and well-controlled strategy for the design and prepn. of functionalized carbon materials, and the use of self-assembly for uniform hybridization is addressed for prepg. hybrid carbon materials with various functions.

Unlike other MOF/GO composites reported in previous studies, these materials are water-stable.  Ammonia adsorption capacities on the composites are higher than the ones calcd. for the phys. mixt. of components, suggesting the presence of a synergetic effect between the MOF and graphene layers.  The increased porosity and dispersive forces being the consequence of the presence of graphene layers are responsible for the enhanced adsorption.  In addn. to its retention via phys. forces, ammonia is also adsorbed via binding to the copper sites in HKUST-1 and then, progressively, via reaction with the MOF component.  This reactive adsorption is visible through two successive changes of the adsorbents' color during the breakthrough tests.
