Uncontrolled massive release of the primary greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) into atm. from anthropogenic activities poses a big threat and adversely affects our global climate and natural environment.  One promising approach to mitigate CO2 emission is carbon capture and storage (CCS), in which ideal adsorbent materials with high storage capacity and excellent adsorption selectivity over other gases are urgently needed.  For practical applications in CO2 capture from flue gas of power plants, the biggest single contributor of anthropogenic CO2 emission, the adsorbent materials must also be chem. stable, be easy to regenerate with minimal energy input, and be easily synthesized with low capital cost.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), highly cryst. porous materials constructed by metal ions and org. ligands, have emerged as a class of excellent adsorbent materials for carbon capture.  Great progress in MOF materials for CO2 capture has been made in the past and reviewed accordingly, but new discoveries are constantly being made as the field quickly grows.  In this paper, we provide a short review on the most recent advances in using MOFs for CO2 adsorption, storage, and sepn. that are directly related to CO2 capture.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.  Assocd. with each net is a natural tiling, which is a natural partition of space into space-filling tiles.
