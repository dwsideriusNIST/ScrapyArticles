The simulated adsorption isotherm for ZSM-5 reproduces relatively well type IV of the experimental adsorption isotherm. However, the simulated adsorbed amounts overestimate the experimental data. This result can be explained by the fact that molecular simulations are carried out for perfect, infinite ZSM-5 crystals while the experimental sample is not well-crystallized.

Such defects are generated upon using tetrapropylammonium as a template in the conventional hydrothermal synthesis process (instead of fluorine-based processes which are known to provide silanol-free samples). The role of such defects is further confirmed by the fact that the simulated and experimental adsorption isotherms for ZSM-5 can be superimposed when normalized to the maximum adsorbed amount (Figure S2 in the ", "Supporting Information", ").", "In the case of mesoporous MCM-41, the adsorption isotherm resembles that observed experimentally; water adsorption at low pressures occurs through the formation of an adsorbed film at the pore surface.

While the difference between the simulated and experimental data for MCM-41 can be explained by the different pore sizes between the two sets of data, the difference for MIL-100 is thought to be due to the choice of water model used in this study. This idea is consistent with the previous work of De Lange et al.", "(36)", " in which it was demonstrated that the choice of water\u2013adsorbent interactions significantly affects the comparison between experimental and molecular adsorption isotherms in MOF.

These results suggest that the adsorption and affinity of the gas for each surface plays a key role in the solubility in the confined solvent.

This behavior is due to the strong electrostatic interactions between the charges carried by the water molecules and the atoms of the host materials (Ow for the zeolite and MCM-41 silica and Cr1 and F for MIL-100). In the case of the MCM-41 and ZSM-5 materials, the gas molecules are found to be adsorbed between the local minima in the ", "g", "(", "r", ") functions for water with the host frameworks. In the case of the MIL-100 material, the gas molecules also tend to be located away from the pore walls although not in water density minima because water does not exhibit layering in the ", "g", "(", "r", ") functions for this host framework. These results suggest that oversolubility for all the systems considered in this work falls in the category of enhanced bulklike solubility mechanisms (and not to an adsorption-driven effect). In particular, considering that for all systems considered in this work, oversolubility in MCM-41 porous silica corresponds to bulklike enhancement arising from gas solubility in the solvent density minima, such an oversolubility is expected to increase upon increasing the specific surface area of the sample. Indeed, given that layering occurs for a few layers of solvent (about 2 layers) close to the pore surface, oversolubility due to gas solubility between the solvent layers must be proportional to the specific surface area, which scales as 1/", "D", ".", "The results above are consistent with our previous work", "(12)", " in which oversolubility for solubilized gases with weak interactions with the host matrix (or at least weaker than the solvent\u2013host interactions) pertains to a bulklike solubility phenomenon. In the case of such bulklike oversolubility phenomena, we have shown that the local gas solubility can be described by considering the bulk solubility taken at a density equal to the solvent local density. In the case of ZSM-5, gas oversolubility in confined water follows Henry\u2019s law in the pressure range up to 2 bar for CO", "2", " and 10 bar for both CH", "4", " and N", "2", ", i.e., the amount of gas solubilized in the confined solvent is proportional to the pressure of gas above the solvent. However, at higher pressures and in the case of MCM-41 and MIL-100, the classical Henry\u2019s law breaks down. Considering that oversolubility obeys a bulklike solubility phenomenon for all these systems, it is important to recognize that the differences between Henry\u2019s law domains and Langmuir domains do not pertain to separate mechanisms. In fact, these different domains simply reflect that the limit of validity of Henry\u2019s regime is reached at lower pressures for some gas\u2013solvent\u2013solid systems than for others. In particular, the results above suggest that, as expected, the pressure range where Henry\u2019s regime holds decreases upon increasing the strength of the gas\u2013surface and gas\u2013solvent interactions.", "Figure 6.

However, we note that much larger enhancement factors can be reached with MCM-41 and MOF materials.

The increase in the gas concentration at surfaces is the strongest with the least soluble gas, N", "2", ", and weakest for the most soluble gas, CO", "2", ". Although the three gases also differ in their interactions with the walls, these interactions play a secondary role in the enhanced solubility phenomenon. The fact that the strongest oversolubility is observed for MIL-100 and MCM-41 to a smaller extent is due to the significant ordering of water in the vicinity of the surface of these host solids (which necessarily boosts oversolubility as more gas molecules can be adsorbed in the local minima of the water density). This result shows that host materials leading to significant ordering of water have to be preferred in order to achieve large oversolubilities.", "Figure 8.

We further showed that such an oversolubility, which is observed over a large pressure range, pertains to a bulklike solubility mechanism where the gas gets adsorbed in regions where the local water density is low. This result suggests that host nanoporous materials leading to significant ordering of confined water, i.e., with both high and low water density domains, lead to large gas uptakes. Such a bulklike oversolubility is consistent with the fact that the N", "2", ", CO", "2", ", and CH", "4", " have weaker interactions with the host frameworks than water. Thanks to such oversolubility effects, very large gas uptakes can be reached. As an example, we found that, depending on the host matrix, apparent solubilities from 10 to a few 100 times larger than the bulk solubility can be reached for moderate pressures (pressure of approximately a few bars). The increase in the gas concentration is the strongest with the least soluble gas, N", "2", ", and weakest for the most soluble gas, CO", "2", ". The fact that the largest oversolubility enhancement factors (ratio of the confined to the bulk solubilities) are observed for gases with weak interactions is promising for potential applications. Indeed, while gases with strong interactions (typically dipolar molecules) are easy to capture through adsorption effects, weakly interacting molecules (typically small nonpolar molecules such as rare gases or H", "2", " or N", "2", ") are difficult to separate. Consequently, while hybrid adsorbents still might be insufficient to design cost-effective and efficient processes, they allow the improvement of capture and enrichment of such small molecules compared to bulklike or adsorption-based processes. In particular, these results allow envisioning the ", "design", " of novel processes using such hybrid adsorbents. Such processes can also be extended to heterogeneous catalysis as the local amount of reactants that can be reached locally (close to the confining host surface) is known to play a key role.", " ", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Computational Details", "Results", "Discussion", "Conclusion", "References", "Supporting Information", "The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ", "ACS Publications website", " at DOI: ", "10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b06660", ".", "Properties of the three solid models as well as different gas adsorption isotherms (", "PDF", ")", "The authors declare no competing financial interest.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Computational Details", "Results", "Discussion", "Conclusion", "References", "Acknowledgment", "We thank Dr. Caroline Mellot-Draznieks for her help with the atomic model of the MOF material.

This raises questions as to how significant gas adsorption is in hydrophobic confinement, whether it is conducive to water depletion at such surfaces, and ultimately if it can facilitate the liq.-to-gas phase transition in the confinement.  Open Ensemble mol. simulations have been used here to det. satd. concns. of atm. gases in water-filled apolar confinements as a function of pore width at varied gas fugacities.  For paraffin-like confinements of widths barely exceeding the mech. instability threshold (spinodal) of the liq.-to-vapor transition of confined water (aq. film thickness between three and four mol. diams.), mean gas concns. in the pore were found to exceed the bulk values by a factor of \u223c30 or \u223c15 in cases of N2 and CO2, resp.  At ambient conditions, this does not result in visible changes in the water d. profile next to the surfaces.  Whereas the barrier to capillary evapn. has been found to decrease in the presence of dissolved gas (Leung, K.; Luzar, A.; and Bratko, D. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2003, 90, 065502), gas concns. much higher than those obsd. at normal atm. conditions would be needed to produce noticeable changes in the kinetics of capillary evapn.  In simulations, dissolved gas concns. corresponding to fugacities above \u223c40 bar for N2, or \u223c2 bar for CO2, were required to trigger expulsion of water from a hydrocarbon slit as narrow as 1.4 nm.  For nanosized pore widths corresponding to the mech. instability threshold or above, no significant coupling between adsorption layers at opposing confinement walls was obsd.

The hybrid adsorbent is prepd. by confining a phys. solvent (OMCTS) into the pores of a mimetic MCM-41 solid support.  As a result, simulated adsorption isotherms of CO2 nicely match the exptl. data for three distinctive systems: Bulk solvent, raw MCM-41, and hybrid MCM-41.  The microscopic mechanisms underlying the apparition of enhanced soly. are then clearly identified.  In fact, the presence of solvent mols. favors the layering of CO2 mols. within the pores; therefore, the CO2 soly. in the hybrid adsorbent markedly increases in comparison to that found in the raw adsorbent as well as in the bulk solvent.  In addn., a good understanding of confined solvents' properties and solid surface structures is essential to fully evaluate the efficiency of hybrid adsorbents in capturing CO2.  The sorbent-solid interactions along with the solvent mol. size's impact on CO2 soly. are therefore investigated in this study.  We found that an ideal hybrid system should possess a weak solvent-solid interaction but a strong solvent-CO2 interaction.  Besides, an optimal solvent size is obtained for the enhanced CO2 soly. in the hybrid system.  According to the simulation results, the solvent layer builds pseudomicropores inside the mesoporous MCM-41, enabling more CO2 mols. to be absorbed under the greater influence of spatial confinement and surface interaction.

The affinity with CO2 is enhanced by addn. of a functional group, and the constricted pore is formed by interpenetration of the framework; both lead to a larger isosteric heat and Henry's const. and subsequently a stronger adsorption at low pressures.

N2 adsorption isotherms for the samples under study exhibited remarkably sharp capillary condensation steps.  The adsorption isotherm for the highly ordered 4.8 nm MCM-41 featured a narrow hysteresis loop with parallel adsorption and desorption branches.  This behavior is probably a feature of N2 adsorption in ideal cylindrical pores of this size and is distinctly different from the previously reported behavior of MCM-41 with pore sizes in the range 4-5.5 nm, which had triangular hysteresis loops on their N2 adsorption isotherms.  All MCM-41 materials had remarkably narrow pore size distributions, which showed that fine-tuning of the pore size is easily achievable for the synthesis procedure used.  The pore wall thickness was found to increase as the pore size increased.  The pore wall thickness detd. using TEM was somewhat larger than that obtained using the combined XRD/adsorption anal., which was attributed to inherent features of these detn. methods.

Low-pressure adsorption studies of uncalcined ethanol-washed MCM-41 samples revealed that external surfaces of their particles were covered by relatively dense layers of surfactant ions.

The computational effort for these MOFs with large unit cells was reduced by using primitive unit cells that were 4 times smaller.  The results demonstrate that both adsorbate-adsorbent and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions control the adsorption process.  At low loadings, before all coordinatively unsatd. chromium sites are occupied, the MOF structure dets. the shape of the isotherm, and the mol. model for the polar sorbate is less important.  A clear difference was found between fully fluorinated and hydroxylated MIL-101 structures for both methanol and water, demonstrating that partial charges on Cr drive the initial shape of the isotherm.  At higher loadings, adsorbate-adsorbate interactions become much more important, and the choice of the water model, in particular, is crucial for the agreement between exptl. and simulation results.  The simplest SPC/E model reproduces the exptl. results with the best accuracy, in contrast to more advanced models such as TIP5PEw, which can be explained by the slightly stronger Coulombic interactions predicted by the former.  For methanol, the general TraPPE force field performs well.  A composite type IV isotherm for methanol and a composite type V isotherm for water, according to the IUPAC classification, were found.  The heats of adsorption are in line with these conclusions.  This effect of the sorbate model was not obsd. in adsorption in microporous materials, and it highlights the complexity behind mol. simulations in periodic mesostructured materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXks1Cqt7g%253D&md5=a3d4b5979e1d5685d3974ee7ee3ab980", "37.
