COMOC-2 is an extended version of the MIL-47 framework with 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid linkers instead of terephthalic acid.  Adsorption isotherms of methane to propane, ethylene, and propylene were detd. with a gravimetric uptake technique at temps. between 281 and 303 K.  A pronounced breathing effect was obsd. (in contrast to the more rigid MIL-47 framework) in which the adsorption capacity increases by more than a factor of 2 at a given breathing pressure.  The breathing pressure decreases with increasing hydrocarbon mol. wt.  The typical two-step isotherms are nearly identical for alkanes and alkenes, in accordance with the nonpolar nature of the material.  Binary isotherms of ethane and propane were also measured with the gravimetric uptake technique at different temps. and total pressures.  The mixt. isotherms and breathing transition pressures were predicted by relying on the osmotic framework adsorbed soln. theory (OFAST).  Finally, the sepn. potential of COMOC-2 for ethane/propane mixts. was looked into using breakthrough expts. for different compns. and different pressures.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2MXntVCgu7k%253D&md5=acd6d66f8c44c9be2b0c33832f0e5188"], "figures": []}
