The main existing CO2 capture technologies are discussed in the context of capture performance considerations of aq. alkanolamine solns. and porous solids such as zeolites and activated carbons.  Schematic diagrams are presented of idealized temp. swing adsorption, pressure swing adsorption, and vacuum swing adsorption processes for regenerating solid adsorbent in a fixed-bed column.  The structural features and CO2 adsorption characteristics of isoreticular metal-org. frameworks (MOF) are discussed in detail.  The high-pressure adsorption capacities of 36 MOF and the lower-pressure adsorption capacities of many more MOF, at 293-319 K, are tabulated.  The various types of functionalities that have been explored to date for prepg. materials with enhanced CO2 capture performance are outlined, including amines, strongly polarizing org. functionalities, and exposed metal cation sites.  The synthesis of continuous films of MOF and their use in membranes for gas sepn. are examd., with the tabulation of the CO2 sepn. performance of MOF mixed-matrix membranes.

The challenge of developing effective sepn. and purifn. technologies which have much smaller energy footprints is greater for CO2 than for other gases; in addn. to its involvement in climate change, CO2 is an impurity in natural gas, biogas (biomass-based natural gas), syngas (CO/H2, the main H2 source for refineries), and many other gas streams.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "(b) ", "Schaate", ", ", "A.", "; ", "Roy", ", ", "P.", "; ", "Godt", ", ", "A.", "; ", "Lippke", ", ", "J.", "; ", "Waltz", ", ", "F.", "; ", "Wiebcke", ", ", "M.", "; ", "Behrens", ", ", "P.", " ", "Chem.\u2014Eur.

Addn. of benzoic acid also affects the size and morphol. of Zr-bpdc and, addnl., makes the synthesis of Zr-bpdc highly reproducible.  The control of crystal and particle size is proven by powder XRD, SEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements.

Potential solvent regions are identified automatically.  The contribution of the obsd. contents to the total structure factor is calcd. via a discrete Fourier transformation, and incorporated in a further least-squares refinement of the ordered part of the structure.  The procedure is iterated a few times to convergence.  This mixed discrete-atom and continuous solvent-area model refinement approach greatly improves the quality of discrete at. parameters.  An electron count over the solvent region in the final difference electron-d. map provides a convenient est. for the no. of solvent mols. present in the unit cell.  The application of the method to 4 structures is described.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK3cXltVKrtbs%253D&md5=baf9c8008a28740c487bce772ea48aca"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2013/jacsat.2013.135.issue-20/ja401429x/production/images/small/ja-2013-01429x_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2013/jacsat.2013.135.issue-20/ja401429x/production/images/small/ja-2013-01429x_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2013/jacsat.2013.135.issue-20/ja401429x/production/images/small/ja-2013-01429x_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2013/jacsat.2013.135.issue-20/ja401429x/production/images/small/ja-2013-01429x_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2013/jacsat.2013.135.issue-20/ja401429x/production/images/small/ja-2013-01429x_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2013/jacsat.2013.135.issue-20/ja401429x/production/images/small/ja-2013-01429x_0005.gif\">"]}
