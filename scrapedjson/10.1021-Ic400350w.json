The review starts with some of the fundamental aspects of RIXS, after which are presented typical exptl. data and their theor. interpretation for various materials.  The 1st class of materials considered is semiconductors and insulators (Si, C, and BN), which are typical systems with weak electron correlation, and the data are interpreted based on electronic states described by an energy-band model.  Effects of symmetry of electronic states and electron momentum conservation are discussed.  At the opposite extreme are rare-earth systems (metals and oxides), in which the 4f electrons are almost localized with strong electron correlation.  The observations are interpreted based on the effects of intra-at. multiplet coupling and weak interat. electron transfer, which are well described with an Anderson impurity model or a cluster model.  In this context a narrowing of spectral width in the excitation spectrum, polarization dependence, and the MCD in ferromagnetic materials are discussed.  The authors then consider transition-metal compds., materials with electron correlation strengths intermediate between semiconductors and rare-earth systems.  In these interesting cases there is an interplay of intra-at. and interat. electronic interactions that leads to limitations of both the band model and the Anderson impurity model.
