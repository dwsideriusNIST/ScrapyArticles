The synthesis of a few elec. conducting MOFs and their known structural flexibility suggest that MOF-based electronic devices exploiting these properties could be constructed.  It is clear, however, that new fabrication methods are required to take advantage of the unique properties of MOFs and extend their use to the realms of electronic circuitry.  In this Concepts article, the authors describe the basic functional elements needed to fabricate electronic devices and summarize the current state of relevant MOF research, and then review recent work in which MOFs serve as active components in electronic devices.  Finally, the authors propose a high-level roadmap for device-related MOF research, the objective of which is to stimulate thinking within the MOF community concerning the development these materials for applications including sensing, photonics, and microelectronics.

Compared to conventionally used microporous inorg. materials such as zeolites, these org. structures have the potential for more flexible rational design, through control of the architecture and functionalization of the pores.  So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.  This simple and potentially universal design strategy is currently being pursued in the synthesis of new phases and composites, and for gas-storage applications.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1MXnvFSiuro%253D&md5=68f27e20a7e4e15ea2c2f49a2a61e98a", "14.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "19.
