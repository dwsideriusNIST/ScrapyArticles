This demonstrates that MIL-101 could act as the stationary phase to separate the three amino acids. Intuitively, the molecular weight and hydrophilicity of solute are expected to play a major role in the separation. With the largest molecular weight among the three amino acids, Trp transports at the slowest velocity. Arg is the most hydrophilic and interacts the most strongly with the polar mobile phase (water). Therefore, the velocity of Arg is the fastest compared to Phe and Trp. This simple analysis qualitatively interprets the elution order.

Apparently, the three amino acids interact with the mobile phase more strongly than with the stationary phase. As already mentioned, Arg is the most hydrophilic, carrying a positive charge and interacting with polar solvent the most strongly. Thus, Arg tends to reside in the mobile phase and moves away from the stationary phase. On the other hand, Phe and Trp consist of phenyl rings and have favorable \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions with the phenyl rings in MIL-101.

Therefore, the LC separation can be attributed to the cooperative solute\u2013solvent and solute\u2013framework interactions. The strongest interaction of Arg\u2013water leads to the fastest transport velocity of Arg; meanwhile, Arg\u2013framework interaction is the weakest.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.  We may expect that highly stable MOFs having a large surface area and pore vol., together with many open metal sites and embedded catalysts for hydrogen spillover, would provide some pos. results for H storage at ambient temp.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhs1GlsbjM&md5=dd1f08beefd27cce77d88e466551c1af", "4.

Their versatile architectures and customizable chem. functionalities make MOFs attractive candidates for constructing sepg. membranes with high performance.  A no. of excellent advancements in fabricating mol. sieve membranes based on MOFs have been made in recent years.  Unlike traditional inorg. zeolites with \"rigid\" frameworks, MOFs are in general structurally flexible, which is generally used to explain the absence of a clear cut-off, as expected from the pore size estd. from rigid framework models.  On the other hand, this dynamic structural behavior of the MOFs is beneficial when elasticity is favorable, for example, in adsorption-based sepn., because such flexible materials can exhibit high selectivity for guest inclusion by adapting their framework structure accordingly.  Recently, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subfamily of MOFs, received tremendous attention because of their exceptional thermal and chem. stability.  One particularly interesting member of this family is ZIF-8 (with the formula zinc(2-methylimidazolate)2).  ZIF-8 represents an appropriate model system and has found many applications, including selective adsorption, membrane-based sepn., chromatog., catalysis, and as a sensor.  In contrast to the hydrothermal synthesis of nano-zeolites (e.g. silicalite-1) at high temp. and autogenous pressure, the prepn. of ZIF-8 nanoparticles can be conducted at room temp. in soln., which is lower cost, saves time,and much more convenient.  Moreover, the superhydrophobicity of ZIF-8 results in it showing no adsorption of water before the onset of capillary condensation.  All the above-mentioned characteristics suggest that ZIF-8 nanoparticles could be used as fillers in mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) for the recovery of org. compds. from aq. solns. by adopting organophilic pervaporation (OPV) technol.  Pervaporation is a membrane process based on a sorption-diffusion mechanism, and is considered the most promising technol. for mol.-scale liq./ liq. sepns.

In Na-rho-ZMOF, water is preferentially adsorbed over ethanol due to its strong interaction with nonframework Na+ ions and ionic framework, and the adsorption selectivity of water-ethanol is higher at a lower compn. of water.  With increasing water compn., water diffusivity in Na-rho-ZMOF increases but ethanol diffusivity decreases, and the diffusion selectivity of water-ethanol increases.

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters.  By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for mol. dynamics simulation.  It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields.  In addn., it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints.  The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized.  Nonequil. dynamics and free energy detns. are incorporated.  Interfaces with popular quantum-chem. packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations.  The package includes about 100 utility and anal. programs.  GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.
