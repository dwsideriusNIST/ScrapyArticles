We implemented the approach in either of two ways. For the first, depending on the identity of the parent linker, incorporation of the fragment (isophthalic acid) leads to missing linkages between copper paddlewheels, or it can eliminate a copper paddlewheel cluster. Therefore, the incorporation of this fragment creates defects and increases both the surface area and pore volume. In the second case, the fragment (5-perfluorobutylisophthalic acid) carries a sterically demanding functional group. Its incorporation reduces the pore volume and surface area but provides a means for introducing new functionalities and binding sites for gas adsorption. We studied the effect of defect creation on high-pressure gas adsorption properties. In the case of ", "HKUST-1", ", where both gas\u2013copper metal and gas\u2013framework interactions are important due to small size of cages, the net effect of defect creation is to decrease the total adsorption, even though both the surface area and pore volume are increased. There is essentially zero change, however, in the working capacity for CH", "4", " storage. In the case of ", "NU-125", ", where the cages are comparatively large, the effect of defects on the total adsorption is negligible at room temperature; the defects engender substantial increases only at lower temperatures. However, for CO", "2", ", which interacts more strongly with the MOF than does either H", "2", " or CH", "4", ", the introduction of defect sites seems to increase the total uptake, even at room temperature. These results shed light on the nature of gas adsorption in MOFs and how it can be controlled/tuned by intentionally introducing defects. It seems reasonable to expect that defect creation by linker fragmentation will prove effective in usefully altering the sorption properties of other MOFs.

However, common methods for functionalization (including pre- and post-synthetic modifications) of the internal surface of a MOF reduce the pore size of the MOF because the addnl. functional groups fill up the pores.  We present a metal-ligand-fragment coassembly strategy for the introduction of (meso)pores functionalized with various substituent groups on the ligand fragments.  Astonishingly, this new functionalization strategy increases the pore vol. of a MOF instead of reducing it.  Since the ligand fragments are often readily available or easily prepd., the new procedure for synthesis of the modified MOFs becomes much easier and more applicable than existing approaches.  Remarkably, mesopores can be generated conveniently and controllably by the coassembly of a ligand and its fragment contg. the desired functional groups.  The fragment/ligand ratio has been optimized to preserve the parent structure and to promote max. mesopore introduction, which has led to a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of a series of functional groups for the adsorption of guest mols.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xhs12mtrzL&md5=0a4e24d55a6c9344eef8665a87a5bd62", "38.

In its perfect crystal structure, each Zr metal center is fully coordinated by 12 org. linkers to form a highly connected framework.  Using high-resoln. neutron power diffraction technique, we found the first direct structural evidence showing that real UiO-66 material contains significant amt. of missing-linker defects, an unusual phenomenon for MOFs.  The concn. of the missing-linker defects is surprisingly high, \u223c10% in our sample, effectively reducing the framework connection from 12 to \u223c11.  We show that by varying the concn. of the acetic acid modulator and the synthesis time, the linker vacancies can be tuned systematically, leading to dramatically enhanced porosity.  We obtained samples with pore vols. ranging from 0.44 to 1.0 cm3/g and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas ranging from 1000 to 1600 m2/g, the largest values of which are \u223c150% and \u223c60% higher than the theor. values of defect-free UiO-66 crystal, resp.  The linker vacancies also have profound effects on the gas adsorption behaviors of UiO-66, in particular CO2.  Finally, comparing the gas adsorption of hydroxylated and dehydroxylated UiO-66, we found that the former performs systematically better than the latter (particularly for CO2) suggesting the beneficial effect of the -OH groups.  This finding is of great importance because hydroxylated UiO-66 is the practically more relevant, non-air-sensitive form of this MOF.  The preferred gas adsorption on the metal center was confirmed by neutron diffraction measurements, and the gas binding strength enhancement by the -OH group was further supported by our first-principles calcns.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtValsLrL&md5=c1ead8cbafaae77968f37490e2bb14f6", "39.

This material was synthesized in high yield on a gram-scale in a single-batch synthesis.  Methane adsorption isotherms were measured over a wide pressure range (0.1-58 bar) and repeated over twelve cycles on the same sample, which showed no detectable degrdn.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.  Hence, one of the important challenges going forward is to find ways to pack MOFs efficiently without serious damage or to synthesize MOFs that can withstand substantial mech. pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtV2msbrN&md5=23f9bfad78f204569f0bf7c902d42dca", "51.

To illustrate the most important properties for evaluating adsorbents for natural gas storage and for designing a next generation of improved materials, six metal-org. frameworks and an activated carbon, with a range of surface areas, pore structures, and surface chemistries representative of the most promising adsorbents for methane storage, are evaluated in detail.  High-pressure methane adsorption isotherms are used to compare gravimetric and volumetric capacities, isosteric heats of adsorption, and usable storage capacities.  Addnl., the relative importance of increasing volumetric capacity, rather than gravimetric capacity, for extending the driving range of natural gas vehicles is highlighted.
