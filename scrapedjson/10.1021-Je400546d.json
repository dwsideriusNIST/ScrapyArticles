On a flat surface, the primary extensive property is the area of the solid.  As applications became more significant, necessitating microporous solids, early researchers such as McBain and Coolidge implemented the Gibbs definition by invoking a ref. state for microporous solids.  The mass of solid is used as a primary extensive property because surface area loses its phys. meaning for microporous solids.  A ref. state is used to fix the hypothetical hyperdividing surface typically using helium as a probe mol., resulting in the commonly used excess adsorption; experimentalists measure this ref. state for each new sample.  Mol. simulations, however, provide abs. adsorption.  Theoreticians perform helium simulations to convert abs. to excess adsorption, mimicking expts. for comparison.  This current structure of adsorption thermodn. is rigorous (if the conditions for ref. state helium measurements are completely disclosed) but laborious.  In addn., many studies show that helium, or any other probe mol. for that matter, does adsorb, albeit to a small extent.  We propose a novel thermodn. framework, net adsorption, which completely circumvents the use of probe mols. to fix the ref. state for each microporous sample.  Using net adsorption, experimentalists calibrate their app. only once without any sample in the system.  Theoreticians can directly calc. net adsorption; no addnl. simulations with a probe gas are necessary.

The anal. of hydrogen adsorption in a metal-org. framework is used as an example to illustrate the methodol., which allows the estn. of the abs. adsorption into nanoporous systems.  Further advantages of employing this anal. are that adsorption systems can be described using a small no. of parameters, and that excess and abs. isotherms can be extrapolated and used to predict adsorption behavior at higher pressures and over different temp. ranges.  Thermodn. calcns., using the exact Clapeyron equation and the Clausius-Clapeyron approxn. applied to the example dataset, are presented and compared.  Conventional compression of hydrogen and adsorptive storage are evaluated, with an illustration of the pressure ranges in which adsorption facilitates storage of greater vols. of hydrogen than normal compression in the same operating conditions.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXpslKgtrw%253D&md5=142780d506b2317fe9d34c7515d88699", "37.
