There is growing concern that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are contributing to global climate change.  One very promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions is CO2 capture at a power plant, transport to an injection site, and sequestration for long-term storage in any of a variety of suitable geol. formations.  CO2 capture from coal-derived power generation can be achieved by various approaches: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-combustion.  All 3 of these pathways are under investigation, some at an early stage of development.  A wide variety of sepn. techniques is being pursued, including gas phase sepn., absorption into a liq., and adsorption on a solid, as well as hybrid processes, such as adsorption/membrane systems.

Its 3 D framework is built up of infinite trans chains of corner-sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra.  The chains are interconnected by the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate groups, creating 1 D rhombic-shaped tunnels.  Disordered 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid mols. are trapped inside these tunnels.  Their evacuation upon heating, between 275 and 420\u00b0, leads to a nanoporous open-framework (MIL-53ht (Al) or Al(OH)[O2CC6H4CO2]) with empty pores of diam. 8.5 \u00c5.  This solid exhibits a Langmuir surface area. of 1590(1) m2g-1 together with a remarkable thermal stability, since it starts to decomp. only at 500\u00b0.  At room temp., the solid reversibly absorbs H2O in its tunnels, causing a very large breathing effect and shrinkage of the pores.  Anal. of the hydration process by solid-state NMR (1H, 13C, 27Al) has clearly indicated that the trapped H2O mols. interact with the carboxylate groups through H bonds, but do not affect the hydroxyl species bridging the Al atoms.

Surprisingly, this structural transition shows a significant temp. hysteresis: the transition from the open-pored to closed-pored structure occurs at approx. 125 to 150 K, while the transition from the closed-pored to open-pored structure occurs around 325 to 375 K.

So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.

Microporous adsorbents are gaining ever increasing importance in industry.  Yet, we cannot reliably predict even the simplest case, binary gas adsorption, from pure component information.  Hence the need for data.  Recent improvements in instrumentation made available 'push-button' systems for measuring pure component isotherms.  Such systems do not exist for binary measurements which are at least an order of magnitude more complicated and time consuming.  Only a few research groups operate custom-made systems to collect binary gas adsorption data utilizing different techniques.  This paper reviews some of the most commonly used techniques.  Thermodn. relations provide an essential framework for the design of exptl. techniques, exptl. protocols, and for the anal. of data.  Similar to other exptl. methods, the accuracy of results is proportional to the complexity of measurements.  According to some counts, there are more models of multicomponent adsorption than accurate data to test them in literature.  If the expts. are not designed and performed carefully, the uncertainties of final results mushroom to unacceptable levels esp. for variables such as selectivity.  A complete error anal. for a typical system is shown.  The results with consideration to error anal. show that most data available in literature cannot be used to scrutinize between models.
