Commensurate adsorption of hydrocarbons occurs far more often in MMOFs than in zeolites and related materials, primarily as a result of a vastly greater variety of framework types and richer hierarchy of complexity of the pore structures for the former.

The three isophthalate moieties in TDPAT are linked through copper paddle-wheel units to form cuboctahedral supermol. building blocks, which are covalently bonded through the isophthalate moieties (at position 1) to yield a (3,24)-connected rht-type network.

The high adsorption affinity and capacity are attributed to the dual functionalization of the framework by concurrent incorporation of high d. of open metal sites and Lewis basic sites.

Presently investigated MOFs for MMMs include [Cu(SiF6)(4,4'-BIPY)2], [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3] (HKUST-1, Cu-BTC), [Cu(BDC)(DMF)], [Zn4O(BDC)3] (MOF-5), [Zn(2-methylimidazolate)2] (ZIF-8), [Zn(purinate)2] (ZIF-20), [Zn(2-carboxyaldehyde imidazolate)2] (ZIF-90), Mn(HCOO)2, [Al(BDC)(\u03bc-OH)] (MIL-53(Al)), [Al(NH2-BDC)(\u03bc-OH)] (NH2-MIL-53(Al)) and [Cr3O(BDC)3(F,OH)(H2O)2] (MIL-101) (4,4'-BIPY = 4,4'-bipyridine, BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate, BDC = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate, terephthalate).

Addnl. in most of the cases the permeability is increased for MMM membranes compared to the pure polymer.

However, the reported fluorescence sensory materials (e.g., polymers) usually respond to a class of analytes (e.g., nitroaroms.), rather than a single specific target.  Hence, the selective detection of trace amts. of trinitrotoluene (TNT) still remains a big challenge for fluorescence-based sensors.  Here the authors report the selective detection of TNT vapor using the nanoporous fibers fabricated by self-assembly of carbazole-based macrocyclic mols.  The nanoporosity allows for time-dependent diffusion of TNT mols. inside the material, resulting in further fluorescence quenching of the material after removal from the TNT vapor source.  Under the same testing conditions, other common nitroarom. explosives and oxidizing reagents did not demonstrate this postexposure fluorescence quenching; rather, a recovery of fluorescence was obsd.  The postexposure fluorescence quenching as well as the sensitivity is further enhanced by lowering the HOMO level of the nanofiber building blocks.  This in turn reduces the affinity for oxygen, thus allocating more interaction sites for TNT.  The authors' results present a simple and novel way to achieve detection selectivity for TNT by creating nanoporosity and tuning mol. electronic structure, which when combined may be applied to other fluorescence sensor materials for selective detection of vapor analytes.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XisVGht7c%253D&md5=16e5fdcbb1152ab421e977f3ba56eee0", "32.

While powder x-ray diffraction data show a high degree of crystallinity, the BET surface area of the nano-IRMOF-1 crystals of \u223c3000 m2/g demonstrates the large internal pore vol.  The nanocrystal growth mechanism under the assistance of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactant was studied by systematically changing the parameters of the prepn.  The influence of each step in the prepn. could be explained, and a rational synthesis protocol was thus obtained.  Thereby, this work provides access to much-desired but difficult to obtain high-quality nano-MOF crystals through an optimized and rational synthesis.
