Patients were advised to avoid lying on their backs for 10 days following surgery but no other posturing instructions were given.  Closure rates and improvement in visual acuity were compared with a group of historical controls in whom phacovitrectomy with gas tamponade and face down posturing was performed.  RESULTS:  Anatomical hole closure was noted in 18 of the 20 eyes (90%). 19 eyes (95%) showed an improvement of at least 0.3 logMAR units.  This compares favourably with the postured group in which anatomical hole closure was noted in 11 of 13 eyes (85%) and nine of 13 eyes (69%) showed an improvement of at least 0.3 logMAR units.

The permeation selectivity relies on subtle interplay between sorption and diffusion.  The required sorption isotherms for the pure components and mixts. are generated using configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations.  The CBMC simulations of the mixt. isotherm show a curious max. in the loading of 2-Me alkane; this loading decreases to almost zero with increased pressures.  The high sorption selectivity for the linear alkane is due to entropic effects; the linear alkane has a higher packing efficiency than the branched alkane within the zeolite structure.  Calcns. for a 50-50 mixt. of n-hexane (n-C6) and 2-methylpentane (2MP), for example, show that the higher sorption selectivity for the linear alkane has the effect of enhancing the flux of n-C6 through the silicalite membrane by up to a factor of 60 above that of 2MP.  Exptl. evidence to support the authors' new sepn. principle is provided by permeation data of Funke et al.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1cXlvFWlu78%253D&md5=bacf84af101f845ba733d3a258640aa5", " ", " ", "(25)", "\u2002", "Heyden, A.; D\u00fcren, T.; Keil, F.

At high loadings, a curious max. for equimolar gas-phase mixts. occurs with increasing pressure in the abs. adsorption isotherm of one or both adsorbing species.  It was detected that there exist two fundamentally different reasons for this max.  First, due to a higher packing efficiency, one component is able to displace the other component at high loadings.  Here, it must be stressed that the displaced component is not necessarily the larger mol.  Second, non-ideality effects of the bulk gas phase can be made responsible for this max.  The acceptance probability of a mol. insertion in a grand canonical Monte Carlo step is proportional to the component fugacity.  If, owing to non-ideality effects of the gas phase, the fugacity of one component does not increase as steeply with pressure as the other component, a max. can occur in the abs. adsorption isotherm of this component.

Sharp capillary condensation transitions are no longer obsd. due to the change in the filling mechanism.  The adsorption depends strongly on the location of the sites; by placing the sites at suitable sepns., cooperative \"bridging\" effects are brought into play and greatly enhance the amt. of water adsorbed.
