Surprisingly, the catalyst showed a gradual variation in the PXRD pattern when soaked in HCl solution, with faster conversion with increasing concentration. The PXRD patterns of MOF-5 after catalysis and soaking in HCl solution are identical, which clearly shows that the HCl byproduct released during the alkylation reactions initiates the transformation of MOF-5. It is important to mention that leaching processes during alkylation reactions will take place at higher rates, since the temperature conditions necessary for reaction to occur (170 \u00b0C) were significantly higher than RT. A more exhaustive attempt to collect single-crystal information about structural changes in MOF-5, by decreasing crystal exposure to water, consisted in exposing single crystals of MOF-5 to DMF solutions of HCl (0.2 M) for different times. Once again, it was not possible to obtain single-crystal data, since the crystals thus collected were either too small due to acid leaching or low diffracting.

In these experiments, we noticed similar conversions and selectivities with simultaneous transformation of these two MOFs to an unknown form. Efforts to get insight into the crystalline structure of the converted materials were also in vain due to the poor diffraction properties of the recovered crystals. Although it was confirmed that these catalysts undergo framework rearrangement during alkylation reaction due to the leaching processes occurring as HCl byproduct is formed, the significant catalytic performance in terms of product selectivity and conversion remained almost completely unchanged. To rule out the possibility that ZnO alone or H2-BDC is acting as the catalyst, the same Friedel\u2212Crafts alkylation of the toluene reaction was performed under identical conditions.

Some simple general principles concerning the design and construction of these frameworks are presented together with reasons for expecting them to show unusual and useful properties.  Two of the simplest conceivable systems of this type are isomorphous Zn(CN)2 and Cd(CN)2 whose structures were reexamd. by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, confirming the earlier description based on powder diffraction data of 2 interpenetrating diamond-related frameworks: cubic, space group P\u203e43m, Z = 2; with a 5.9002(9) \u00c5 (Zn(CN)2) and 6.301(1) \u00c5 (Cd(CN)2); 2 unique metal centers, 1 surrounded tetrahedrally by 4C and the other by 4N donors; MCNM rods linear; Zn-C 1.923(6), Zn-N 2.037(5), Cd-C 2.099(5), Cd-N 2.196(4), C-N 1.150(5) \u00c5 in Zn(CN)2, and 1.162(5) \u00c5 in Cd(CN)2.  The interpenetration of sep. frameworks demonstrated in these archetypal structures is likely to be a major concern in future studies of more complex scaffolding materials.  [N(CH3)4][CuZn(CN)4] was deliberately designed to demonstrate one conceivable way of preventing interpenetration; it is cubic, space group F\u203e43m, with A 11.609(3) \u00c5; Z = 4.  The structure contains a single diamond-related framework with alternating tetrahedral Cu(I) and Zn(II) centers and linear rods that are very likely of the type CuCNZn with bond distances Cu-C 1.877(8) and Zn-N 2.069(15) \u00c5, Z(CH3)4+ ions occupy half the adamantane cavities generated by the framework, the remaining cavities being vacant.  CuI[4,4',4'',4'''-tetracyanotetraphenylmethane]BF4\u00b7xC6H5NO2 (x \u2265 7.7) represents the first attempt to generate an infinite 3-dimensional framework with rods of some complexity.  It is tetragonal, space group I\u203e4m2, with a 13.620(2) and c 22.642(2) \u00c5; Z = 2.  The structure contains a diamond-related cationic framework with C\u00b7C6H4\u00b7CN\u00b7Cu rods of length 8.856(2) \u00c5.  The framework is tetragonally elongated along the c axis apparently as a result of nonbonded interactions between the 8 ortho-H atoms around the methane C centers.  There is no interpenetration.  The framework generates very large adamantane-like cavities occupied by disordered C6H5NO2 (at least 7.7 mols. per Cu) together with BF4- ions.  The crystals undergo ready anion exchange.  The material is unusual in that approx. two thirds by vol. of what is undoubtedly a crystal is effectively liq.
