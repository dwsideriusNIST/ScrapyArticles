The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been reported as 396.73 ppm in 2013 and it is expected to reach 550 ppm by 2050. Global warming is one of the environmental effects caused by increasing CO2 which is a dangerous threat for our planet. As a result, research on the new materials and methods for reducing the amount of CO2 has attracted scientists\u2019 attention [1].One of the most popular technologies for capturing CO2 was based on absorption by alkanolamine such as monoethanolamine (MEA) which has been employed industrially for over 50 years [2], however sensitivity of this solvent to chemical degradation caused to produce impurities such as SOx and NOx in gas streams. Therefore, the efficiencies of these adsorbents reduced. There are other adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbon, which are solid ones [3, 4]. Zeolites especially zeolite 13X, are amongst the most widely physical adsorbents that have been investigated. Zeolites are employed at pressures above 2 bar and their capacity reduced greatly by the presence of moisture [3].Among CO2 adsorbents have been investigated so far, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted scientists\u2019 attention due to their unique properties for this purpose. MOFs are a class of porous materials which are formed from metal ions or metal clusters as nodes and organic ligands as linkers [5, 6, 7]. Several structures with different pore size and morphology can be synthesized by using variety of linkers [5, 6, 7]. According to their high surface area and tunable pore size, they are applied as gas storage [8, 9], sensors [10, 11], catalyst [12, 13, 14], drug delivery systems [15] and adsorbent [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].In Cu(BDC), terephthalate ligands (BDC) are coordinated in a bidentate bridging model to a CuII dimer, separated vertically by 2.63 \u00c5. Each CuII atom is coordinated to a molecule of DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) to give a square-pyramidal coordination geometry. In this structure the CuII atoms are coordinated to the BDC linkers in the (201) planes. These sheets are bonded through weak stacking interactions [25]. Mori et al. synthesized Cu(BDC) crystal by evaporation method for the first time. They obtained plate like microcrystals and investigated the adsorption of N2, O2 and Ar gases on them [26]. After that, Carson and his coworkers reported the synthesis of Cu(BDC) via solvothermal method. They used DMF as solvent and studied the effects of other solvents on the structure and XRD patterns of synthesized samples [25].Most of the MOFs have been synthesized by hydrothermal/solvothermal heating methods which need high temperatures and long times about 1\u20137 days based on the kind of MOF. However the other synthesis method such as microwave assisted, electrochemical, mechanochemical and ultrasonic methods are attracted scientific attentions due to their special properties. Beyond mentioned synthesis methods, microwave assisted is more remarkable due to reducing reaction time and formation of MOFs with higher crystallinity and phase purity. Sanil et al. [27], synthesized [Cu(BTC), BTC: 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate] by microwave hydrothermal method. Their synthesis method led to formation of CU(BTC) MOF with nanometer size and good crystallinity. Liang et al. [28] synthesized Zirconium oxide based MOF using rapid microwave assisted solvothermal method that produce purer phases and higher quality crystalline products in significantly less time than the conventional heating method.In this paper, we use just microwave heating as the individual source of energy for simple and fast synthesizing Cu(BDC) which accelerate reactions as a consequence of intense localized heating and reducing reaction time [29, 30, 31, 32]. Furthermore, the effects of irradiation time and microwave power on the crystallinity and surface area of the samples were investigated closely. Due to our knowledge the synthesis of Cu(BDC) by simple microwave method have not been reported. Herein, We present rapid, facile and one pot synthesis of Cu(BDC) with available and inexpensive ligand. The obtained Cu(BDC) MOF, is more cubic shaped with smaller size and narrower size distribution (3\u201310 \u00b5m) compared with Cu(BDC) which was synthesized via solvothermal and evaporation methods. Also, we investigate its adsorption capacity and its selectivity for CO2 and CH4 gases.2 Experimental2.1 Materials and methodsCopper(II) nitrate trihydrate (pure) and N,N-dimethylformamide (99.8 %) were purchased from Merck Co. Terephthalicacid (H2BDC; 98 %) was provided by sigma-Aldrich Co. All of the mentioned materials were used without further purification. XRD patterns were obtained on JEOL JDX-8030 X-ray diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained on a Micromeritics Asap 2020 at sorptometer at liquid nitrogen temperature. The specific surface areas of samples were calculated by Langmuir method. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Shimadzu, KBr pellet technique was used to identify the functional groups of the samples in the range of 400\u20134000 cm\u22121. The morphology of prepared samples was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM, Hitachi Japan, S4160. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a TA Instrument 931.2.2 Copper terephthalate metal organic framework (Cu(BDC)) synthesisA mixture of Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O, H2BDC (benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid) and DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) were stirred about 30 min to get a clear solution. The mixture was then transferred into a domestic microwave and heating about 30\u201390 min at 300 and 100 W irradiation powers, respectively. The blue greenish precipitate was obtained, filtered and washed with DMF for several times. Then the prepared samples were dried in an oven for 10 h at 220 \u00b0C. The concentrations of reactants and the conditions of synthesis for four prepared samples are indicated in Table 1; they are named as samples 1, 2, 3 and 4 after here. Sample 4 was synthesized three times in order to investigate reproducibility of Cu(BDC) synthesis by microwave method, data have been given in supplementary data.Table 1 The concentrations of reactants, irradiationtime and power for prepared samples  Samples  DMF (mL)  Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O (mmol)  H2BDC (mmol)  Microwave power (W)  Irradiation time (min)  Sample 1  87  4  4  300  30  Sample 2  60  2  2  100  90  Sample 3  87  4  4  100  90  Sample 4  60  2  2  300  30  2.3 Gas adsorption measurementsThe adsorption measurements were carried on a volumetric apparatus with a pressure transducer BD Sensors (0\u201360 bar) with 0.5 % FS (full scale) accuracy equipped by a vacuum system (Fig. 1). The temperature was adjusted with a water bath Tu-20D Tempunit with accuracy of 0.1 \u00b0C at 303 K. In order to measure the adsorption capacity, 1 g of each sample was placed in adsorption cell and was activated at 363 K under 0.01 absolute bar for at least 3 h. Before injection the pure gases to the system, the void volume of the set up should be measured by entering He gas. Helium as a non-adsorbed gas was used for this purpose. The details of computing the void volumes are reported elsewhere [33]. Peng\u2013Robinson equation was used for measuring the adsorbent capacity [34]. Open image in new window Fig. 1 Scheme of volumetric system for measuring pure gas adsorption on adsorbent  3 Results and discussionThe crystal structure and phase purity of samples were characterized by XRD. X-ray diffraction patterns of samples 1\u20134 are shown in Fig. 2. All the characteristic peaks of samples match well with the XRD patterns, which have been reported before for Cu(BDC). These peaks are characterized by peaks at 2\u03b8 = 8.3\u00b0 and 9.1\u00b0 representing (001) and (020) planes of crystal structure, respectively [25, 31] and confirm that the MOF was synthesized successfully under microwave radiation. Also, no other phases are characterized beside Cu(BDC) which is due to its purity. The intensity of peaks in sample 4, is higher than that of other samples, which reveals its better crystallinity. These sharp peaks, demonstrate that the irradiation power and time of microwave, also the concentration of reactants were proper for synthesis of Cu(BDC) with high crystallinity and purity, the XRD patterns of sample 4 which has synthesized for three times, were still consistent with the as synthesized one, indicating reproducibility of synthesize method (Fig. S1). In samples 1 and 3, the characteristic peak at 2\u03b8 = 8.23\u00b0 is a single one compared to samples 2 and 4 which indicate separated peaks at mentioned 2\u03b8 that explains existence of solvents molecules in the crystal structure of these samples. In mentioned samples the concentrations of reactants are higher than that in samples 4 and 2 which demonstrate the importance of this factor in the crystal structure of Cu(BDC). It seems that in samples 1 and 3 more solvent molecules are coordinated to the crystal structure which makes the elimination of solvent more difficult. Open image in new window Fig. 2 XRD patterns of samples a sample 1, b sample 2, c sample 3 and d sample 4  Figure 3 shows the IR spectra of the samples. The observed band at 1699 cm\u22121 is assigned to the C-O stretching mode of free carboxylic acid groups. The sharp bands at 1566 and 1394 cm\u22121 are attributed to COO asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of coordinated carboxylic acid groups, respectively. The bands at 1512 and 740 cm\u22121 belong to the vibrations of phenyl ring. The peak at 640 cm\u22121 is related to the planar angle bending of OCN group, which means that some solvent molecules may remain in the structure [25, 35]. The mentioned peak is observed in samples 1 and 3 and which is in agreement with the XRD patterns of these samples. To prove the existence of solvent molecules in samples 1 and 3 the elemental analysis was also performed for all samples; Sample 1; C: 32.13 %, H: 1.41 %, N: 0.72 %, Sample 2; C: 40.71 %, H: 1.72 %, N: 0 %, Sample 3; C: 30.3 %, H: 1.32 %, N: 0.91 % and Sample 4; C: 40.36 %, H: 1.73 %, N = 0 %. Open image in new window Fig. 3 IR spectra of samples 1\u20134  The aforementioned results indicated the presence of nitrogen element in samples 1 and 3, which is referred to solvent molecule, N,N-dimethylformamide, proving the XRD and IR data.The SEM images of the prepared samples are shown in Fig. 4. SEM images were used for determining the morphology and size distribution of the samples. As it is observed, samples 4 and 1 have uniform particles with cubic morphology which are in agreement with their XRD patterns. The presences of high intensity peaks in these patterns confirm their high crystallinity. Their edge dimensions are about 10 \u00b5m due to SEM images. It is obvious that the irradiation time and power have supplied appropriate conditions (Table 1) for homogenous nucleation and crystallization of these samples. The SEM image of sample 2 shows the existence of nanosheets. In this sample the cubic sheets just grow in two dimensions and the cubic structure is not observed because of the lack of irradiation power, this is the ideal situation for synthesizing nano sheets of Cu(BDC) instead of its cubic structure, with relatively high surface area compared with other report [25]. Herein, we present the more facile synthesize procedure for gaining nano sheet structure of Cu(BDC) MOF. In the SEM image of sample 3 some incomplete crystals are observed which could not be considered as impurity related to the XRD pattern, however it is due to high reactants concentration and lack of irradiation power and time, which lead to formation of incomplete crystals. Open image in new window Fig. 4 SEM images of a sample 1, b sample 2, c sample 3 and d sample 4 and the curve of size distribution of each sample  The result of thermo-gravimetric analysis of sample 4 is shown in Fig. 5. The TG analysis of sample 4 as the best sample is studied, according to the results of analysis. The first decrease which is started at 190 \u00b0C and ended at 240 \u00b0C is related to removal of solvent molecules in the structure. The second step is started at 310 \u00b0C corresponding to the decomposition of the MOF and collapsing its crystal structure [26]. Open image in new window Fig. 5 TGA curve of sample 4  The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of samples 1\u20134 at 77 K are illustrated in Fig. 6 and reveale the isotherm type I with H2 hysteresis, which is related to microporous materials [34]. The observed hysteresis in the isotherms has been originated from shifting desorption isotherm in respect of adsorption isotherms. This shifted numbers are also indicated in this figure. The specific surface areas, pore volumes and sizes are revealed in Table 2. The Langmuir surface area of sample 4 is 624 m2/g that is lower than 708 m2/g for the Cu(BDC) sample which was synthesized by solvothermal method [36]. According to size distribution of pores, some mesopores are appeared along microporoes in the MOF structure which are the result of fast nucleation and crystallization that lead to decrease surface area. According to t-plot results, in sample 2 the micropores are more than that in sample 4, which is a result of irradiation time and power lead to synthesizing uniform micropores with low defect. However the Langmuir surface area of mentioned sample is 611 m2/g which has negligible difference to 624 m2/g in sample 4. In sample 4, the formed voids between sheets increase the surface area of this sample compared to sample 2. The hysteresis effect in adsorption\u2013desorption curves is due to the inter connectivity of pores which proves defects in the structure. In this system, the internal pores are connected to the external vapor phase via a smaller pore, in many cases a smaller pore acts as a neck to main pores. Therefore, desorption happens with different mechanism than adsorption called percolation and cavitation [36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. It seems that fast nucleation of Cu(BDC) via microwave heating might causes irregularity in pore size and pore shapes which lead to appearance of some mesopores in the structure according to the pore size. The pore size of samples 2 and 3 are smaller than that in samples 1 and 4, but the Langmuir surface area of sample 3 is much lower than sample 4 which caused by trapped solvents molecule in its structure according to its IR spectra and elemental analysis. According to the XRD pattern, IR spectrum and elemental analysis of sample 1, the occupying pores by solvents molecules lead to low surface area. The nonhomogenity occurred in the surface atoms and pore structure of the MOF arise different sites with different potential energy for adsorption of polar and nonpolar components.

Shifted numbers are mentioned in each isotherm  Table 2 Langmuir surface area, pore volume and pore size of the samples  Sample  Langmuir (m2/g)  Pore size (nm)  Pore volume (cm3/g)  Micropore volume (cm3/g)  t-plot micropore area (m2/g)  1  430  2.40  0.240  0.129  332  2  611  1.85  0.264  0.193  499  3  390  1.86  0.164  0.118  307  4  624  2.14  0.262  0.190  430  3.1 Adsorption equilibriumAs shown in Fig. 7, the isotherms of adsorbed amounts of CO2 and CH4 are sketched versus equilibrium gas pressure. The vacant coordination sites in Cu(BDC) which are appeared after removal of solvent molecules can be used to storage the gas molecules. This figure shows that the capacity for adsorbing CO2 is higher than CH4 and it is referred to the quadrapolar property of CO2 and its more tendency than that of CH4 to the surface adsorption. Besides that, the kinetic diameter of CO2 is 0.33 nm which is smaller than CH4 (0.38 nm) and this difference makes faster penetration of CO2 molecules inside the channels and micropores of MOF. The adsorption of CO2 molecules is 10.4 mmol/g at 47.7 bar and 313 K which is higher than CH4 molecules (5.2 mmol/g at the same pressure and temperature). According to BET results the adsorption of CO2 and CH4 on sample 2 is studied in addition. Assigned to Fig. 7 the adsorption of the mentioned gases are lower than that in sample 4. According to pore size, the micropores in this sample are so small that they prevent the diffusion of gases molecules, especially CH4 with higher kinetic diameter and the adsorbed CO2 molecules are the result of their interaction as quadropole molecule with Cu(BDC) surface. Based on the results, the sample 2 is not proper as an adsorbent compared to sample 4, however it may have other applications due to its sheet like morphology and high surface area. Open image in new window Fig. 7 The adsorption isotherms of CH4 and CO2 on sample 4 and the best fitted curves  Adsorption selectivity of CO2 over CH4 in sample 4 was calculated using Eq. 1 at each equilibrium pressure. The resulted curve is illustrated in Fig. 8. These results demonstrate that Cu(BDC) have enough potential for separating CO2 from CH4 at lower pressures. According to this curve, the best pressure for this purpose is 1.38 bar in which the selectivity of adsorbing CO2 against CH4 is 6. At low pressures, CO2 molecules are adsorbed on adsorbent due to their quadropole moment and their interaction with charged atoms on the adsorbent, however CH4 molecules are nonpolar and they can\u2019t adsorbed significantly. But by increasing pressure, CH4 molecules penetrate into the channels of adsorbent and occupy them that cause reduction of selectivity.$$selectivity\\left( {\\frac{{CO_{2} }}{{CH_{4} }}} \\right) = \\left[ {\\frac{{\\left( {c_{{\\upmu iCO_{2} }}^{n} /P_{{eqiCO_{2} }} } \\right)}}{{\\left( {c_{{\\upmu i CH_{4} }}^{n} /P_{{eqiCH_{4} }} } \\right)}}} \\right]$$ (1)where, \\(c_{\\upmu i}^{n}\\) and \\(P_{eqi}\\) are mmol/g fraction of adsorbed gas molecules and the equilibrium pressure, respectively. Open image in new window Fig. 8 Selectivity of CO2 against CH4 at 303 K and various equilibrium pressures  Several isotherm models were correlated on the equilibrium adsorption experiments of CO2 and CH4, and their parameters were predicted by non-linear regression analysis, using MATLAB numerical software. To approach to the optimal parameters, an objective function was defined on the base of relative deviation between model and experimental points introduced by Marquardt\u2019s percent standard deviation with Eq. 2. Direct search method with Nelder\u2013Mead numerical algorithm was employed to minimize the objective function and predict the optimal parameters of each model [41].$$MPSD = 100\\sqrt{\\left[\\right.\\frac{1}{n - p}} \\,\\sum {\\left( \\left.{\\frac{{q_{e,meas} - q_{e,calc} }}{{q_{e,meas} }}} \\right)^{2} \\right]}$$ (2) The isotherms and the calculated optimal parameters with their deviations are reported in Table 3. According to the lowest MPSD among the models, the best models for CO2 and CH4 adsorption would be proposed. As can be seen in Table 3, Sips and Toth models are chosen for CO2 adsorption as the best fitted isotherms according to lower MPSD rather than the other models. Both of these models correspond to the monolayer and heterogeneous adsorption systems. For CH4 adsorption, Freundlich and BET equations can be chosen as the best fitted models on the base of the lowest MPSD. However BET equation is typically proposed for multilayer adsorption systems and it can be said that adsorption of CH4 at lower pressures is not significant but at higher pressures CH4 can enter through the connected channels and occupy the pores of the MOF. However due to the low interaction of CH4 molecules with each other according to its non-polar properties, the multilayer adsorption can occur only in very high pressures [42], therefore the BET model for CH4 adsorption can be accepted in high pressures. Freundlich equation is used for mono or multilayer adsorption, with non-uniform distribution of adsorption enthalpy and affinities over the heterogeneous surface [41].Table 3 The parameters of Langmuir, Freundlich, BET, Sips, Toth, DR and DA equations and errors as calculated for sample 4  Model  CO2   CH4   Langmuir  \\(C_{\\upmu } = \\frac{{C_{\\upmu s } bp}}{1 + bp}\\)   C\u00b5s = 14.65 \u00b1 1.68  C\u00b5s = 25.77 \u00b1 9.2   \\(R_{adj}^{2*} = 0.9910\\)    \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9987\\)   MPSD = 14.0665  MPSD = 8.7036  Freundlich  \\(C_{\\upmu } = KP^{{{\\raise0.7ex\\hbox{$1$} \\!\\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {1 n}}\\right.\\kern-0pt} \\!\\lower0.7ex\\hbox{$n$}}}}\\)   K = 1.41 \u00b1 0.16  K = 0.1807 \u00b1 0.0114  n = 1.913 \u00b1 0.12  n = 1.15 \u00b1 0.023   \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9969\\)    \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9996\\)   MPSD = 9.2603  MPSD = 1.7339  Sips  \\(C_{\\upmu } = C_{\\upmu s} \\frac{{\\left( {bP} \\right)^{{{\\raise0.7ex\\hbox{$1$} \\!\\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {1 n}}\\right.\\kern-0pt} \\!\\lower0.7ex\\hbox{$n$}}}} }}{{1 + \\left( {bP} \\right)^{{{\\raise0.7ex\\hbox{$1$} \\!\\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {1 n}}\\right.\\kern-0pt} \\!\\lower0.7ex\\hbox{$n$}}}} }}\\)   C\u00b5s = 28.18 \u00b1 6.77  C\u00b5s = 580.5 \u00b1 10189.5  b = 0.009697 \u00b1 0.005864  b = 0.00009615 \u00b1 0.00199285  n = 1.464 \u00b1 0.113  n = 1.144 \u00b1 0.107   \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9996\\)    \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9992\\)   MPSD = 1.8833  MPSD = 2.1674  Toth  \\(C_{\\upmu } = C_{\\upmu s} \\frac{bP}{{\\left( {1 + \\left( {bP} \\right)^{t} } \\right)^{{{\\raise0.7ex\\hbox{$1$} \\!\\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {1 t}}\\right.\\kern-0pt} \\!\\lower0.7ex\\hbox{$t$}}}} }}\\)   C\u00b5s = 77.04 \u00b1 58.12  C\u00b5s = 1991 \u00b1 34149  b = 0.04408 \u00b1 0.000712  b = 0.00009394 \u00b1 0.00150206  t = 0.2954 \u00b1 0.0905  t = 0.3123 \u00b1 0.8227   \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9997\\)    \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9992\\)   MPSD = 0.9689  MPSD = 5.0944  BET  \\(C_{\\upmu } = \\frac{{C_{\\upmu s} C_{BET} P}}{{\\left( {P_{0} - P} \\right)\\left[ {1 + \\left( {C_{BET} - 1} \\right)\\left( {\\frac{P}{{P_{0} }}} \\right)} \\right]}}\\)   CBET = 18.25 \u00b1 2.67  CBET = 4.653 \u00b1 0.207  P0 = 167.9 \u00b1 56.2  P0 = 125.8 \u00b1 8.2  C\u03bcs = 8.595 \u00b1 1.469  C\u03bcs = 4.406 \u00b1 0.326   \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9976\\)    \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9999\\)   MPSD = 7.0366  MPSD = 1.7809  Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich (DR)  \\(C_{\\upmu } = C_{\\upmu s} \\exp \\left[ { - \\frac{{RTLn(P_{0} /P)}}{E}} \\right]^{2}\\)    C \u03bcs = 11.2 \u00b1 0.82   C \u03bcs = 6.08 \u00b1 0.794  E = 6836 \u00b1 637  E = 4841 \u00b1 605   \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9698\\)    \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9728\\)   MPSD = 23.7987  MPSD = 34.25308  Dubinin\u2013Astakhov (DA)  \\(C_{\\upmu } = C_{\\upmu s} \\exp \\left[ { - \\frac{{RTLn(P_{0} /P)}}{E}} \\right]^{n}\\)    C \u03bcs = 14.08 \u00b1 0.71   C \u03bcs = 12.54 \u00b1 1.40  E = 5806 \u00b1 270  E = 2593 \u00b1 312   N = 1.279 \u00b1 0.094  N = 0.9238 \u00b1 0.0729   \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9997\\)    \\(R_{adj}^{2} = 0.9998\\)   MPSD = 1.9507  MPSD = 2.6993   \\(R_{adj}^{2*} = 1 - \\frac{{(1 - R^{2} )\\,(N - 1)}}{N - p - 1}\\)   Heterogeneity of the MOF surface could be arisen from different active sites and charges on the Cu(BDC) surface. Copper atoms with positive charges and oxygen atoms with negative charges occurred from COO\u2212 groups and their interactions with quadropole moment of CO2 differ from each other, therefore heat of adsorption would be different from each other. So the interaction between molecules and surface sites occurs with different energetic sites. At lower pressures, CO2 is expected to adsorb on the atoms or functional groups by the interaction between quadropolar moments and at high pressures, the interaction between molecules is reason for further adsorption inside the pores. According to the results, and existence of Cu centers and \u2013COO\u2212 functional groups, it is expected to expose to a heterogeneous surface coverage inside the prepared Cu(BDC) MOF during surface adsorption of CO2 and CH4.4 ConclusionsCu(BDC) as a metalorganic framework was synthesized by a fast and facile method using domestic microwave without using other source of energy. Influence of concentration of source materials, microwave power and time of irradiation were investigated on the quality of the prepared MOF. Appropriate concentration of source reactants under high microwave power during short time received Cu(BDC) MOF material with cubic crystal shape and high Langmuir surface area, and the property of the prepared product was comparable with those samples synthesized by the time consuming solvothermal method. By using microwave method instead of solvothermal method, smaller crystals were obtained in the range of 6\u201310 \u00b5m. The adsorption capacity of the sample with the highest Langmuir surface area (624 m2/g) was determined for adsorbing CO2 and CH4 in a broad range of pressure and normal temperature, and it was resulted that selectivity of the MOF toward CO2 was about sixfold higher than CH4. It is concluded that the prepared MOF can be used as an adsorbent for separation of CO2 from CH4 especially at lower pressures. In addition because of having high adsorption capacity, this MOF can be used for storage of CO2 from the tail gas. The resulted isotherms were fitted on several adsorption isotherm models for both CO2 and CH4 and due to minimization of the relative error between the experiments and model the parameters of each model were predicted. Among the models, Toth and Sips models can better interpret the data of CO2 adsorption and Freundlich or BET model reveal better correlation to the CH4 adsorption isotherm.", "title": "Facile and fast, one pot microwave synthesis of metal organic framework copper terephthalate and study CO and CH adsorption on it", "authors": ["Nesa Esmaeilian Tari", "Azadeh Tadjarodi", "Javad Tamnanloo", "Shohreh Fatemi"], "doi": ["https://doi.org/10.1007/s10934-015-9992-y"], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO1\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig1_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig1_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO2\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig2_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig2_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO3\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig3_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig3_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO4\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig4_HTML.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig4_HTML.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO5\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig5_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig5_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO6\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig6_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig6_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO7\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig7_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig7_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO9\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig8_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-9992-y/MediaObjects/10934_2015_9992_Fig8_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>"]}
