These compounds have attracted attention because of their large pore size, high surface area, and thermal, magnetic, optical and catalytic properties [", "1", ", ", "2", ", ", "3", ", ", "4", "]. According to the pore size, the porous materials are classified into: microporous (pore diameter 0.2\u20132.0\u00a0nm), mesoporous (pore diameter 2.0\u201350.0\u00a0nm) and macroporous (pore sizes exceeding 50.0\u00a0nm). Microporous and macroporous materials are widely used as adsorbents [", "5", "]. Coordination polymers or metal-organic frameworks are polymeric materials with frameworks formed from organic bridging ligands and metal ions, and these compounds have unique features [", "6", ", ", "7", ", ", "8", "]. One of the most important features of MOFs is the ability to tailor the material\u2019s properties by appropriate choice of the staring materials [", "9", "]. The most important part in the design of the metal-organic frameworks is the organic linker. The linkers are organic polyfunctional ligands that coordinate with multiple metal centers forming one-, two- or three-dimensional polymeric structures [", "10", "]. Unique functionalities have been found in metal-organic frameworks, in particular the porous properties of these compounds. Much attention has been attracted to the porous MOFs because of their importance in creation of nanometer-sized pore size, the discovery of new phenomena and their commercial applications in heterogeneous catalysis, as well as separation and storage of gases [", "11", ", ", "12", "].", "In this work, we prepared four new mononuclear and hetero-binuclear MOFs derived from the reaction of 1,4-bis[(3,5-dimethyl)pyrazole-4-yl]benzene (H", "2", "DPB) with zinc nitrate or mixture of zinc and cobalt nitrates by solvothermal method from dimethylformamide (DMF) or ethanol.
