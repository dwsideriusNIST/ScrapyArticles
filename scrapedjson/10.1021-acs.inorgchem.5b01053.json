For the MOFs prepared using the hydrochloric acid modulator, the missing linker defects, if present, are assumed to be capped by the \u2212OH units, and they are difficult to quantify directly. In this case, organic acid treatment was found to be very useful, since defect content may then be determined by the organic acid uptake.

The reverse process is also possible, as observed in the hydrolytic removal of the acetates from UiO-67", "a", " by treatment with diluted hydrochloric acid. In addition to defect quantification purposes, the method could serve as a straightforward approach for the introduction of new functional substituents into Zr-MOFs. Thus, the formic acid treatment of UiO-66", "b", " led to the benzoate being replaced with lighter formate, leading to the predicted increase in both the nitrogen uptake (see ", "Figure S4", " in the Supporting Information) and the SA (1600 m", "2", "/g, the highest among the UiO-66 samples studied here).

This phenomenon is interpreted as showing that the linker diacid had been incorporated by bonding through only one of the carboxylate groups, which would make them labile for subsequent exchange.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions/clusters coordinated by org. linkers (or bridging-ligands).  The hallmark of MOFs is their permanent porosity, which is frequently found in MOFs constructed from metal-clusters.  These clusters are often formed in situ, whereas the linkers are generally pre-formed.  The geometry and connectivity of a linker dictate the structure of the resulting MOF.  Adjustments of linker geometry, length, ratio, and functional-group can tune the size, shape, and internal surface property of a MOF for a targeted application.  In this crit. review, the authors highlight advances in MOF synthesis focusing on linker design.  Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, mol. recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described.  Further search for application-oriented MOFs through judicious selection of metal clusters and org. linkers is desirable.  In this review, linkers are categorized as ditopic (Section 1), tritopic (Section 2), tetratopic (Section 3), hexatopic (Section 4), octatopic (Section 5), mixed (Section 6), desymmetrized (Section 7), metallo (Section 8), and N-heterocyclic linkers (Section 9).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXht1Slu7jK&md5=322785c0256204742e3e95e5d2d49914", "(b) ", "Chen", ", ", "T.-H.", "; ", "Popov", ", ", "I.", "; ", "Kaveevivitchai", ", ", "W.", "; ", "Miljani\u0107", ", ", "O. \u0160.", " ", "Chem.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are modular porous materials synthesized from metal cluster nodes and org. linkers that connect these nodes.  This rapidly expanding class of structures presents viable platforms for applications in gas sorption and sepn., catalysis, sensing, fuel processing, and environmental remediation and as porous conductive materials.  These applications are increasingly relying on sophisticated ligands that have functional characteristics either as independent entities (i.e., outside of MOFs) or that gain new functions once reticulated into the porous material.  Thus, the traditionally inorg. area of MOF research begins to profit more and more from a comprehensive approach which combines insights from org., inorg., and materials chem.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "3.

Herein we report the construction of two highly stable MOFs (1 and 2) using elongated dicarboxylate bridging ligands derived from Cp*Ir(L)Cl complexes (L = dibenzoate-substituted 2,2'-bipyridine, bpy-dc, or dibenzoate-substituted 2-phenylpyridine, ppy-dc) and Zr6O4(OH)4(carboxylate)12 cuboctahedral secondary building units (SBUs) and the elucidation of water oxidn. pathways of the Cp*Ir(L)Cl catalysts using these MOFs.

Following a background introduction about catalytic relevance to various metal-org. materials, crystal engineering of MOFs, characterization and evaluation methods of MOF catalysis, the authors categorize catalytic MOFs based on the types of active sites, including coordinatively unsatd. metal sites (CUMs), metallo-ligands, functional org. sites (FOS), as well as metal nanoparticles (MNPs) embedded in the cavities.  The authors emphasize the incidental or deliberate formation of active sites, the stability, heterogeneity, and shape/size selectivity for MOF catalysis.

Among the MOFs were 10 zirconium(IV) MOFs with a subset of these, MOF-801-SC (single crystal form), -802, -805, -806, -808, -812, and -841 reported for the first time.  MOF-801-P (microcryst. powder form) was reported earlier and studied here for its water adsorption properties.  MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized but not examd. for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of MOF-841 synthesis.

In addn., the rate-detg. step of the condensation is suggested to be the C-C bond formation.  Our findings indicate the involvement of two catalyst mols. in the C-C bond formation of the aldol condensation, presumably by the activation of both the aldol acceptor and donor in a Mannich-type pathway.  This mechanism is shown to be operative also in the oligomerization of acetaldehyde with high proline amts., for which the first in situ detection of a proline-derived dienamine was accomplished.  In addn., the diastereoselectivity of the aldol addn. is evidenced to be time-dependent since it is undermined by the retro-aldolization and the competing irreversible aldol condensation; here NMR reaction profiles can be used as a tool for reaction optimization.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXjvV2gtrY%253D&md5=dcacf15e4b6148f5ea4d69a50dc8949e", "(b) ", "Hayashi", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Samanta", ", ", "S.", "; ", "Itoh", ", ", "T.", "; ", "Ishikawa", ", ", "H.", " ", "Org.
