However, so far this potential remains underexplored. Existing materials design methods developed from heavier and higher-valent elements, while extensible to other elements of the same (and perhaps higher) oxidation states are of limited value to the lithium system. To address the unique structural chemistry of monovalent lithium ion, we previously reported a method based on charge-complementary neutral and mononegative N-donor ligands in an effort to mimic ZIF-like frameworks containing monomeric lithium nodes.

As is well known, between a single Li node and polymeric Li\u2013O chains and layers, there is also a rich chemistry of Li clusters.

Such neutral\u2013neutral connectivity generally results in frameworks whose stability is lower than those constructed from charged building units, for example, negative carboxylate ligands and positive inorganic clusters.", "It is therefore desirable to have a strategy to address the twin goals of the strengthening the cluster-ligand linkages while still being able to take advantage of rich chemistry of lithium-aryloxide-type clusters. One family of ligands that could make it possible to accomplish both goals are those integrating pyridal and phenol functionalities. The simplest ligand in this family is 4-hydroxypyridine (HOPy).

Three-dimensional Li+inic- frameworks contg. solvent-filled channels are present in all of these except for the MeOH and EtOH solvates.  The nondirectional character of the electrostatic interactions between the Li+ and inic- ions bestows an element of plasticity upon the framework, manifested in the observation of no less than five different framework structures within the family.  Unusual single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations accompany desolvation of Li+inic-\u00b7S in which the Li+inic- framework undergoes a major rearrangement (from a structure contg. 8484 chains to one with 6666 chains).  The before and after structures are strongly suggestive of the mechanism and the driving force for these solid state framework rearrangements: processes which further demonstrate the plasticity of the ionic Li(inic) framework.  A solid-state mechanism for these desolvation processes that accounts very satisfactorily for the formation of the channels and for the diverse geometrical/topol. aspects of the transformation is proposed.  The reverse process allows the regeneration of the solvated 8484 form.  When the 6666 Li+inic- form is immersed in carbon disulfide, a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation occurs to generate Li+inic-\u00b70.25CS2.  The hydrate, Li+inic-\u00b72H2O which consists of discrete Li(inic)\u00b7H2O chains obtained by recrystg. the salt from water, can also be obtained by hydration of the 6666 form.

In the presence of THF, the OPh deriv. was previously identified as the hexagonal prismatic complex [Li(OPh)(THF)]6; however, the structure isolated from the above route proved to be tetranuclear [Li(OPh)(THF)]4 (1).  The other Li(OAr)(THF)x products isolated were characterized by single-crystal x-ray diffraction as [Li(OAr)(THF)]4 [OAr = oMP (2), DMP (3), oPP (4)], [Li(DIP)(THF)]3 (5), [Li(oBP)(THF)2]2, (6), and [Li(DBP)(THF)]2, (7).  The tetranuclear species (1-4) consist of sym. cubes of alternating tetrahedral Li and pyramidal O atoms, with terminal THF solvent mols. bound to each metal center.  The trinuclear species 5 consists of a six-membered ring of alternating trigonal planar Li and bridging O atoms, with one THF solvent mol. bound to each metal center.  Compd. 6 possesses two Li atoms that adopt tetrahedral geometries involving two bridging oBP and two terminal THF ligands.  The structure of 7 was identical to the previously reported [Li(DBP)(THF)]2 species, but different unit cell parameters were obsd.  Compd. 7 varies from 6 in that only one solvent mol. is bound to each Li metal center of 7 because of the steric bulk of the DBP ligand.  In contrast to the structurally diverse THF adducts, when py was used as the solvent, the appropriate Li(OAr)(py)x complexes were isolated as [Li(OAr)(py)2]2 (OAr = OPh (8), oMP (9), DMP (10), oPP (11), DIP (12), oBP (13)) and [Li(DBP)(py)]2 (14).  Compds. 8-13 adopt a dinuclear, edge-shared tetrahedral complex geometry.  For 14, because of the steric crowding of the DBP ligand, only one py is coordinated, yielding a dinuclear fused trigonal planar arrangement.  Two addnl. structure types were also characterized for the DIP ligand: [Li(DIP)(H-DIP)(py)]2 (12b) and [Li2(DIP)2(py)3] (12c).  Multinuclear (6,7Li and 13C) solid-state MAS NMR spectroscopic studies indicate that the bulk powder possesses several Li environments for transitional ligands of the THF complexes; however, the py adducts possess only one Li environment, which is consistent with the solid-state structures.  Soln.

Its structure is constructed from 1-dimensional metal phosphate 4MR columns with a high Zn to P ratio, and 1-dimensional supramol. chains formed of btec and Hbpy units.  The structural topol. differs from the pillared-layer type commonly adopted by amine-incorporated OMPOs.  Unlike MOFs which can be prepd. with a wide choice of org. carboxylates, few OMPOs were synthesized with aryl carboxylates.  One of the key factors for the formation of this functional OMPO appears to be the synergistic effect of the org. ligands btec and Hbpy in that they are strongly hydrogen bonded to each other.  This hydrogen bonding also explains why btec is two-connected to Zn centers instead of the typical four-connected pattern.  Another factor is a solvent effect, in that DMF was indispensable to create a structure with pyridine and carboxylate coexisting as ligands.  Without DMF, a different structure would otherwise result in which bpy acts as template only.  Added to the novelty of the NTHU-8 structure is the gas sorption properties, which are superior to conventional inorg. metal phosphate materials.  NTHU-8 is has both micropores and mesopores, indicating that bimodal pore-size distributions may be a characteristic of the carboxylate-incorporated MPO system.  Also, the hydrogen adsorption property of NTHU-8 may be conferred by the availability of intraframework carboxylate moieties.
