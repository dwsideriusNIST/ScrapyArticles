Crystal engineering, the design of mol. solids, is the synthesis of functional solid-state structures from neutral or ionic building blocks, using intermol. interactions in the design strategy.  H bonds, coordination bonds, and other less directed interactions define substructural patterns, referred to in the literature as supramol. synthons and secondary building units.  Crystal engineering has considerable overlap with supramol. chem., x-ray crystallog., materials science, and solid-state chem. and yet it is a distinct discipline in itself.  The subject goes beyond the traditional divisions of org., inorg., and phys. chem., and this makes for a very eclectic blend of ideas and techniques.  The purpose of this review is to highlight some current challenges in this rapidly evolving subject.  Among the topics discussed are the nature of intermol. interactions and their role in crystal design, the sometimes diverging perceptions of the geometrical and chem. models for a mol. crystal, the relation of these models to polymorphism, knowledge-based computational prediction of crystal structures, and efforts at mapping the pathway of the crystn. reaction.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXhtlyjsrrP&md5=10c6170fc8c1477b23bb9404f9a923f6", "(b) ", "Zheng", ", ", "S.-T.", "; ", "Wu", ", ", "T.", "; ", "Irfanoglu", ", ", "B.", "; ", "Zuo", ", ", "F.", "; ", "Feng", ", ", "P.", "; ", "Bu", ", ", "X.", " ", "Angew.

The authors' main objective is to offer an appropriate means to assist/aid chemists and material designers alike to rationally construct desired functional MOF materials, made-to-order MOFs.  The authors introduce the concept of net-coded building units (net-cBUs), where precise embedded geometrical information codes uniquely and matchlessly a selected net, as a compelling route for the rational design of MOFs.  This concept is based on employing pre-selected 0-periodic metal-org. polyhedra or 2-periodic metal-org. layers, SBBs or SBLs, resp., as a pathway to access the requisite net-cBUs.  In this review, inspired by the authors' success with the original rht-MOF, the authors extrapolated the authors' strategy to other known MOFs via their deconstruction into more elaborate building units (polyhedra or layers) to (i) elucidate the unique relation between edge-transitive polyhedra or layers and minimal edge-transitive 3-periodic nets, and (ii) illustrate the potential of the SBB and SBL approaches as a rational pathway for the design and construction of 3-periodic MOFs.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions/clusters coordinated by org. linkers (or bridging-ligands).  The hallmark of MOFs is their permanent porosity, which is frequently found in MOFs constructed from metal-clusters.  These clusters are often formed in situ, whereas the linkers are generally pre-formed.  The geometry and connectivity of a linker dictate the structure of the resulting MOF.  Adjustments of linker geometry, length, ratio, and functional-group can tune the size, shape, and internal surface property of a MOF for a targeted application.  In this crit. review, the authors highlight advances in MOF synthesis focusing on linker design.  Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, mol. recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described.  Further search for application-oriented MOFs through judicious selection of metal clusters and org. linkers is desirable.  In this review, linkers are categorized as ditopic (Section 1), tritopic (Section 2), tetratopic (Section 3), hexatopic (Section 4), octatopic (Section 5), mixed (Section 6), desymmetrized (Section 7), metallo (Section 8), and N-heterocyclic linkers (Section 9).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXht1Slu7jK&md5=322785c0256204742e3e95e5d2d49914", "(e) ", "Guillerm", ", ", "V.", "; ", "Weseli\u0144ski", ", ", "\u0141.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are a unique class of cryst. solids comprised of metal cations (or metal clusters) and org. ligands that have shown promise for a wide variety of applications.  Over the past 15 years, research and development of these materials have become one of the most intensely and extensively pursued areas.  A very interesting and well-investigated topic is their optical emission properties and related applications.  Several reviews have provided a comprehensive overview covering many aspects of the subject up to 2011.  This review intends to provide an update of work published since then and focuses on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of MOFs and their possible utility in chem. and biol. sensing and detection.

However, the systematic water stability studies required to develop design criteria for the construction of water-stable MOFs are still scarce.  In this work, the authors show that by varying the functional groups on the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) linker of DMOF [Zn(BDC)(DABCO)0.5], they can systematically tune the kinetic water stability of this isostructural, pillared family of MOFs.  To illustrate this concept, water adsorption studies were performed on four novel, methyl-functionalized DMOF variations along with a no. of already reported functionalized analogs contg. polar (fluorine) and nonpolar (methyl) functional groups on the BDC ligand.  These results are distinctly different from previous reports where the apparent water stability is improved through the inclusion of functional groups such as -CH3, -C2H5, and -CF3 which only serve to prevent significant amts. of water from adsorbing into the pores.  In this study, the authors present the first demonstration of tuning the inherent kinetic stability of MOF structures in the presence of large amts. of adsorbed water.  Notably, while the parent DMOF structure is unstable, the DMOF variation contg. the tetra-Me BDC ligand remains fully stable after adsorbing large amts. of water vapor during cyclic water adsorption cycles.  These trends cannot be rationalized in terms of hydrophobicity alone; exptl. water isotherms show that MOFs contg. the same no. of Me groups per unit cell will have different kinetic stabilities and that the precise placements of the Me groups on the BDC ligand are therefore critically important in detg. their stability in the presence of water.  Water adsorption isotherms, PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) patterns, and BET surface areas before and after water exposure are presented to illustrate these trends.  Furthermore, the important distinction between kinetic and thermodn. stability in MOFs is discussed.  Mol. simulations are also used to provide insight into the structural characteristics governing these trends in kinetic water stability.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhslyltLbK&md5=dd3cb8bf8450c769ce9f5856751aedab", "14.

While a no. of H2O-stable MOFs have emerged recently in the literature, the majority of MOFs are known to have poor H2O stability compared to zeolites and activated carbons, and there is therefore a crit. need to perform systematic H2O-stability studies and characterize MOFs comprehensively after H2O exposure.  Using these studies the authors can isolate the specific factors governing the structural stability of MOFs and direct the future synthesis efforts toward the construction of new, H2O-stable MOFs.  The authors have extended their previous work on the systematic H2O-stability studies of MOFs and synthesized new, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, and Zn-based, H2O-stable, pillared MOFs by incorporating structural factors such as ligand sterics and catenation into the framework.  Stability is assessed by using H2O vapor adsorption isotherms along with powder x-ray diffraction patterns and results from BET modeling of N2 adsorption isotherms before and after H2O exposure.  As expected, the authors' study demonstrates that unlike the parent DMOF structures (based on Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn metals), which all collapse under 60% relative humidity (RH), their corresponding tetramethyl-functionalized variations (DMOF-TM) are remarkably stable, even when adsorbing >20 mmol of H2O/g of MOF at 80% RH.  This behavior is due to steric factors provided by the Me groups grafted on the BDC (benzenedicarboxylic acid) ligand, as shown previously for the Zn-based DMOF-TM.  Also, 4,4',4'',4'''-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrabenzoic acid based, pillared MOFs (based on Co and Zn metals) also are stable after 90% RH exposure, even when the basicity of the bipyridyl-based pillar ligand is low.

Anal. of the heats of adsorption (Qst) for H2 reveals that with a triphenylamine moiety in the cage wall, desolvated NOTT-115 shows the highest value of Qst for these three materials, indicating that functionalization of the cage walls with more arom. rings can enhance the H2/framework interactions.

The MOF was shown to have a large hydrogen uptake, and this was studied using three different hydrogen potentials, effective for bulk hydrogen, but of varying sophistication: a model that includes only repulsion/dispersion parameters, one augmented with charge-quadrupole interactions, and one supplemented with many-body polarization interactions.  Calcd. hydrogen uptake isotherms and isosteric heats of adsorption, Qst, were in quant. agreement with expt. only for the model with explicit polarization.  This success in reproducing empirical measurements suggests that modeling MOFs that have open metal sites is feasible, though it is often not considered to be well described via a classical potential function; here it is shown that such systems may be accurately described by explicitly including polarization effects in an otherwise traditional empirical potential.  Decompn. of energy terms for the models revealed deviations between the electrostatic and polarizable results that are unexpected due to just the augmentation of the potential surface by the addn. of induction.  Charge-quadrupole and induction energetics were shown to have a synergistic interaction, with inclusion of the latter resulting in a significant increase in the former.  Induction interactions strongly influence the structure of the sorbed hydrogen compared to the models lacking polarizability; sorbed hydrogen is a dipolar dense fluid in the MOF.

The MOF is a decorated/substituted isostructural analog to the unembellished rht-MOF, PCN-61, that was studied previously.  The simulations were performed using three different hydrogen potentials of increasing complexity.  Simulated hydrogen sorption isotherms and calcd. isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, values were in excellent agreement with the reported exptl. data for only a polarizable model in one of four exptl. obsd. crystal structure configurations.  The study demonstrates the ability of modeling to distinguish the differential sorption of distinct structures; one configuration is found to be dominant due to favorable interactions with substrates.  In addn., the presence of polar amide groups had a significant effect on the electrostatics of the Cu2+ ions and directs the low-pressure physisorption of hydrogen in the MOF.  This is in contrast to what was obsd. in PCN-61, where an exterior copper ion had a higher relative charge and was the favored loading site.  This tunability of the electrostatics of the copper ions via chem. substitution on the MOF framework can be explained by the presence of the neg. charged oxygen atom of the amide group that causes the interior Cu2+ ion to exhibit a higher pos. charge through an inductive effect.  Further, control simulations, taking advantage of the flexibility afforded by theor. modeling, include artificially modified charges for both Cu2+ ions chosen equal to or with a higher charge on the exterior Cu2+ ion.  This choice resulted in distinctly different hydrogen sorption characteristics in Cu-TPBTM with no direct sorption on the open-metal sites.  Thus, this study demonstrates both the tunable nature of MOF platforms and the possibility for rational design of sorption/catalytic sites and characteristics through the active interplay of theory and expt.

Simulations involving explicit many-body polarization interactions assisted in the detn. of the binding sites in rht-MOF-1 through the distribution of the induced dipoles that led to strong adsorbate interactions.  Four distinct hydrogen sorption sites were detd. from the polarization distribution: the nitrate ions located in the corners of the truncated tetrahedral cages, the Cu2+ ions of the paddlewheels that project into the truncated tetrahedral and truncated octahedral cages (Cu1 ions), the Cu2+ ions of the Cu3O trimers (Cu3 ions), and the sides of the paddlewheels in the cuboctahedral cage.  The simulations revealed that the initial sorption sites for hydrogen in rht-MOF-1 are the nitrate ions; this site corresponds to the high initial Qst value for hydrogen (9.5 kJ mol-1) in the MOF.  The radial distribution functions, g(r), about the Cu2+ ions at various loadings revealed that the Cu1 ions are the preferred open-metal sorption sites for hydrogen at low loading, while the Cu3 ions become occupied at higher loadings.

As a proof of feasibility, mannose residues were added to the photolabel making it a potential photoaffinity label to tag proteins that bind mannose.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BC3MjoslKktg%253D%253D&md5=65d4503bf9f19b610f202d3bcac85cf4"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2015/cmatex.2015.27.issue-6/acs.chemmater.5b00084/20150318/images/small/cm-2015-000843_0010.gif\">"]}
