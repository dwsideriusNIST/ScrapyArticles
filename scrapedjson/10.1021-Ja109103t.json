To understand better the structure and function of biol. systems, cell biologists and biochemists would like to have methods that minimally perturb living systems.  The development of emissive optical probes is essential for improving the observation of intracellular signaling and recognition processes.  Following excitation of the probe, photons emitted from the probe may be obsd. by spectroscopy or microscopy and encode information about their environments in their energy, lifetime, and polarization.  Such optical probes may be based on org. fluorophores, quantum dots, recombinant proteins, or emissive metal complexes.  In this Account, the authors trace the emergence of lanthanide coordination complexes as emissive optical probes.  These probes benefit from sharp emission bands and long lifetimes.  These complexes can be designed to report on the concn. of key biochem. variables by modulation of spectral form, lifetime, or circular polarization.  These properties allow the application of ratiometric methods of anal. in spectroscopy or microscopy to report on local pH, pM (M = Ca, Zn), or the concn. of certain anionic metabolites, such as citrate, lactate, bicarbonate, or urate.  For optical microscopy studies in living cells, these probes must be cell-permeable and, ideally, should localize in a given cell organelle.  The authors undertook systematic studies of more than 60 emissive complexes, examg. the time dependence of cellular uptake and compartmentalization, cellular toxicity, protein affinity, and quenching sensitivity.  These results and their relation to probe structure have allowed the authors to identify certain structure-activity relationships.  The nature and linkage mode of the integral sensitizing group - introduced to harvest incident light efficiently - is of primary importance in detg. protein affinity and cellular uptake and trafficking.  In many cases, uptake may occur via macropinocytosis.  The authors have defined three main classes of behavior: complexes exhibit predominant localization profiles in protein-rich regions (nucleoli/ribosomes), in cellular mitochondria, or in endosomes/lysosomes.  Therefore, these systems offer considerable promise as intracellular optical probes, amenable to single- or two-photon excitation, that may report on the local ionic compn. of living cells subjected to differing environmental stresses.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXhtlehu7c%253D&md5=6a3853f1e20a040d12cd7f6e8cdafc8a", "(c) ", "Moore", ", ", "E.

Ligand-sensitized, luminescent lanthanide(III) complexes are of considerable importance because their unique photophys. properties (microsecond to millisecond lifetimes, characteristic and narrow emission bands, and large Stokes shifts) make them well suited as labels in fluorescence-based bioassays.  The long-lived emission of lanthanide(III) cations can be temporally resolved from scattered light and background fluorescence to vastly enhance measurement sensitivity.  One challenge in this field is the design of sensitizing ligands that provide highly emissive complexes with sufficient stability and aq. soly. for practical applications.  In this Account, the authors give an overview of some of the general properties of the trivalent lanthanides and follow with a summary of advances made in the authors' lab. in the development of highly luminescent Tb(III) and Eu(III) complexes for applications in biotechnol.  A focus of the authors' research was the optimization of these compds. as potential com. agents for use in homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) technol.  The authors' approach involves developing high-stability octadentate Tb(III) and Eu(III) complexes that rely on all-O donor atoms and using multichromophore chelates to increase molar absorptivity; earlier examples used a single pendant chromophore (i.e., a single antenna).  Ligands based on 2-hydroxyisophthalamide (IAM) provide exceptionally emissive Tb(III) complexes with quantum yield values up to \u223c60% that are stable at the nanomolar concns. required for com. assays.  Through synthetic modification of the IAM chromophore and time-dependent d. functional theory (TD-DFT) calcns., the authors have developed a method to predict absorption and emission properties of these chromophores as a tool to guide ligand design.  Addnl., the authors have studied chiral IAM ligands that yield Tb(III) complexes possessing both high quantum yield values and strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.  To efficiently sensitize Eu(III) emission, the authors used the 1-hydroxypyridin-2-one (1,2-HOPO) chelate to create remarkable ligands that combine excellent photophys. properties and exceptional aq. stabilities.  A more complete understanding of this chromophore was achieved by combining low-temp. phosphorescence measurements with the same TD-DFT approach used with the IAM system. Eu(III) complexes with strong CPL activity also were obtained with chiral 1,2-HOPO ligands.  The authors have also undertaken kinetic anal. of radiative and nonradiative decay pathways for Eu(III) complexes; the importance of the metal ion symmetry on the ensuing photophys. properties is clear.  Lastly, the authors describe a Tb(III)-IAM compd.-now carried through to com. availability-that offers improved performance in the common HTRF platform and has the potential to vastly improve sensitivity.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXjvVegsbo%253D&md5=c209016b0e79fa557cf27c05896b5173", "(d) ", "Uh", ", ", "H.", "; ", "Petoud", ", ", "S.", " ", "Compte Rendus Chimie", " ", "2010", ",  ", "13", ",  ", "668", "[", "Crossref", "], [", "CAS", "]", "1.

Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.  Because we can functionalize the pores to direct their specific recognition of small mols., the emerging porous MOFs serve as novel functional materials for gas storage, sepn., heterogeneous catalysis, and sensing.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlslyhtrs%253D&md5=f9230905a5656f9fe0e487967ecae356", "6.

The authors demonstrate a potential application of this system by showing a reversible and linear elec. response to gas in the tested range (5-27%).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXhtVegsrrJ&md5=85fdfc67de664290c0e20ad32bf27f73"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2011/jacsat.2011.133.issue-5/ja109103t/production/images/small/ja-2010-09103t_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2011/jacsat.2011.133.issue-5/ja109103t/production/images/small/ja-2010-09103t_0002.gif\">"]}
