Although this is an emerging field seeing a rapid development a no. of different applications on MOF films were either already demonstrated or are proposed.  This review focuses on the fabrication of continuous, thin porous films, either supported on solid substrates or as free-standing membranes.  The availability of such two-dimensional types of porous coatings opened the door for a no. of new perspectives for functionalizing surfaces.  Also for the porous materials themselves, the availability of a solid support to which the MOF-films are rigidly (in a mech. sense) anchored provides access to applications not available for the typical MOF powders with particle sizes of a few \u03bcm.  The authors will also address some of the potential and applications of thin films in different fields like luminescence, QCM-based sensors, optoelectronics, gas sepn. and catalysis.  A sep. chapter was devoted to the delamination of MOF thin films and discusses the potential to use them as free-standing membranes or as nanocontainers.  The review also demonstrates the possibility of using MOF thin films as model systems for detailed studies on MOF-related phenomena, e.g. adsorption and diffusion of small mols. into MOFs as well as the formation mechanism of MOFs (101 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXptFSrsw%253D%253D&md5=f0cfc5747b35e6a9477e04afd1d3381f", "(c) ", "B\u00e9tard", ", ", "A.", "; ", "Fischer", ", ", "R.
