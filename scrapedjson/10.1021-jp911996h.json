When the attraction between pore walls and adsorbed fluid molecules is strong enough, dense solidlike/compressed liquidlike layers of fluid are formed in the pores.

Clearly, parallel orientation of adsorbed molecules to the pore walls maximizes the adsorbate\u2212adsorbent dispersion interactions.

Clearly, the internal pore structure greatly impacts the deformation curves, since the solvation pressure is strongly affected by the size of the carbon pores.

This is because the assumed pore size distributions corresponding to counted carbon samples contain a fraction of the smallest ultramicropores with pore size below 0.31 nm.

It is worth underlining that, for the investigated values of bulk modulus, the maximum theoretical expansion of the carbon sample due to adsorption of carbon dioxide at 333 K and 27 MPa is around 4.2%.

It is important to note that this sample of porous carbon contains only wider pores above 0.4 nm (i.e., we cut the smallest ultramicropores characterized by high positive solvation force). The shape of the deformation curve computed for sample 4 is nonmonotonic with an initial contraction and further expansion, as is presented in Figure ", "6", ".

Note, however, that the magnitude of deformation computed for sample 4 is lower in comparison to all remaining studied samples of porous carbon.

Knowing the pore size distribution and bulk modulus of the investigated porous carbon, we compute adsorption and strain isotherms up to 27 MPa.

Ref. isotherms of N2, Ar, and CO2 in a series of model slit-shaped C pores in the range from 0.3-36 nm were calcd. from the nonlocal d. functional theory (NLDFT) using validated parameters of intermol. interactions.  CO2 isotherms were also generated by the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method based on the 3-center model of Harris and Yung.

Pore size distributions are calcd. by an adaptable procedure of deconvolution of the integral adsorption equation using regularization methods.  The deconvolution procedure implies the same grid of pore sizes and relative pressures for all adsorbates and the intelligent choice of regularization parameters.  The consistency of the approach was demonstrated on examples of pore structure characterization of activated C from adsorption isotherms of different gases and from different models (NLDFT and GCMC).  Since the CO2 isotherms measured up to 1 atm are not sensitive to pores wider then 1 nm, the NLDFT method for CO2 was extended to high-pressure CO2 adsorption up to 34 atm.

Arrangements of the carbon plates are driven by a systematic refinement of simulated carbon-carbon radial distribution functions to match exptl. measured radial distribution functions.  The adsorption of water in activated (having oxygenated surface groups) and nonactivated (graphitic) carbon is investigated using the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation method.  The adsorption behavior is found to be strongly dependent on the presence of activated sites.  No appreciable adsorption occurs in the graphitic carbon until the pressure approaches the bulk gas satn. pressure.  Effects of the surface site d., surface site position, and the magnitude of the surface site electrostatic charge on the adsorption behavior are investigated.  Water adsorption is found to increase as the activated site d. increases.  The presence of water vapor in porous carbons is shown to dramatically affect the connectivity of the available pore space.

Three types of pore wall were considered: graphitic carbon (strongly attractive walls), \"methane\" walls (wall attractions equal to those in the adsorbate phase), and hard walls.  For each system the change from a fluidlike to a solidlike adsorbed phase was obsd., and the shift in freezing or melting temp. from that of the bulk adsorbate material was detd.  As well as changes in the overall properties of the adsorbate phase, corresponding changes in the individual adsorbate layers in the pore were studied.  In addn. hysteresis on heating and cooling was examd.

In addn., the contact layer of adsorbate froze at a temp. higher than the inner layers.  For pores with CH4 walls (walls of LJ mols. having the same d. and intermol. interactions as the adsorbate phase) no shift in freezing temp. occurred, while pores with hard walls showed a decrease in freezing temp. relative to the bulk; in the case of hard walls, the contact layer of adsorbate froze at a lower temp. than the inner layers.  Considerable hysteresis was obsd. in some cases, and the width of the hysteresis loop was sensitive to pore size, being wider for pores in which the adsorbed layers are tightly packed.  The direction and magnitude of the shift in freezing temp. in the pore is strongly depends on the strength of the attractive forces between the adsorbate mols. and the wall, and particularly on the magnitude of this relative to such forces between the adsorbate and a wall composed of the same adsorbate mols.  A simple thermodn. model based on this idea is proposed, and showed to give a good account of the simulation results for CH4 in carbons.

We show that the spherically sym. effective CG potential constructed according to our scheme is able to reproduce structural/thermodn. properties of aprotic liqs.; the heat of vaporization and total bonding energy profile for monomer are reproduced with good accuracy, while the d. and radial distribution function are reproduced with fair accuracy within the proposed method.  In contrast, the isobaric heat capacity is underestimated in the CG simulation because some of the fluctuations have been washed out from atomistic aprotic liqs.  For protic liqs., spherically sym. effective CG potential produces more structure, enhanced packing of beads, and underestimated isobaric heat capacity of CG liqs.  This fundamental difference between protic and aprotic liqs. can be explained by the presence of short-range directional interactions in the former liqs.  We conclude that some information during the CG into spherically sym. interaction potentials of protic liqs. has to be lost.

Here we report the synthesis of nano- and micro-crystalline diamond-structured carbon, with cubic and hexagonal structure, by extracting silicon from silicon carbide in chlorine-containing gases at ambient pressure and temperatures not exceeding 1,000 degrees C.  The presence of hydrogen in the gas mixture leads to a stable conversion of silicon carbide to diamond-structured carbon with an average crystallite size ranging from 5 to 10 nanometres.  The linear reaction kinetics allows transformation to any depth, so that the whole silicon carbide sample can be converted to carbon.  Nanocrystalline coatings of diamond-structured carbon produced by this route show promising mechanical properties, with hardness values in excess of 50 GPa and Young's moduli up to 800 GPa.

Subsequently, the adsorption modeling study of simple gases (CH4 and CO2) in these Si-CDC samples for a wide range of pressures and temps. using the Finite Wall Thickness model [Nguyen, T.

In general, characterization results showed that the core of Si-CDC particles contains predominantly amorphous material while minor graphitization was also obsd. on the surface of these particles for all the studied synthesis temps. (600-1000\u00b0).  Also, postsynthetic heat treatment at 1000\u00b0 for 3 days, as well as particle size of precursor (\u03b2SiC) have slight impact on the graphitization.  In spite of the highly disordered nature of Si-CDC samples, the adsorption modeling results revealed that the Finite Wall Thickness model provides reasonably good prediction of exptl. adsorption data of CO2 and CH4 in all the studied Si-CDC samples at the temps. of 273 K, 313 K, and 333 K for a wide range of pressure up to 200 bar.  Also, the impact of the difference in mol. size and geometry between anal. and probing gases on the prediction of the exptl. adsorption isotherm in a disordered carbon using the slit-pore model is also found.  Finally, the correlation between compressibility of the Si-CDC samples under high pressure adsorption and their synthesis temp. was deduced from the adsorption modeling.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXisVWqsA%253D%253D&md5=a2eb1638689458ba32aba889d55ab9e0", " ", "63.

The proposed model implies that the structural transitions in MOFs occur when the stress reaches a certain crit. threshold.
