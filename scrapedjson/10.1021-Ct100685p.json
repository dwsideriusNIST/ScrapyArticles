Computation of atomic point charges for these hybrid materials is important in the field of molecular simulations for substantial prediction of experimental results. However, due to the structural complexity of advanced materials in general, studies involving derivation of point charges for these materials are truly scarce. In this article, we have derived the atomic point charges of ZIF\u20138 through fitting of the quantum electrostatic potential obtained systematically from density functional theory (DFT) calculations both on finite clusters of increasing size and on the periodic system. For the periodic system, fluctuations on the atomic charges have been studied through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Using the latter approach, we have extended the study to ZIF\u20132 and ZIF\u20133, where it has been found that charge fluctuations are, as well as for ZIF\u20138, very narrow, therefore justifying the use of the point charge approximation for these materials."], "text": ["Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Model and Simulation Details", "Results and Discussions", "Concluding Remarks", "References", "Introduction", "Microporous and nanoporous materials like zeolites are capturing increasingly large interest, especially in recent times, due to their high relevance in environmental, technological, and chemical applications.

Partial charges convey a chemically intuitive picture of how the electronic density within a molecule is distributed and are fundamental to describing the electrostatic interaction in classical simulations.

The building unit for the fragments of ZIF\u20138 is a methyl-imidazolate group (mIm) coordinating two Zn atoms; hence, the nomenclature of atoms in the supramolecular structure is straightforward.

In our study, Zn atoms at the vertices of square or hexagonal windows are bonded either to mIm groups or to NH", "3", " molecules. The need of using different groups coordinating zinc atoms originates from the fact that all of the fragments are charged. The overall charge cannot be neutralized while keeping the symmetry of the fragments at the same time; conserving the symmetry is of high importance because it allows the electronic density to be evenly shared on the core atoms, thus leading to more reliable results on the computed charges. On the other hand, it could be argued that the resulting charges would be affected by the total charge being different from zero. This considerations led us to perform calculations also on the periodic system, which is completely uncharged (see below).

All of the charge values converge to a stable value for a cutoff of 150 Ry, which coincides with the values for energy convergence; hence, the convergence of charges at this value of cutoff is related to the convergence of DFT calculations and not with the grid point used for the REPEAT fit. This analysis suggests that both GTH and TM pseudopotentials together with PBE and BLYP yield converged results for the charges with a small error. Using Gaussian basis sets, we have tested again the convergence of the charges with the pseudopotential cutoff for the density; in this case, only PBE with GTH pseudopotentials was tested in a cutoff range between 320 and 3000 Ry.

It can be seen that the values of the atomic charges converge to similar values, the largest differences being around 5%. Moreover, the fluctuations are almost negligible, hinting that using a simple point charge approximation for classical molecular dynamics simulations of ZIFs is sensible. We would like to notice that the calculations with plane waves (CPMD) and with Gaussian basis sets (BOMD) give basically the same results. Thus, both of them constitute sound methods to compute electrostatic potentials inside ZIFs. A comparison of the results obtained for the three different ZIFs considered here immediately highlights that the values for the point charges are quite different.

In our study, we explored different approaches to derive them for zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). The usual approach to compute partial charges for molecular systems is based on ab initio calculations on small clusters, followed by a fitting of the quantum chemical electrostatic potential. Among the many methods, we chose the Merz\u2013Kollman sampling scheme, which has been shown to give reliable results; we also found that, for computing partial charges, density functional theory calculations yield values comparable to the ones obtained with Hartree\u2013Fock and perturbative methods.", "Partial charges computed for molecules give a fair description of the electronic density of the isolated system, which is considered to be slightly perturbed in the condensed phase; thus, values calculated for the isolated systems are transferred to liquid/solid simulation with a negligible loss of accuracy. This approximation does not hold for crystal systems such as ZIFs; in fact, every atom/molecule in the supramolecular structure feels the crystalline environment, which should be somehow included in the description. Thus, for example, computing partial charges on the cluster formed by one zinc atom coordinated by four methyl-imidazolium molecules would make sense if we were interested only in the zinc charge. On the other hand, if we need to know the charges on N, we should consider a symmetric structure around the molecule.", "To this end, we have explored two different methodological approaches to compute partial charges on ZIF\u20138 from first principles calculations. The first approach has been based on the building up of isolated clusters resembling the structure and symmetry of the crystal. We have observed that, in order to obtain converged results, the size of the cluster should be around 400\u2013500 atoms, which renders this approach extremely computationally expensive. The second method is based on evaluating the REPEAT charges on the periodic crystal structure. In order to define an operative protocol to compute partial charges on ZIF\u20138 (which would be extended to similar materials), we compared the results obtained with two different functionals and six pseudopotentials. We found that ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials give larger errors compared to norm-conserving Troullier\u2013Martins or Goedecker\u2013Teter\u2013Hutter pseudopotentials. The results obtained with both PBE and BLYP functionals are in fair agreement, hinting that the computed properties are well described with the two of them. The convergence of results has been checked against the value of the pseudopotentials\u2019 cutoff. In the case of plane wave calculations, the partial charges converge at 150 Ry for the wave function cutoff, while for a mixed plane wave and Gaussian basis sets treatment, we found a density cutoff of 700 Ry to be the ideal choice. In passing, we notice that the values obtained for Zn and N are in agreement with those from recent studies", "(67-69)", " on ZIFs and on systems of biological interest.", "The values of REPEAT charges are also in agreement with those computed, at a much higher computational cost, on large isolated clusters. Given the reliability of the method, and considering its relatively low computational overhead, in the second part of the article, we looked into the fluctuations of charges, by propagating the system with DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations of the periodic structure. REPEAT charges have been computed for many configurations of three zeolite imidazolate frameworks, slightly differing among them in the structure and substituents: ZIF\u20138, ZIF\u20132, and ZIF\u20133.", "For ZIF\u20138, both Car\u2013Parrinello and Born\u2013Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations show that the value obtained in single point calculations are in agreement with the average value during the time evolution of the system. The common feature to the three ZIFs studied is that the fluctuations in the charges of every atom are small. To our knowledge, this represents the first study of atomic partial charges where the fluctuations are taken into account; our results justify the choice of using the point charge approximation for these kinds of materials, given that the fluctuations are negligible. Nevertheless, if highly charged or polarizable absorbates interact with the framework, the inclusion of polarization could be important in the description of physical chemical properties of ZIFs.

The force field correctly predicts a wide range of structural properties of this MOF, including a neg. thermal expansion of approx. 1% at 30 and 293 K, in agreement with both theory and expt.  Compressibility results and the assocd. elastic moduli are in also good agreement with published d. functional theory calcns. and nanoindentation expts.

This rotation becomes more prevalent as the temp. is increased from 300 to 400 K, in agreement with NMR data.  Simulations were also carried out with adsorbed guests, including ethanol, cyclohexane, and several chloromethanes.  It is shown that the IRMOF-1 lattice parameter depends on the nature of the guest-framework interaction; strongly hydrophilic guests, such as ethanol, cause a decrease (-0.9%) in unit cell vol., while hydrophobic guests cause an increase (0.7-1.5%) in unit cell vol.  The calcd. free vols. in IRMOF-1 range from 53.5% to 56.0%, in good agreement with expt.  Finally, the activation energy for benzene self-diffusion calcd. at low loadings is in good agreement with previous simulations and NMR results, but the magnitude of the diffusion const. is underestimated, most likely because of deficiencies in the CVFF portion of the force field.  The results demonstrate, however, that employing a rigid force field results in much poorer agreement with exptl. data.

Our aim is to improve the basic understanding of the polarity of compds. with a view to make force-field parametrizations more consistent and phys. realistic.  The concept is based on the relationship between the atomization energies of the elements and the possible strength of covalent bonding and the relationship between the ionization energies/electron affinities of the elements and the possible strength of ionic bonding.  Both quantities, energetically, are of the same order of magnitude and influence at. charges in a compd., which we illustrate by trends across the periodic table.  The relationship between the pure elements and a given compd. is shown in an extended Born model.  We note that the extended Born model can be used to obtain phys. justified charge ests., relative to available ref. compds.  This semiempirical concept has a stronger foundation than electronegativity equalization [Rappe, A. K.; Goddard, W. A., III. J. Phys.

Conventional ESP fitting procedures developed for mol. systems, in general, will not work for cryst. systems because the electrostatic potential in periodic systems is ill-defined up to a const. offset at each spatial position.  In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its abs. values, as it is currently done with mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  We formally demonstrate that the new functional reduces to the conventional error functional used in mol.

For the periodic calcn. of isolated mols., the REPEAT charges are found to be in good agreement with those detd. with established mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional mol. ESP approaches generate 'unphys.' charges, whereas the REPEAT method produces charges that are both chem. intuitive and consistent between different periodic electronic structure packages.  The new approach is employed to generate partial at. charges of various microporous materials and compared to both exptl. derived and mol. fragment ESP charges.

In summary, by applying pressure to ZIF-8 the hydrostatic medium can be forced to enter the pore, initially increasing the vol. of both the nanopore and the unit cell.  On increasing pressure further, more solvent can be forced into the nanopore, even though the nanopore vol. decreases, until the sample undergoes a phase transition.  This transition not only allows more solvent to enter the original nanopore, but it increases the size of the narrow channels that connect these pores, resulting in an overall increase in porous vol. and amt. of sequestered solvent.  Modification of the pore vol., size, shape, and therefore selectivity has thus been achieved on application of pressure.

On the basis of this thought, this work provides a strategy for estg. framework charges in MOFs.  We developed a so-called connectivity-based atom contribution method (CBAC), in which it is assumed that the atoms with same bonding connectivity have identical charges in different MOFs.  The results for 43 MOFs including a training set of 30 MOFs and a test set of 13 MOFs show that the CBAC charges give nearly identical results to those from quantum mech. calcns. for adsorption isotherms of CO2, CO, and N2 in them.  Since the method will readily include new atom types, it is applicable to any MOF as long as its structure is known.  The strategy, which is applicable to other porous materials, paves a way for large-scale computational screening of MOFs for specific applications as well as contributes to a better understanding of the structure-property relationships for MOFs and eventually contributes to the development and application of MOFs.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXis1CnsLw%253D&md5=a8cdcd757bc392e107e9eced221a9b54"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2011/jctcce.2011.7.issue-6/ct100685p/production/images/small/ct-2010-00685p_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2011/jctcce.2011.7.issue-6/ct100685p/production/images/small/ct-2010-00685p_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2011/jctcce.2011.7.issue-6/ct100685p/production/images/small/ct-2010-00685p_0003.gif\">"]}
