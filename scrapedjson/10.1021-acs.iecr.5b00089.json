The presence of the gold after rigorous washing highlights the robust chemical attachment of the metal to the surface of the particles.", "To ensure that the coating observed on the fabric was gold, scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis data were gathered and confirmed the presence of not only gold, but also sulfur and chlorine.

The synthesis section of the ", "SI", " identifies these differences and highlights when each method was used. In this example, the cysteamine has taken the place of the traditional chromophores and is available for additional reaction; however, other thiols, such as 6-amino-1-hexanethiol, could have also been used. Likewise, the platform nature of the RDM allows other functional groups, such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, amines, esters, and others, to be used to bind nanostructures to the reactive dye or substrate.", "It is important to highlight that the fabric swatch was cut from a sample of nylon purchased from commercial retail store, which illustrates that it is not necessary to have laboratory grade nylon and that this approach can be applied to industrially produced fabrics. The RDM was also used to modify 0.5 in.", "2", " cellulose swatches. As was done for the nylon sample, a commercially available cellulose sample was obtained, in this case, a plain white T-shirt purchased from a commercial retailer, reflecting the ease of application of this approach to existing commercially available fibers. Also, reactive dye chemistry is known to be applicable to wool and silk, and, in this work, cellulose was selected as a representative example of these natural fibers. Moreover, illustration of the RDM to cellulose is broadly applicable to fabrics as well as other cellulose materials, such as wood or paper.", "With the FESEM illustrating gold covering a large portion of the fiber surface, it was hypothesized that these materials could provide a starting point for the construction of self-assembled monolayers or more complex nanostructures. To support this concept, cellulose and nylon were modified to contain copper for the development of an organized crystalline copper based MOF. Using the same platform approach that was used to attach gold to fibers, a fabric sample was modified with cyanuric chloride, functionalized with cysteamine, and then copper was bound to the thiol. In this case, the copper was added via copper nitrate to illustrate that the RDM approach does not specifically require a controlled metal nanoparticle in suspension. After the copper was added to the fabric using the RDM platform, the fabric was used as a metal structural building unit for the construction of a Cu-BTC MOF crystal, as shown in Figure ", "3", ".", "Figure 3.

Specifically, the cotton sample adsorbed 2 mol/kg of ammonia in a 25 \u00b0C (50% relative humidity) air stream, and the nylon Cu-BTC sample produced a lower 0.5 mol/kg loading, which is consistent with the lower surface area of the Cu-BTC nylon sample.", "To illustrate the application of RDM technology to optical nanostructures and surfaces, 6 nm CdSeS/ZnS alloyed quantum dots with a fluorescence of 505 nm were added to cellulose and nylon.

Some large particle aggregations were observed on the fibers in some images, and EDX data indicated Zn in these aggregations, which is consistent with the CdSeS/ZnS composition of the quantum dot.", "To observe the loading of the quantum dots on the fabric, maximum-intensity projections were generated from spectral confocal microscopy image data, as shown in Figure ", "4", ". By measuring spectra of the native quantum dots in solution, the unlabeled fabric, and the composite, the spectral image data were linearly unmixed to show unmodified nylon fiber and quantum dot fluorescence false-colored in dark blue and yellow, respectively.

The sample in Figure ", "4", "a was prepared using cysteamine (process 3a in the ", "SI", "). When this sample was washed with soap, however, the large deposits appear to be more distributed across the fibers but the quantum dots remain well attached to the fabric.

To acquire a more uniform distribution of quantum dots, it may be necessary to adjust the sequence of the RDM steps, the types of solvents used in the process, or the temperature of the reaction.", "The optical measurements also confirmed that the observed fluorescence emission spectrum of the quantum dots in solution has not changed upon binding to the fiber surface. Specifically, a sample of the solution that was used as the source of the quantum dots for the experiments shown in Figure ", "4", ", was placed on a glass slide and imaged using the same settings used to image the fibers. The quantum dot solution fluoresced at a peak emission wavelength of 505 nm, using a 405 nm laser for excitation, and the observed fluorescence of the quantum dots bound to the fabric was also 505 nm, showing, as expected, that the RDM of attachment has not altered the fluorescence.", "The RDM was repeated using quantum dots with fluorescence wavelengths of 525, 575, 630, and 665 nm, producing fabrics of different colors, as shown in Figure ", "4", "g.

The presence of fluorescence after these washings emphasizes the robust attachment of the nanoparticles to the fibers.", "The results discussed illustrate the use of reactive dye chemistry to attach nanostructures to fibers. The approach is applicable to synthetic and natural fibers and can be used as a starting point for the assembly of complex nanostructures, such as MOFs on fibers. Likewise, the gold in the modified fibers is available for surface chemistry reactions and provides a starting point for applying other gold based nanotechnology, such as self assembled monolayers, to fibers. The MOF modified fibers show selectivity for ethylene over ethane and removed ammonia from a humid air stream. The quantum dot fibers fluoresce with the same wavelength of the bulk solution, even though the particles are bound to the surface. The gold and quantum dot examples provided survive not only solvent washes, such as acetone, chloroform, and hexane, but also soap and water washes. The MOF modified fibers survive washes with solvents, but were not washed with water, because of Cu-BTC instability.

The results revealed that the amt. of Ag agglomerates and NPs deposited on CMC fibers was higher than that deposited on cellulose fibers at similar pH conditions, and that barely any Ag agglomerates or NPs were deposited on the CA fibers.  These results implied that functional groups on the cellulose backbone played two important roles in the deposition of NPs as follows: (1) Hydrogen bonding was the main driving force for agglomeration of NPs when the medium pH was below 4.4, which corresponds to the pKa of carboxylic acid groups; (2) Carboxymethyl groups could replace citrate groups as stabilizers allowing the fabrication of a uniform and evenly distributed Ag NPs layer over CMC fibers at higher pH values.

The printed HKUST-1 films are characterized by a hierarchical, surfactant-free pore structure, which makes them promising materials for gas capture and heterogeneous catalysis, since the diffusion of guest mols. becomes facilitated.  HKUST-1 SURMOFs printed on textiles are able to capture several hazardous gases and indicate this process by a unique color change, which might be useful for personal protection applications.  The high accessible pore vol. of HKUST-1 films was confirmed by QCM measurements and resulted in excellent adsorption properties for several hazardous gases.
