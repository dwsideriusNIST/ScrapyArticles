Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.  Hence, one of the important challenges going forward is to find ways to pack MOFs efficiently without serious damage or to synthesize MOFs that can withstand substantial mech. pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtV2msbrN&md5=23f9bfad78f204569f0bf7c902d42dca", "16.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.

The efforts focused on how both geometric and chem. properties, such as void fraction (Vf), volumetric surface area (Sv), and heat of adsorption (Qst), impact methane deliverable capacity, i.e., the amt. of methane adsorbed at some storage pressure minus the amt. adsorbed at the delivery pressure.

From the simulation results, the authors developed an anal. equation that helped one delimit the necessary material properties to reach specific methane deliverable capacity targets.  The max. deliverable capacity between 65 and 5.8 bar among the hypothetical MOFs was 206 cm3(STP)/cm3 at 298 K.  Artificially increasing the methane-MOF interaction strength by increasing the Lennard-Jones \u03b5 parameters of the MOF atoms by 2- and 4-fold only improved the max. deliverable capacity up to 223 and 228 cm3(STP)/cm3, resp.  However, the effect on the amt. stored at 65 bar was more significant, which suggested another strategy; raising the temp. of the system by 100 K can recover \u223c70% of the methane stranded at the delivery pressure.  By increasing the delivery temp. to 398 K, the ARPA-E target was reached by a few hypothetical MOFs with quadrupled \u03b5 values.

Finally, the amt. of usable stored methane was examd. for two operating scenarios: isothermal pressure swing (PS) and a combined temp./pressure swing (TPS).  Under these conditions, PCN-11 and Be-DOBDC yield the best combination of gravimetric and volumetric methane densities at pressures below \u223c50 bar, while MOF-5 is best at higher pressures.  We conclude that enhanced binding sites, such as coordinatively unsatd. metal sites, can be detrimental for PS operation at higher pressures due to their tendency to retain adsorbed methane at low (desorption) pressures.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXpt1KqsA%253D%253D&md5=da4cfb2c9f47b2e6a300afe0a150c325", "46.

We considered four non-tetrahedral monomers with four boronic acid groups inspired by the corresponding carboxylate linkers known from metal-org. frameworks, and investigated the potential 3,4-connected topologies with edge-transitivity (ctn, bor, pto and tbo) or transitivity 32 (ofp, tfj, fjh, iab and nju).

All structures are completely relaxed by including the lattice parameters.  From the atomistic structures, the accessible surface areas were detd., and, because of the isomer screening procedure, the question of crystallog. disorder could also be answered.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.

In its perfect crystal structure, each Zr metal center is fully coordinated by 12 org. linkers to form a highly connected framework.  Using high-resoln. neutron power diffraction technique, we found the first direct structural evidence showing that real UiO-66 material contains significant amt. of missing-linker defects, an unusual phenomenon for MOFs.  The concn. of the missing-linker defects is surprisingly high, \u223c10% in our sample, effectively reducing the framework connection from 12 to \u223c11.  We show that by varying the concn. of the acetic acid modulator and the synthesis time, the linker vacancies can be tuned systematically, leading to dramatically enhanced porosity.  We obtained samples with pore vols. ranging from 0.44 to 1.0 cm3/g and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas ranging from 1000 to 1600 m2/g, the largest values of which are \u223c150% and \u223c60% higher than the theor. values of defect-free UiO-66 crystal, resp.  The linker vacancies also have profound effects on the gas adsorption behaviors of UiO-66, in particular CO2.  Finally, comparing the gas adsorption of hydroxylated and dehydroxylated UiO-66, we found that the former performs systematically better than the latter (particularly for CO2) suggesting the beneficial effect of the -OH groups.  This finding is of great importance because hydroxylated UiO-66 is the practically more relevant, non-air-sensitive form of this MOF.  The preferred gas adsorption on the metal center was confirmed by neutron diffraction measurements, and the gas binding strength enhancement by the -OH group was further supported by our first-principles calcns.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtValsLrL&md5=c1ead8cbafaae77968f37490e2bb14f6", "59.

In an attempt to validate the use of a scaling factor, in this work we compare adsorption properties of N2, O2, Ar, CO2, C3H8 and SF6 on Cu-BTC (HKUST-1) framework synthesized using two different procedures.  It was obsd. that Cu-BTC sample with higher surface area and pore vol. has greater adsorption capacity for all gases at the two temps. considered (298.25 and 318.15 K).  For all gases, the ratio of specific adsorption capacities of the two samples can be broadly classified into two regions.  In the low loading region this ratio was about 2.03 with in a 10% uncertainty envelope.  However, in the high loading region, it increases to about 2.58.  Thus, the scaling factor needed to compare adsorption isotherms of Cu-BTC having different surface areas may not be unique.
