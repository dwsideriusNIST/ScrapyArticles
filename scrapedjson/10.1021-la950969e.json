It is proposed that the density obtained with helium at high temperature, for instance, at the regeneration temperature of the adsorbent, be considered as the adsorbent density. Using the corrected densities of 3A, 4A, 5A, and 13X zeolites and of activated and graphitized carbons and of silica gel, we experimentally determined the adsorption of helium on the above mentioned adsorbents at room temperature and in a large pressure range up to 500 MPa. The shape of the adsorption isotherm reveals no saturation at high pressure. These experimental data are in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of adsorption of a Lennard-Jones gas by a rigid plane as well as by a microporous rigid solid interface. We also examined implications of the new helium density of activated carbon for our previous measurements of adsorption at high pressure. The result is the disappearance of the inexplicable negative part of the isotherms and even a renewed increase in the curves at high pressure. Moreover, a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations of argon adsorption on microporous graphite is in good agreement with the shape of the adsorption curve at high pressure. Finally, the role of the microporous structure of adsorbents and of the gas\u2212adsorbent interaction in adsorption at high pressure is discussed. "], "text": [" ", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "I.

These observations illustrate the fact that, at moderate densities, the influence on adsorption of molecular attractive forces is at a maximum but decreases progressively as density increases and then vanishes at high densities at which repulsive interaction forces predominate.

As in ref 9, the accessible volume to the gas corresponds to the volume where the average gas density is different from zero. The resulting isotherms exhibit a similar maximum for the plane and for microporous graphite, but in the latter case adsorption is lower.

Moreover, in this range, experimental data would be well fitted with a simulation curve obtained with a helium density of adsorbent of 1.8 g cm", "-3", " and without any noticeable alteration in the first ", " part of the isotherm. The explanation lies in the fact that micropores of activated carbon are less accessible to argon atoms than to helium atoms, the consequence being that adsorbent helium density has a high value. A coherent comparison of simulation with the experiment could be made if adsorbent density was measured with argon itself as was the case for helium in the preceding paragraph. Such a remark can be extended to all gas atoms and molecules to which micropores are less accessible than to helium atoms. Helium densities are thus inadapted and corresponding adsorption has an erroneous value, especially at high pressure. Indeed, the ideal method according to the Gibbs surface definition would be to measure the adsorbent density for each gas with the gas itself, but this may not be practical. On the other hand, when Monte Carlo simulations are extended to more adsorbent models and gases, it will be possible to make reliable corrections of helium density with the help of a fit of the simulation curve.
