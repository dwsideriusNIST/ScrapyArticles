The TFA mols. were found to be firmly anchored on the surface of the mesoporous supports without affecting their acidity.  The effect of the pore and cage diam. of the KIT-5 supports on the loading of TFA mols. inside the pore channels was also demonstrated.  The total acidity of the materials increases with an increase in the TFA loading on the support, whereas the acidity of the materials decreases with an increase in the pore diam. of the support.  The acidity of the TFA-functionalized mesoporous nanocages is much higher than that of the zeolites and metal-substituted mesoporous acidic catalysts.  The TFA-functionalized materials have also been employed as the catalysts for the synthesis of 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin by means of the Pechmann reaction under solvent-free conditions.  The catalytic activity of the TFA-functionalized KIT-5 is much higher than that of zeolites and metal-substituted mesoporous catalytic materials in the synthesis of coumarin derivs.  The stability of the catalyst is extremely good and it can be reused several times without much loss of activity in the above reaction.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXislKns78%253D&md5=6a7ab6728ee29b1a88277bb90f6aa355", "13.

The condensation reaction was studied in detail by varying the reaction parameters, i.e., effect of solvent, molar ratio of reactants, temp., and catalyst loading.  Among the substituted phenols, m-aminophenol is more reactive and 100% yield is obtained in short time at low temp. due to the presence of ring activating amine group in the meta position.  The m-ZrP catalyst is also active even for phenol and 57% yield of 4-Me coumarin is obtained in the conventional heating method.  Microwave assisted synthesis is advantageous over conventional heating for the synthesis of coumarins, as it provides improved yield in less time.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhvVyks78%253D&md5=9d0b41f037f71c6173b4b58385abd806", "38.

A systematic study of this reaction has been made by varying the following parameters: catalyst, amt. of catalyst, duration and temp. of reaction and molar ratio of reactants.  Under refluxing conditions, in the presence of sulfated zirconia, the percentage yield of the product, 7-hydroxy 4-Me coumarin was in the range of 30-75% which, however, contained many impurities.  When the same reaction was conducted in an autoclave at 150\u00b0C, the clean product of yields upto 99% was obtained.  Other phenols used in this work include catechol, hydroquinone, m-cresol, p-cresol, o-cresol, pyrogallol, phloroglucinol, orcinol, m-aminophenol and phenol.  The sites of higher acid strength and perhaps super-acidic sites on the catalyst appear to be catalyzing the formation of coumarins via Pechmann reaction.  Sulfated zirconia is found to be a promising catalyst for this reaction under autogenous conditions.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXovFaktbg%253D&md5=cf8fa5e059be6a59efec03995c51ae0e", "39.
