The solvent is a critical parameter influencing the formation of MOFs; typically, water, alcohols, ketones, esters, acids, acetates, and alkanes, and their mixtures, are used for this purpose.

The inhibitors studied included Na pyrophosphate, Na hexametaphosphate (SHMP), nitrilotris(methylenephosphonic acid) (NTMP), 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP), ethylenediaminetetra(methylenephosphonic acid) (ETMP) hexamethylenediaminetetra(methylenephosphonic acid) (HMDP) and myoinositol hexaphosphoric acid (phytic acid).  The effects of these inhibitors on the growth kinetics were studied at several inhibitor concns.  The retarding effect of these inhibitors is discussed in relation to Ca-inhibitor complex formation on the DCPD seed crystals and the structural features of the inhibitor mols.  The fit of the Langmuir adsorption to exptl. data supports a mechanism of inhibition through mol. adsorption of the inhibitor ions on the surface of growing crystals.

In redn. methods, birnessite evolves from the initially produced amorphous manganese oxide (AMO gel).  For redox methods, both mechanisms exist, with the latter prevailing.  A liq. mechanism is proposed to describe the redn. and redox synthesis, which comprises three stages: an induction period, a fast crystn. period, and a steady-state period.  The redox method is accompanied by the formation and phase transformation of feitknechtite to birnessite.
