", "2011", "). Ethylene (C", "2", "H", "4", ") is an important petrochemical used widely as a raw material for the production of plastics, rubbers, fuel components and other organic chemicals (Moura et al. ", "2015", "). The main method for the production of ethylene is steam cracking and dehydrogenation of ethane (C", "2", "H", "6", "), inevitably yielding an ethylene/ethane mixture (Shi et al. ", "2010", "). The ethylene/ethane mixture must be then separated to produce high purity ethylene. Due to the similar relative volatilities and molecular sizes, the separation of ethylene over ethane is one of the most challenging chemical separations at a large scale (Eldridge ", "1993", "). Currently, the dominant technology for ethylene/ethane separation is cryogenic distillation, which is performed under the conditions of high pressure (2.3\u00a0MPa) and low temperature (248\u00a0K), resulting in an extremely cost- and energy-intensive process (Rege et al. ", "1998", "). Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to develop cost-effective approaches for ethylene/ethane separations, including membrane separation (Bux et al. ", "2011", "; Ploegmakers et al. ", "2013", "; Salinas et al. ", "2016", "), liquid absorption (Reine and Eldridge ", "2005", "; Yu et al. ", "2015", ") and adsorption processes (Yang ", "2003", "). Among these approaches, the adsorptive separation using porous solid adsorbents appears to be the most attractive alternative because of its great potential to afford much lower cost and energy consumption (Lamia et al. ", "2009", ").", "For the adsorptive separation, the solid adsorbents play the key role in determining the separation performance. The reported porous solid materials including activated carbon (Zhu et al. ", "2005", "), zeolites (Anson et al. ", "2008", "; Mofarahi and Salehi ", "2013", "; Vargas-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. ", "2015", "), metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) (Hartmann et al. ", "2015", "; Martins et al. ", "2015", "), hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) (Li et al. ", "2014b", ") and carbon nanotubes (Albesa et al. ", "2012", ") have good adsorption capacity of ethylene. However, these materials have lower adsorption selectively of ethylene to ethane. The \u03c0-complexation adsorbents have been paid great attention for olefin/paraffin separations (Grande et al. ", "2004", ", ", "2005", "; Aguado et al. ", "2012", "; Li et al. ", "2014a", "; Zhang et al. ", "2015", "), because these adsorbents could achieve high olefins adsorption capacity and high olefin/paraffin adsorption selectivity, resulting from the stronger \u03c0-complexation interactions between olefins and transition-metal ions of Cu", "+", " or Ag", "+", " on the adsorbents. Huang et al. (", "1999", ") found that Cu", "+", " ions formed stronger \u03c0-complexation bonding with ethylene than Ag", "+", " ions, resulting that the Cu(I)-based adsorbents have higher adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity for ethylene compared with Ag(I)-based adsorbents. Huang (", "1973", ") and Golden et al. ", "(1992)", " prepared the Cu(I) \u03c0-complexation adsorbents by impregnating zeolites or activated carbon with CuCl", "2", " aqueous solution and then reducing Cu", "2+", " into Cu", "+", " using reducing gases. Hirai et al. (", "1986a", ") and Tamon et al. (", "1996", ") prepared the Cu(I) \u03c0-complexation adsorbents by dispersing CuCl onto the surfaces of porous supports using concentrated hydrochloric acid as solvent and then heating at high temperatures in an inert atmosphere. Chang et al. (", "2014", ") dispersed CuCl onto the surfaces of MIL-101 using the double-solvent of concentrated hydrochloric acid and hexane. Over the past decades, numerous Cu(I) \u03c0-complexation adsorbents were prepared by dispersing CuCl powder spontaneously onto the surfaces of porous supports at high temperatures in an inert atmosphere (Yang and Kikkinides ", "1995", "; Cheng and Yang ", "1995", "; Xie et al. ", "1997", "). Generally, apart from the intensive preparation processes, the adsorbents prepared with the impregnation method and the dispersion method using dispersing reagents always have lower copper loadings compared with the solid-state dispersion method (Ma et al. ", "2010", "). In addition, the preparation of the Cu(I)-based adsorbents with CuCl as raw material must be performed in a dry inert atmosphere to protect Cu", "+", " ions from oxidation and hydrolysis. In our previous studies for the CO separation, the Cu(I) \u03c0-complexation adsorbents were successfully prepared with CuCl", "2", " as precursor through solid-state dispersion method, and the obtained adsorbents displayed the high CO adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity (Gao et al.

The results in Fig.\u00a0", "8", " show that the ethylene adsorption amounts are nearly identical in the five adsorption/desorption cycles. This suggests that the prepared CuCl/AC adsorbent can be stably employed in cyclic ethylene adsorption via a vacuum swing operation at ambient temperature.

The variation in isosteric heats of adsorption may be associated with surface heterogeneity of the AC support, causing the active components of Cu", "+", " ions supported on AC with different adsorption activities to ethylene.
