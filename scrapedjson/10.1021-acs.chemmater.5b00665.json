The authors' main objective is to offer an appropriate means to assist/aid chemists and material designers alike to rationally construct desired functional MOF materials, made-to-order MOFs.  The authors introduce the concept of net-coded building units (net-cBUs), where precise embedded geometrical information codes uniquely and matchlessly a selected net, as a compelling route for the rational design of MOFs.  This concept is based on employing pre-selected 0-periodic metal-org. polyhedra or 2-periodic metal-org. layers, SBBs or SBLs, resp., as a pathway to access the requisite net-cBUs.  In this review, inspired by the authors' success with the original rht-MOF, the authors extrapolated the authors' strategy to other known MOFs via their deconstruction into more elaborate building units (polyhedra or layers) to (i) elucidate the unique relation between edge-transitive polyhedra or layers and minimal edge-transitive 3-periodic nets, and (ii) illustrate the potential of the SBB and SBL approaches as a rational pathway for the design and construction of 3-periodic MOFs.

Ion conduction and transport in solids are both interesting and useful and are found in widely distinct materials, from those in battery-related technologies to those in biol. systems.  Scientists have approached the synthesis of ion-conductive compds. in a variety of ways, in the areas of org. and inorg. chem.  Recently, based on their ion-conducting behavior, porous coordination polymers (PCPs) and metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) were recognized for their easy design and the dynamic behavior of the ionic components in the structures.  These PCP/MOFs consist of metal ions (or clusters) and org. ligands structured via coordination bonds.  They could have highly concd. mobile ions with dynamic behavior, and their characteristics have inspired the design of a new class of ion conductors and transporters.  In this Account, the authors describe the state-of-the-art of studies of ion cond. by PCP/MOFs and nonporous coordination polymers (CPs) and offer future perspectives.  PCP/MOF structures tend to have high hydrophilicity and guest-accessible voids, and scientists have reported many water-mediated proton (H+) conductivities.  Chem. modification of org. ligands can change the hydrated H+ cond. over a wide range.  However, the designable structures also permit water-free (anhyd.) H+ cond.  The incorporation of protic guests such as imidazole and 1,2,4-triazole into the microchannels of PCP/MOFs promotes the dynamic motion of guest mols., resulting in high H+ conduction without water.  Not only the host-guest systems, but the embedding of protic org. groups on CPs also results in inherent H+ cond.  The authors obsd. high H+ conductivities under anhyd. conditions and in the intermediate temp. region of org. and inorg. conductors.  The keys to successful construction are highly mobile ionic species and appropriate intervals of ion-hopping sites in the structures.  Lithium (Li+) and other ions can also be transported.  If the authors can optimize the crystal structures, this could offer further improvements in terms of both cond. and the working temp. range.  Another useful characteristic of PCP/MOFs is their wide application to materials fabrication.  The authors can easily prep. heterodomain crystal systems, such as core-shell or solid soln.  Other anisotropic morphologies (thin film, nanocrystal, nanorod, etc.,) are also possible, with retention of the ion cond.  The flexible nature also lets the authors design morphol.-dependent ion-conduction behaviors that the authors cannot observe in the bulk state.  The authors propose (1) multivalent ion and anion conductions with the aid of redox activity and defects in structures, (2) control of ion transport behavior by applying external stimuli, (3) anomalous cond. at the hetero-solid-solid interface, and (4) unidirectional ion transport as in the ion channels in membrane proteins.  In the future, scientists may use coordination polymers not only to achieve higher cond. but also to control ion behavior, which will open new avenues in solid-state ionics.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXosFynsLo%253D&md5=826f3cfe1126835b7cdcef5955e65c47", "(c) ", "Ramaswamy", ", ", "P.", "; ", "Wong", ", ", "N.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.

Each type of mols. adsorb preferentially in two different porosities of the material, i.e., while CO2 occupy the tetrahedral cages, CH4 are pushed to the octahedral cages.  Further, a very unusual dynamic behavior was also pointed out with the slower mol., i.e., CO2, enhancing the mobility of the fast one, i.e., CH4, that contrasts with those usually obsd. so far for the CO2/CH4 mixt. in narrow window zeolites where the mols. are most commonly diffusing independently or slowing-down the partner species.

By varying the amt. of benzoic or acetic acid, the synthesis of Zr-bdc can be modulated.  With increasing concn. of the modulator, the products change from intergrown to individual crystals, the size of which can be tuned.  Addn. of benzoic acid also affects the size and morphol. of Zr-bpdc and, addnl., makes the synthesis of Zr-bpdc highly reproducible.  The control of crystal and particle size is proven by powder XRD, SEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements.  TGA and Ar sorption expts. show that the materials from modulated syntheses can be activated and that they exhibit high sp. surface areas.  Water proved to be essential for the formation of well-ordered Zr-bdc-NH2.  Zr-tpdc-NH2, a material with a structure analogous to that of Zr-bdc and Zr-bpdc, but with the longer, functionalized linker 2'-amino-1,1':4',1''-terphenyl-4,4''-dicarboxylic acid, was obtained as single crystals.
