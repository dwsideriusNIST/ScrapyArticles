On the contrary, propylene preferentially interacts with the CUS (56 kJ mol-1), while the adsorption at the cage center and cage window sites is only 45 and 34 kJ mol-1, resp.  Due to the topol. of CuBTC, lateral interactions are significantly more important among the adsorbates located at the cage center and cage window sites (populated in the case of propane) than among adsorbates at the CUS and cage center sites (populated in the case of propylene).  Therefore, adsorption energies obtained for coverages >6 mmol g-1 of adsorbed amt. were larger for propane than for propylene.

Samples of IRMOF-1 with sp. surface areas of around 1000 m2/g show heats of adsorption for alkanes that are higher than those estd. previously via Monte Carlo calcns.  Although the data for nonpolar (and weakly polar) species showed many of the anticipated trends for the interactions with IRMOF-1, the equil. behavior of polar VOCs did not correlate well with the mol. properties of the adsorbate (i.e., vapor pressure and deformation polarizability), leaving some uncertainty about the nature of the interaction mechanism.  The equil. data and the heats of adsorption were found to fit well to a small group of mol. descriptors through the application of the Abraham linear free-energy relationship, thus providing insight into the complex interactions between the MOF structure and the VOC compds.  Hydrogen bonding interactions were detd. to be the primary contributors to specific interactions between adsorbates and the MOF surface.

First, the strength and geometrical characteristics of the optimal xylene-xylene interactions are quantified by studying the pure and mixed pairs in gas phase.  An extended set of initial structures is created and optimized to sample as many relative orientations and distances as possible.  Next, the pairs are brought in the pores of MIL-47.  The interaction with the terephthalic linkers and other xylenes increases the stacking energy in gas phase (-31.7 kJ/mol per pair) by roughly a factor four in the fully loaded state (-58.3 kJ/mol per xylene).  Our decompn. of the adsorption energy shows various trends in the contributing xylene-xylene interactions.

There is a great need to identify high-performance nanoporous materials for gas storage, sepn. and catalysis to solve a wide range of industrially relevant challenges.  Mol. simulations have become an important complement to expts. in the screening and selection of suitable porous materials.  Successful implementation of mol. simulations requires accurate force fields (FFs) to describe the interactions of guest mols. with porous frameworks.  However, developing accurate and transferable FFs for porous materials can be extremely challenging.  While generic FFs and exptl.-derived FFs work well for many simple systems, they often fail to describe interactions in more complex porous materials.  Since first-principles quantum mech. (QM) approaches are capable of accurately predicting intermol. interactions, deriving FFs from QM data without exptl. input is a promising soln.  In this paper, we review recent developments in deriving first-principles FFs for mols. in a variety of nanoporous materials.  We summarize and classify the methodologies used in these studies, and discuss the factors that are responsible for the accuracy and reliability of FFs.

Previous modeling studies have shown that these interactions are not adequately modeled when literature force-field parameters are used.  Typical results of grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations exhibit a pronounced underestimation of the hydrogen uptake at low pressures and low temps.  In this study, it is shown that this shortcoming can be resolved by deriving a new set of potential parameters to represent the metal-dihydrogen interaction from ab initio calcns. for mol. model systems.  The approach is computationally efficient and could be applied for any coordination environment of the metal center.  The present work focuses on three MOFs with unsatd. copper centers.  The newly derived Cu-H2 potential model is combined with literature force-field parameters to model the dispersive interactions with other framework atoms.  At cryogenic temps. and pressures up to 1 bar, GCMC simulations using these parameters provide for a massively improved prediction of the hydrogen storage characteristics when compared to parameters from a literature force field.  On the other hand, the unmodified literature parameters perform best in predicting the satn. uptake.  At room temp., the effect of the potential modification is much smaller, and the best agreement with expt. is obtained when the localized metal-dihydrogen interaction is not accounted for in the simulations.  This indicates that the metal-dihydrogen interaction is too weak to permit a significant adsorption at the metal sites under these conditions.  Calcns. using an artificially enhanced potential model show that a drastic increase of the interaction strength could boost the hydrogen storage capacity at room temp., although the attainable uptake remains limited by the no. of available metal sites.

(MOFs) and zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) by mol. simulation, accurate description of the van der Waals (vdW) and Coulomb interactions is undoubtedly the most crit. component.  However, there have been some strong recent indications that the use of generic force fields (FFs) widely used in most current CO2/MOF simulations that were not particularly parametrized for CO2/MOF and ZIF systems could lead to serious discrepancies compared with exptl. results.  Here, the authors develop accurate vdW FFs for CO2 uptake simulations in MOFs and ZIFs using high-level ab initio calcns., and validate the method by comparing the simulated and exptl. CO2 uptakes for various known MOFs and ZIFs.  The agreements between simulations and expts. are shown to be excellent for several known MOFs and ZIFs, although the FF parameters are not specifically fitted to those particular systems, showing the potential transferability of the FF.  Atomic charges of the adsorbents are computed via the rapid charge equilibration method.  Using these highly accurate FFs, the origin of the enhanced CO2 uptake in recently reported MOFs having multivariate functional groups (MTV-MOFs) is revealed.  The capacity enhancement in MTV-MOFs arises from an increase in both vdW (due to tighter geometry) and electrostatic (due to increased dipole moment) interactions between CO2 and MTV-MOF.  The authors predict that MOF-5-NO2 can have an even higher CO2 uptake than these MTV-MOFs due to a larger local dipole moment of the NO2-functionalized linker than those found in the reported MTV-MOFs.  As a further design of high capacity material, the authors then introduced both electron-donating and -withdrawing functional groups simultaneously in the same org. linker to increase the local dipole moment of the linker significantly.  The resulting CO2 uptake indeed increases substantially due to the favorable electrostatic interactions that can be tested exptl.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhtlSksrjK&md5=bfadbc5853ddfbb10ddf1dd971e0dbdd", "40.

A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common d. functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported.  The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on std. thermochem. benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked arom. mols. and group II element clusters, and for the computation of mol. geometries.  Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for std. functionals.  In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean abs. deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1.  The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the av. CCSD(T) accuracy.  The basic strategy in the development to restrict the d. functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interat. distances by damped C6\u00b7R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions.  As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference.

The authors investigated the physisorption of benzene, as a probe mol. for larger guest mols., within the matrix of MOF-5 using high-level quantum mech. methods.  The calcns. reveal a large contribution of dispersion effects on the host-guest interaction.  The importance of both reliable and efficient quantum mech. techniques, which are able to properly cover these effects, is discussed.  A double-hybrid functional together with an empirical long-range dispersion correction is an accurate and robust method for the rather large model systems.

Apart from its general applicability, the program has been designed to generate force fields for metal-org. frameworks in an automated fashion.  The force field parameters for the covalent interaction are derived from ab initio data.  The math. expression of the covalent energy is kept simple to ensure robustness and to avoid fitting deficiencies as much as possible.  The user needs to produce an equil. structure and a Hessian matrix for one or more building units.  Afterward, a force field is generated for the system using a three-step method implemented in QuickFF.  The first two steps of the methodol. are designed to minimize correlations among the force field parameters.  In the last step, the parameters are refined by imposing the force field parameters to reproduce the ab initio Hessian matrix in Cartesian coordinate space as accurate as possible.  The method is applied on a set of 1000 org. mols. to show the easiness of the software protocol.  To illustrate its application to metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), QuickFF is used to det. force fields for MIL-53(Al) and MOF-5.  For both materials, accurate force fields were already generated in literature but they requested a lot of manual interventions.  QuickFF is a tool that can easily be used by anyone with a basic knowledge of performing ab initio calcns.  As a result, accurate force fields are generated with minimal effort.  \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2MXkvVaitL4%253D&md5=47ac6aba7153559b2c42cd28633259ad", "52.

The compd. was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction, TGA, IR and BET method.  This compd. is isostructural to the MIL-53 type, previously obsd. with the trivalent cations Cr, Fe, Al, In.  It exhibits a three-dimensional metal-org. framework built up from infinite chains of trans corner-sharing GaO4(OH)2 octahedra (via \u03bc2-hydroxo bonds) linked to each other through the terephthalate linkers.  It gave lozenge-shaped channel structure running parallel to the infinite files of Ga-centered octahedra.  After activation, the compd. is able to adsorb one molar equivalent of H2O at room temp. under ambient air (MIL-53(Ga){H2O}).  Different H bond interactions are obsd. for the encapsulated H2O within the channels.  In one tunnel, pairs of H2O species with strong H-bond interactions were obsd. whereas in the adjacent tunnel, only a continuous linear and weakly H bonded network occurs.  The dehydrated form was obtained upon heating the MIL-53(Ga) solid at 80\u00b0 together with the shrinkage of the channels in MIL-53(Ga)_lt.

The BET surface area was 1140 \u00b1 114 m2 g-1.  The phase transitions were characterized by IR spectroscopy at different temps., which confirms the stability domain of the narrow close form (specific band at 1016 cm-1) of MIL-53(Ga) and then the pore opening (shifted band toward 1024 cm-1) together with the structure collapse.

The method has for the first time been shown to predict successfully both temp.-dependent structural changes and the structural response to variable sorbate uptake of a flexible MOF.  AIMD employing dispersion-cor. d. functional theory accurately simulated the exptl. obsd. closure of MIL-53(Sc) upon solvent removal and the transition of the empty MOF from the closed-pore phase to the very-narrow-pore phase (symmetry change from P21/c to C2/c) with increasing temp., indicating that it can directly take into account entropic as well as enthalpic effects.  The authors also used AIMD simulations to mimic the CO2 adsorption of MIL-53(Sc) in silico by allowing the MIL-53(Sc) framework to evolve freely in response to CO2 loadings corresponding to the two steps in the exptl. adsorption isotherm.  The resulting structures enabled the structure detn. of the two CO2-contg. intermediate and large-pore phases obsd. by exptl. synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies with increasing CO2 pressure; this would not have been possible for the intermediate structure via conventional methods because of diffraction peak broadening.  Furthermore, the strong and anisotropic peak broadening obsd. for the intermediate structure could be explained in terms of fluctuations of the framework predicted by the AIMD simulations.  Fundamental insights from the mol.-level interactions further revealed the origin of the breathing of MIL-53(Sc) upon temp. variation and CO2 adsorption.

Flexible MOFs combine the cryst. order of the underlying coordination network with cooperative structural transformability.  These materials can respond to phys. and chem. stimuli of various kinds in a tunable fashion by mol. design, which does not exist for other known solid-state materials.  Among the fascinating properties are so-called breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host-guest interactions.  Phase transitions are triggered by guest adsorption/desorption, photochem., thermal, and mech. stimuli.  Other important flexible properties of MOFs, such as linker rotation and sub-net sliding, which are not necessarily accompanied by crystallog. phase transitions, are briefly mentioned as well.  Emphasis is given on reviewing the recent progress in application of in situ characterization techniques and the results of theor. approaches to characterize and understand the breathing mechanisms and phase transitions.  The flexible MOF systems, which are discussed, are categorized by the type of metal-nodes involved and how their coordination chem. with the linker mols. controls the framework dynamics.

The authors present the first theor. investigation of the stability of MOF polymorphs under solvothermal conditions.  The authors combined thermodn. integration (TI) and osmotic framework adsorbed soln. theory (OFAST) calcns. to reliably predict the free energy of immersion, \u0394Gimm, of MOFs.  The configurational free energy can be estd. in the harmonic approxn. from the vibrational d. of states (VDOS) of the framework.  This approach is applied to a set of hypothetical Zn(mIm)2 polymorphs under ambient conditions using methanol as the solvent to mimic the actual solvothermal synthesis conditions for ZIF-8.  The simulations predict that the relative contribution of \u0394Gimm to the framework stability is minor compared with the configurational free energy relative to the most stable structure for all polymorphs.  However, solvation affects the energetic ordering of metastable polymorphs.  The authors obsd. good agreement between predictions of \u0394Gimm using the OFAST method and those using the more rigorous TI calcns.  The methods developed in this work can be applied to study the effect of the interplay between structural topol., solvent, and temp. on the thermodn. stability of the framework for a wide range of nanoporous materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhsVOhurjN&md5=364b4bd80b30ae822033e7314f596714"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0012.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0013.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0014.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0015.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0016.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2015/langd5.2015.31.issue-30/acs.langmuir.5b01193/20150729/images/small/la-2015-01193p_0017.gif\">"]}
