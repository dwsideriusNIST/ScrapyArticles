In view of the former TPD information, the behaviors of adsorption and volumetric measurements reported herein are straightforwardly interpreted. The combined TPD, adsorption isotherms, and dead volume data deepen the understanding of the physicochemical nature of adsorbed gas, where gas adsorption in the vicinity of pore constrictions and/or apertures as well as on the inner surface areas of pores and/or cages could be resolved. Previous conclusions that the huge activation energies measured for Ne/CMSF at high temperatures are unlikely to characterize chemical desorption but reflect those required for overcoming the barrier of effectively constricted apertures were confirmed by the volumetric data presented here.

In all cases, a bowl-ended Pyrex tube containing the solid substance was connected to the vacuum system via a glass metal fitting flange. Zeolites were measured following evacuation between RT (hydrated) and up to full dryness at 300 \u00b0C. The temperature of the CMSF was progressively elevated (by 100 \u00b0C intervals) following each measurement. Dead volume measurements utilized pressures in the 1\u22121000 Torr range, measured with a highly sensitive pressure transducer (Sensotec, model Super TJE, 0.05% FS), calibrated to an accuracy of \u00b10.1 Torr. Adsorption isotherms of Ne/A zeolites and Ne/CMSF were performed at 77 K, utilizing pressures of up to 3000 Torr and measured with a MKS Baratron gauge (122AA). The He isotherm was exceptionally determined in a high-pressure system (", "P", "max", " = 200 atm). To determine the He isotherm, a different approach had to be taken in the sense that the dead volume was deuced indirectly, using He as hereby explained. Initially, volume calibration was performed for an empty stainless steel container at RT and at 77 K (by immersion in LN", "2", "). This was done versus pressure, including the high-pressure region, to rule out the possible occurrence of He\u2212He interactions. For the isotherm, the dry 5A sample was chosen because both of its cages are accessible for He accommodation regardless of whether ", "T", " \u2265 77 K.", "7", " With this sample in the container, volume calibration was undertaken at RT to ensure as little adsorption of He as possible. This measurement approximated the volume occupied by the 5A skeleton. Since both kinds of windows in this grade are opened to He atoms at 77 K as well as at RT, the volume of the zeolitic skeleton at 77 K was approximated by correcting that measured at RT by the temperatures ratio (298/77). The He isotherm was then determined at 77 K. The effective dead volume was taken as the difference between the volume of the empty container measured at 77 K and the above 77 K-corrected RT-measured volume of the zeolitic skeleton. Care was taken to keep a constant LN", "2", " height during the measurement. Since 5A offers pore accessibility even at 77 K, no kinetic effect of gas penetration was manifested and equilibrium pressures were quickly attained. ", " ", "A final remark concerning the choice of samples weights is in place. In the case of the crystalline zeolites, large sample weights should be carefully considered to account for a possible degradation of the zeolitic lattice upon contact with water vapor during the process of dehydration. Since the extent of water content strongly affects both the effective free aperture dimension and the free surface area (outer and inner) that is available for adsorption, samples of different evacuation (dehydration) temperatures will accordingly manifest different sensitivities to the measured quantity of interest. Thus, sample weights that will result in acceptable sensitivities and highly reproducible data were strictly chosen. Following this guideline, samples with relatively large adsorption capacities, i.e., 5A (190 \u00b0C), 5A (300 \u00b0C), and 4A (300 \u00b0C), were utilized in small quantities of \u223c650 mg. On the other hand, larger quantities were required for samples that offer a smaller available surface area for adsorption:\u2009 weights between 4.7 and 5.3 g were used in the case of 3, 4, and 5A pre-evacuated at RT and 3A and 5A, respectively, dehydrated at 300 and 100 \u00b0C. When samples are evacuated only at RT, weights are insignificant with respect to the possible occurrence of degradation during dehydration. In all other cases, including small and large sample weights, care was taken to minimize such possible effects by initially dehydrating the samples over a slow temperature ramp in a capacious oven with constant air circulation with the sample inside a wide container. The same measures were taken in extreme cases like dead volume measurements using He, where even larger weights of \u223c32 g were required to gain fair detection sensitivities. Whatever sample weight was utilized, all samples behaved both qualitatively and quantitatively, as expected from the classification procedure that relied on the former TPD experiments, which due to their high sensitivity required only small zeolite quantities of \u223c300 mg. Finally, in the case of amorphous CMSF, for which such considerations are not of concern, 0.2\u22121.6 g was utilized in all experiments.

The latter one (dry 3A) is particularly interesting since, although fully dried, at 77 K (the temperature of the isotherm) it possesses an overly small effective free aperture dimension which is reflected in turn by the small adsorbed amount.

Isotherms in panel b are of samples with practically closed zeolitic cages and constricted CMSF constrictions.", " ", " ", " ", "The isotherms of Figure 3b, i.e., those of zeolites with practically closed windows, produce nearly linear isotherms with minute amounts of adsorbed gas, as can be expected from highly reduced pore accessibility:\u2009 the more restricted the aperture, the less accessible the inner pore volume. It may be seen (Figure 3b) that among the zeolites, the adsorbed amount increases in a systematic order from 3A to 5A via 4A. This behavior is in accord with the free available inner cage volumes and their respective inner surface areas. A closer inspection of the isotherms reveals, however, the occurrence of the reversed effect in the low-pressure region, in the sense that the more restricted the aperture the larger the adsorbed amount. This observation is illustrated by the inset of Figure 3b that shows a magnification of the low-pressure region of the isotherms of the hydrated samples. Such a behavior may be understood if low-energy sites, occurring at the effectively constricted zeolitic apertures, are considered. In that case, the more constricted the aperture, the better it fits the dimension of the guest atom. This creates a source of low-energy sites", "16", " that increases in turn the adsorbed amount. That the effectively constricted zeolitic apertures dominate the isotherm behavior for hydrated samples at low pressures is further supported by the fact that at these low pressures the isotherms of the two 5A samples (RT and 100 \u00b0C) are practically indistinguishable (regular and inverted triangles in the inset of Figure 3b) regardless of their different extents of hydration. At higher pressures, however, the gas manages to access the inner surface area of cages to growing extents, as compared with the low-energy sites near the apertures. In that case, the energetic sites occurring in larger quantities on the inner surface of the zeolitic cages govern the relative adsorbed amount. As a result, the relative order of isotherms (Figure 3b) returns to that expected from growing inner available surface area of cages, i.e., from 3A to 5A via 4A. In a summary of the isotherm measurements, it should be noted that their results comply with the initial sample classification that purely relied on independent TPD measurements. Since in contrast to isotherm measurements, those of TPD are of a nonequilibrium character, the isotherm measurements can be viewed as being complementary to the TPD data in the sense that they confirm the initial TPD classification of aperture closure versus temperature and water content. ", " ", "In view of the effect of temperature on the closure status of cages and constrictions in A zeolites and CMSF, respectively, the physicochemical nature of encapsulated gas was explored by dead volume (", "V", "d", ") measurements. At RT, the O", "8", " windows in dehydrated 3A are widely opened, providing free He access to the inner volume of \u03b1 cages, whereas the smaller O", "6", " windows are practically closed, thus hindering \u03b2 accessibility (see Table 1). Similarly, at LN", "2", " \u03b1 cages in 3A become practically inaccessible for 1 bar of He due to a significant thermal contraction of their aperture. Relying on the TPD information given above, we performed two conditioned dead volume measurements, dried 3A at LN", "2", " and RT, to extract the available \u03b1 cage volume.

We measured a small amount of Ne adsorbed on the external surface of the porous materials, whereas marked adsorbed quantities of either Ne or He were observed in the inner surface area of pores. In the case of He, the adsorption was reflected in the measurement of abnormal dead volumes, thus warranting the realization that in cases concerning porous materials, volumetrically deduced quantities should not be taken for granted, but be carefully considered and uniquely interpreted in relation to the specific experimental conditions under which they are taken.

The effect of dehydration on the effective free aperture dimension, Df, is studied by utilizing temp.-programmed decapsulation of He and Ne.  The interplay between the various known mechanisms governing Df is directly sensed by the decapsulation behavior of differently sized inert atoms.  The results are qual. interpreted using pure dimensional considerations, revealing the occurrence of a strict relation between the content of water mols. and the redistribution of zeolitic cations in detg.

It is proposed that Df is regulated via a subtle balance between two coupled principal mechanisms.  One involves direct lattice adjustments, where two opposite sub-mechanisms seem to play competitive roles.  Removal of water mols. by simultaneous heating and pumping enlarges Df, while hydroxyl groups elimination from within the zeolitic channels results in their partial collapse, thus reducing Df.  The second mechanism involves the regulation of aperture blocking via relocations of the counterions initiated by increasing vacancies due to removal of water mols.  While dehydration continuously contracts the O6 apertures, a two-stage effect is obsd. for the wider O8 windows.  Upon dehydration at large water contents, O8 apertures are reduced; then, beyond a crit. extent of dehydration, the net effect is reversed, widening the O8 windows.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXoslWitL8%253D&md5=d2190a9b598061b2e4f8c349a50ee567", " ", " ", "(9)", "\u2002", "Barrer, R.
