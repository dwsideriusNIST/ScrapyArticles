Irradn. at either 365 or 400 nm results in postsynthetic deprotection (PSD), removing the nitrobenzyl protecting groups from these ligands and generating phenolic groups in the pores of the MOF (55-83% yield).  The photochem. behavior of the ligands in the IRMOFs was not wholly predicted by their reactivity in soln. (i.e. free ligand).  A mixed ligand approach was used, by combining L1 or L2 with NH2-BDC to produce mixed ligand IRMOFs with 30-40% incorporation of the NH2-BDC.  These mixed-ligand IRMOFs were then subjected to both postsynthetic modification (PSM) and PSD.  Two routes to achieve both PSM and PSD were explored: PSM followed by PSD (route 1) and PSD followed by PSM (route 2).  When using 365 nm light for the PSD reaction, route 1 was superior due to absorption of NH2-BDC at 365 nm.  Irradn. at 400 nm gave fewer differences between route 1 and route 2, but the PSD reaction was less efficient (30-40%) for all systems.  By combining PSD and PSM, MOFs with highly functionalized pores can be obtained through a combination of pre- and postsynthetic methods.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XmtlGgsrw%253D&md5=9e02cb8ffcaa3ce4464a3e9f1a238604", "(c) ", "Tuci", ", ", "G.", "; ", "Rossin", ", ", "A.", "; ", "Xu", ", ", "X.", "; ", "Ranocchiari", ", ", "M.", "; ", "van Bokhoven", ", ", "J.

The high capacity and selectivity are consequences of the exceptionally large isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, calcd. to be -96 kJ mol-1 at zero coverage.  IR spectra support chemisorption between amines and CO2 as one of the primary mechanisms of uptake.  Despite the large initial heat of adsorption, the CO2 uptake was fully reversible and the framework could be easily regenerated at 60\u00b0, enabling a cycling time of just 27 min with no loss of capacity over 72 adsorption/desorption cycles.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhtFagtrzM&md5=eeb691022dc2b81537158452bbc9f11c"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0012.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cmatex/2014/cmatex.2014.26.issue-4/cm404239s/production/images/small/cm-2013-04239s_0011.gif\">"]}
