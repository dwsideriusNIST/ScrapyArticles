It is a nondestructive and global measurement and is very sensitive, especially for the first stages of physisorption, whose reliability is shown by the agreement with the results obtained with calorimetric measurements. Adsorption volumetry is particularly well adapted for the study of nanotubes since fractions of their surface are uniform enough for physisorption of simple molecules to give rise to stepwise isotherms. Nevertheless, it does not allow precise conclusions concerning the nature of the adsorption sites on these quasi-uniform fractions of the surface. ", " ", "We may question whether the isotherm steps originate from adsorption on metal impurities, amorphous carbon or other impurities, or actually on nanotubes, on which several types of sites can be imagined, such as inside or outside isolated nanotubes, between nanotubes associated in bundles, or on the outside part of the bundles. Some of these can probably be ruled out. Metal particles are not accessible, since they are embedded in amorphous carbon. Amorphous carbon should not give rise to stepwise isotherms. The access inside the nanotubes is not possible, since they are closed at both ends. The following argument suggests that the first step corresponds to the adsorption in the curved triangular channels located between nanotubes into the bundles and the second on the outside surface of the bundles. The number of nanotubes forming bundles in our sample is usually found to lie between 30 and 50, in agreement with TEM observations.", "20,21", " With the value of 37, taken within these limits and which allows the calculation for a perfectly hexagonal section of the bundles, assuming that all the carbon atoms of the sample are involved in the nanotubes, we estimate a cumulative interstitial channel length of 4.5 \u00d7 10", "11", " m g", "-", "1", ", with the nanotube diameter and distance given above. If the methane molecules adsorbed in these channels form \u201c1D lines\u201d, equalling the distance between two methane molecules to that in a (111) plane of the bulk crystal, (4.17 \u00c5), we can estimate, from the methane adsorption capacity, an equivalent surface area of 160 m", "2", " g", "-", "1", ". Moreover, taking into account the molecular cross section of methane, the accessible external surface area of the bundles is about 210 m", "2", " g", "-", "1", ". The ratio between the total equivalent surface area (inside the channels and outside the bundles) and that inside the channels is thus 2.3, which is equal to the experimental ratio (2.3). It should be noticed that the adsorbed amount is expected to increase much more quickly inside than outside with increasing the number of nanotubes in a bundle, the choice of 37 nanotubes being a crude approximation. On the other hand, with a less perfect arrangement, the external surface area should be larger than that of bundles involving the same number of nanotubes. Nevertheless, as a first approximation, this model seems reasonable to interpret our results as representing successive adsorption into the interstitial channels and on the outside part of the bundles.The value of the equivalent specific surface area deduced from the adsorbed amount at the top of the first isotherm step (90 m", "2", " g", "-", "1", ") is smaller than that calculated for the interstitial adsorption sites in the bundles (160 m", "2", " g", "-", "1", ") by a factor of 0.6. This discrepancy is very likely to originate from the impurities (carbon and metal particles), which have already been mentioned in the sample description. Adsorption on these impurities is probably responsible for the slope of the plateau between the two isotherm steps", ".", " The identification of the adsorption sites should open new perspectives for fundamental investigations of the physisorption properties.

By analyzing the temp. variation of the effects in the present work and in that at lower temps. by others, a simple relation is obtained which shows that the thermal transpiration effects at an arbitrary temp. can be described by a single reduced curve.  The available data on He, Xe, O2, and N2 are analyzed in order to predict the temp. variation of the thermal transpiration effects.  Since there are simple relations between the values of consts. in the empirical equation and mol. collision diams., one can calc. the thermal transpiration values for gases for which no exptl. data are available.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaF2cXivVU%253D&md5=e5f30779a2d969e4dedd405ce0e7320a", " ", " ", "(24)", "\u2002", "Grillet, Y.; Rouquerol, F.; Rouquerol, J.
