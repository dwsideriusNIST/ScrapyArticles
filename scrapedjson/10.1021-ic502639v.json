Like carboxylate species the phosphonate binds via displacement of hydroxo and aqua ligands and chelation of a terminal Zr(IV) of the MOF node by a pair of oxygen atoms, as demonstrated in part by changes in DRIFTS spectra. Phosphonates are, as expected, significantly more strongly interacting with the hexa-zirconium nodes than are carboxylates. Indeed, if the phosphonate is introduced in excess (i.e., beyond four PPAs per node), significant linker loss and MOF degradation occur, presumably by displacement of the carboxylate-terminated linker by the phosphonate. Nevertheless, if stoichiometric or substoichiometric amounts of PPA are used, the amount of ligand installed can be reliably controlled. The resulting modified materials are characterized by only small changes in pore diameter, pore volume, and BET surface area and little change in PXRD pattern. The difference in coordination strength between phosphonates and carboxylates can be exploited to achieve stepwise incorporation of pairs of ligands\u2014specifically, phosphonates species followed by carboxylate species\u2014without danger of displacement of the first ligand type by the second.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.

Ion conduction and transport in solids are both interesting and useful and are found in widely distinct materials, from those in battery-related technologies to those in biol. systems.  Scientists have approached the synthesis of ion-conductive compds. in a variety of ways, in the areas of org. and inorg. chem.  Recently, based on their ion-conducting behavior, porous coordination polymers (PCPs) and metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) were recognized for their easy design and the dynamic behavior of the ionic components in the structures.  These PCP/MOFs consist of metal ions (or clusters) and org. ligands structured via coordination bonds.  They could have highly concd. mobile ions with dynamic behavior, and their characteristics have inspired the design of a new class of ion conductors and transporters.  In this Account, the authors describe the state-of-the-art of studies of ion cond. by PCP/MOFs and nonporous coordination polymers (CPs) and offer future perspectives.  PCP/MOF structures tend to have high hydrophilicity and guest-accessible voids, and scientists have reported many water-mediated proton (H+) conductivities.  Chem. modification of org. ligands can change the hydrated H+ cond. over a wide range.  However, the designable structures also permit water-free (anhyd.) H+ cond.  The incorporation of protic guests such as imidazole and 1,2,4-triazole into the microchannels of PCP/MOFs promotes the dynamic motion of guest mols., resulting in high H+ conduction without water.  Not only the host-guest systems, but the embedding of protic org. groups on CPs also results in inherent H+ cond.  The authors obsd. high H+ conductivities under anhyd. conditions and in the intermediate temp. region of org. and inorg. conductors.  The keys to successful construction are highly mobile ionic species and appropriate intervals of ion-hopping sites in the structures.  Lithium (Li+) and other ions can also be transported.  If the authors can optimize the crystal structures, this could offer further improvements in terms of both cond. and the working temp. range.  Another useful characteristic of PCP/MOFs is their wide application to materials fabrication.  The authors can easily prep. heterodomain crystal systems, such as core-shell or solid soln.  Other anisotropic morphologies (thin film, nanocrystal, nanorod, etc.,) are also possible, with retention of the ion cond.  The flexible nature also lets the authors design morphol.-dependent ion-conduction behaviors that the authors cannot observe in the bulk state.  The authors propose (1) multivalent ion and anion conductions with the aid of redox activity and defects in structures, (2) control of ion transport behavior by applying external stimuli, (3) anomalous cond. at the hetero-solid-solid interface, and (4) unidirectional ion transport as in the ion channels in membrane proteins.  In the future, scientists may use coordination polymers not only to achieve higher cond. but also to control ion behavior, which will open new avenues in solid-state ionics.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXosFynsLo%253D&md5=826f3cfe1126835b7cdcef5955e65c47", "(d) ", "Shimizu", ", ", "G.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous materials with many potential applications, which intimately depend on the presence of chem. functionality either at the org. linkers and/or at the metal nodes.  Functionality that cannot be introduced into MOFs directly via de novo syntheses can be accessed through post-synthesis modification (PSM) on the reactive moieties of the linkers and/or nodes without disrupting the metal-linker bonds.  Even more intriguing methods that go beyond PSM are herein termed building block replacement (BBR) which encompasses (i) solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE), (ii) nonbridging ligand replacement, and (iii) transmetalation.  These 1-step or tandem BBR processes involve exchanging key structural components of the MOF, which in turn should allow for the evolution of protoMOF structures (i.e., the use of a parent MOF as a template) to design MOFs composed of completely new components, presumably via single crystal to single crystal transformations.  The influence of building block replacement on the stability and properties of MOFs are discussed, and some insights into their mechanistic aspects are provided.

However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.

Using high-resoln. neutron power diffraction technique, we found the first direct structural evidence showing that real UiO-66 material contains significant amt. of missing-linker defects, an unusual phenomenon for MOFs.  The concn. of the missing-linker defects is surprisingly high, \u223c10% in our sample, effectively reducing the framework connection from 12 to \u223c11.  We show that by varying the concn. of the acetic acid modulator and the synthesis time, the linker vacancies can be tuned systematically, leading to dramatically enhanced porosity.  We obtained samples with pore vols. ranging from 0.44 to 1.0 cm3/g and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas ranging from 1000 to 1600 m2/g, the largest values of which are \u223c150% and \u223c60% higher than the theor. values of defect-free UiO-66 crystal, resp.  The linker vacancies also have profound effects on the gas adsorption behaviors of UiO-66, in particular CO2.  Finally, comparing the gas adsorption of hydroxylated and dehydroxylated UiO-66, we found that the former performs systematically better than the latter (particularly for CO2) suggesting the beneficial effect of the -OH groups.  This finding is of great importance because hydroxylated UiO-66 is the practically more relevant, non-air-sensitive form of this MOF.

The BET anal. is the std. method for detg. surface areas from nitrogen adsorption isotherms and was originally derived for multilayer gas adsorption onto flat surfaces.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of cryst., porous materials that exhibit very large BET surface areas.  These materials are microporous and possess surfaces that are far from flat.  In some MOFs, adsorption occurs through a pore-filling mechanism rather than by layer formation.  Thus, it is unclear whether BET surface area nos. reported for these materials are truly meaningful.  Given the std. practice of reporting BET surface areas for novel porous materials, a crit. test of the BET method is much needed.  Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict adsorption isotherms for nitrogen in MOFs.  The predicted isotherms were used as pseudoexperimental data to test the applicability of the BET theory for obtaining surface areas of microporous MOFs.  BET surface areas calcd. from the simulated isotherms agree very well with the accessible surface areas calcd. directly from the crystal structures in a geometric fashion.

(poly)phosphonates are additives in water treatment that find broad use as mineral scale and corrosion inhibitors for a plethora of industrial applications.  The phenomenon of pptn. of scale inhibitors was studied intensively.  This study reports the synthesis, characterization, and crystal structure of [Ca(AMP)(H2O)]\u00b73.5H2O (H2AMP = Amino-tris-Methylene Phosphonic acid).  Ca-AMP crystals are monoclinic, space group P21/n with a 11.3382(5), b 8.4555(4), c 15.5254(7) \u00c5, \u03b2 90.6551\u00b0 and Z = 4.  The structure is polymeric due to chelation of multiple Ca ions by AMP.  The Ca2+ center is slightly distorted octahedral and is surrounded by five phosphonate oxygens and a water mol.  Ca-O(P) bond lengths range from 2.2924(14) to 2.3356(14) \u00c5.  The Ca-O(H2O) bond distance is 2.3693(17).  Each phosphonate group is monodeprotonated, and the nitrogen atom is protonated.
