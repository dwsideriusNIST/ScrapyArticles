The roll-up of N", "2", " observed experimentally is much higher than the one predicted by the model.

A multipurpose exptl. setup was designed and constructed to perform these expts.  The pressure drop and axial dispersion were very high in the adsorption column.  Darcy's equation and the correlation by G. Langer et al.(1978) were recalibrated to account for the increased pressure drop and enhanced axial dispersion, resp.  With these recalibrated constituent models, the numerical process model, solved using COMSOL Multiphysics software, was able to correctly capture the measured exptl. breakthrough and PPSA performance results.  The principal conclusion from this study is that the high axial dispersion and pressure drop in a column packed with very fine 5A zeolite particles are due to the surface roughness and clustering of the particles and channeling in the column, which are detrimental to the performance of the PPSA process.  Therefore, the max. oxygen product purity obtained in a simple two-step PPSA process was limited to < 40%.

Besides of the 100% active adsorption matter such material exhibits an advantageous secondary pore system.  In this paper a more detailed investigation of the structure and the generation thereof is presented.  To characterize the pore structure of the system SEM, EDX, Hg-porosimetry, as well as adsorption measurements (N2 and CO2) were used.  For addnl. investigations XRD and XRF were applied.  As a result of the special manufg. process - granulation of zeolite NaMSX powder with metakaolin/caustic under high energy input followed by an alk. treatment - two different types of zeolite morphologies were obtained: On the outer surface of the beads typical octahedral zeolite X crystals are monitored as a result of conventional and epitaxial crystal growth.  In contrast the interior of the beads exhibits polycryst. structures consisting of zeolite X in untypical shape, which is most probably the result of zeolite formation in dense matter.  Due to the confined space conventional and epitaxial growth is inhibited.  Obviously the original zeolite crystals are intergrown by polycryst. zeolite NaMSX matter originated from converted metakaolin, and by the way forming macro pores.  Said structure formation is the cause for the surprisingly high mech. stability of the binderless shaped bodies.  The existence of the superior secondary pore system and the high mech. stability of binderless type NaMSX shapes can be explained as result of different pathways of the conversion of metakaolin into zeolite matter due to the existence of areas of different densities after the granulation process.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xjt1GmtLc%253D&md5=2b33a04ba536d79b67973faefcbf082f", "28.

These relations originate from the Gibbs adsorption equation.  It is necessary to measure the surface excess of the components of the binary gas mixt. as functions of pressure at const. gas phase compn. and temp., as functions of gas phase compns. at const. pressure and temp., and as functions of temp. at const. gas phase compns. and pressures, to apply these tests practically.  The tests are very useful to check the quality of the data before they can be extrapolated for adsorptive process design using multicomponent equil. adsorption models.  A set of pure and binary gas data for adsorption of CH4 and N2 on a 5A zeolite was used to demonstrate the applicability of these consistency tests, and the data are consistent by all tests.  Some of these tests could not be applied previously because of a lack of sufficient data.  Published pure and binary gas adsorption equil. data sets on various microporous adsorbents of practical interest, which passed the integral thermodn. consistency test, is listed.  They can be used to validate theor. models for prediction or correlation of multicomponent adsorption data.  The criteria for obeying the thermodn. consistency tests by several anal. pure and multicomponent gas adsorption models (Langmuir, Nitta et al., Toth, and Martinez and Basmadjian) are derived.
