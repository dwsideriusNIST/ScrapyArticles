Post-combustion CO2 capture from the flue gas is one of the key technol. options to reduce greenhouse gases, because this can be potentially retrofitted to the existing fleet of coal-fired power stations.  Adsorption processes using solid sorbents capable of capturing CO2 from flue gas streams have shown many potential advantages, compared to other conventional CO2 capture using aq. amine solvents.  In view of this, in the past few years, several research groups have been involved in the development of new solid sorbents for CO2 capture from flue gas with superior performance and desired economics.  A variety of promising sorbents such as activated carbonaceous materials, microporous/mesoporous silica or zeolites, carbonates, and polymeric resins loaded with or without nitrogen functionality for the removal of CO2 from the flue gas streams have been reviewed.  Different methods of impregnating functional groups, including grafting techniques and modifying the support materials, have been discussed to enhance the performance of the sorbents.  The performance characteristics of the solid sorbents are assessed in terms of various desired attributes, such as their equil. adsorption capacity, selectivity, regeneration, multicycle durability, and adsorption/desorption kinetics.  The potential of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) is also recognized to det. whether these novel materials provide better CO2 adsorption capacity under low CO2 partial pressure.  A comprehensive crit. review and anal. of the literature on this subject has been carried out to update the recent progress in this arena.  A comparison of different solid sorbents at different stages is made.  A review.  It also includes a brief review on techno-economic anal. and design aspects of sorbent bed contactor configuration.

Exptl. measurements were carried out on the intelligent gravimetric analyzer (IGA-003, Hiden).  Carbon dioxide adsorption capacity of 909 mg g-1 has been achieved in ACB-5 at 298 K and 18 bar, which is superior to the existing carbonaceous porous materials and comparable to metal-org. framework (MOF)-177 (1232 mg g-1, at 298 K and 20 bar) and covalent-org. framework (COF)-102 (1050 mg g-1 at 298 K and 20 bar) reported in the literature.  Moreover, methane uptake reaches 15.23 wt % in ACB-5 at 298 K and 18 bar, which is better than MOF-5.  To predict the performances of the samples ACB-2 and ACB-5 at high pressures, modeling of the samples and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation have been conducted, as is presented in our previous work.  The adsorption isotherms of CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 in our samples ACB-2 and 5 have been measured at 298 and 348 K and different compns., corresponding to the pre- and postcombustion conditions for CO2 capture.

Excess volumetric and gravimetric endohedral adsorptions of methane in the (15,15), (20, 20), (25, 25), and (30, 30) SWNT arrays were obtained.

The usable capacity ratio (UCR), which is defined as the mass of available fuel in an adsorbent-loaded vessel divided by the mass of available fuel in a vessel without adsorbent, was used as the criterion to judge the adsorption performance of SWNT arrays with different parameters.  Results indicate that the (15, 15) SWNT arrays with a VDW gap of \u0394 = 0.8 nm is the optimal adsorbent among all of the cases studied for methane storage at room temp.  At p = 4.1 M Pa, the total volumetric and gravimetric capacities (including endohedral and exohedral adsorption) of methane on the SWNT arrays with the optimal parameters reach 216 V/V and 215 g CH4/kg C, resp.

The attainment of the exciting result attributes to the optimization of the VDW gap parameter of SWNT arrays, because the adsorption of methane in the interstices surpasses 60% of the total amt. at the optimal condition, while its value is <15% of the total amt. at a VDW gap of \u0394 = 0.335 and p = 4.1 M Pa.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXovVShsLo%253D&md5=857a009a095fe06bc8572455e83c230c", "11.

Two types of binding sites for Na+ ions are identified in the framework.  Site I is in the single eight-membered ring, whereas site II is in the \u03b1-cage. Na+ ions at site I have a stronger affinity for the framework and thus a smaller mobility.  The binding sites in rho-ZMOF resemble those in its inorg. counterpart rho-zeolite. CO2 is adsorbed predominantly over other gases because of its strong electrostatic interactions with the charged framework and the presence of Na+ ions acting as addnl. adsorption sites.  At ambient temp. and pressure, the CO2 selectivities are 1800 for the CO2/H2 mixt., 80 for the CO2/CH4 mixt., and 500 for the CO2/N2 mixt.

This phenomenon stems from the fact that the Li atom has a strong affinity to the gas mols.  Also the COFs show a larger self-diffusivity than most of the metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), and the permselectivities of the COFs for H2/CH4 are 1 order of magnitude higher than the Li-doped COFs.

Among all the metals studied, Li, Sc, and Ti can bind with COFs stably, while Be, Mg, and Ca cannot, because the binding of Be, Mg, and Ca with COFs is very weak.  Also, Li, Sc, and Ti can improve the uptakes of CO2 in COFs significantly.  However, the binding energy of a CO2 mol. with Sc and Ti exceeds the lower limit of chemisorptions and, thus, suffers from the difficulty of desorption.  By the comparative studies above, Li is the best surface modifier of COFs for CO2 capture among all the metals studied.  Therefore, the authors further study the uptakes of CO2 in the Li-doped COFs.

Adsorption equil. and kinetics data for CO2, CH4, N2O, and N2 on all three adsorbents were measured volumetrically at 298K and gas pressures up to 800 Torr.  Adsorption equil. capacities of CO2 and CH4 on all three adsorbents were detd. gravimetrically at 298 K and elevated pressures (14 bar for CO2 and 100 bar for CH4).  The Henry's law and Langmuir adsorption equil. models were applied to correlate the adsorption isotherms, and a classical micropore diffusion model was used to analyze the adsorption kinetic data.  The adsorption equil. selectivity was calcd. from the ratio of Henry's consts., and the adsorbent selection parameter for pressure swing adsorption processes were detd. by combining the equil. selectivity and working capacity ratio.  Based on the selectivity and adsorbent selection parameter results, zeolite 5A is a better adsorbent for removing CO2 and N2O from air and sepn. of CO2 from CH4, whereas MOF-177 is the adsorbent of choice for removing CH4 from air.  However, both MOF adsorbents have larger adsorption capacities for CO2 and CH4 than zeolite 5A at elevated pressures, suggesting MOF-5 and MOF-177 are better adsorbents for CO2 and CH4 storage.  The CH4 adsorption capacity of 22 wt.% on MOF-177 at 298K and 100 bar is probably the largest adsorption uptake of CH4 on any dry adsorbents.  The av. diffusivity of CO2, CH4 and N2O in MOF-5 and MOF-177 is in the order of 10-9 m2/s, as compared to 10-11 m2/s for CO2, CH4 and N2O in zeolite 5A.
