Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.  Furthermore, gas sepns. in MOFs, including the mol. sieving effect, kinetic sepn., the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 sepn., and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXkvVamurY%253D&md5=cbb650af8ce92526fc8ffd870218bbd0", "2.
