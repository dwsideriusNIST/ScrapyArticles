The metathesis of metal centers from Zn(II) to Cu(II) on NPC-7-Zn can stabilize the porous framework and thus lead to permanent porosity.

Researchers have developed artificial metalloporphyrins, but these structures have had limited catalytic applications.  Homogeneous artificial metalloporphyrins can undergo catalytic deactivation via suicidal self-oxidn., which lowers their catalytic activity and sustainability relative to their counterparts in Nature.  Heme mols. in protein scaffolds can maintain high efficiency over numerous catalytic cycles.  Therefore, we wondered if immobilizing metalloporphyrin moieties within porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) could stabilize these structures and facilitate the mol. recognition of substrates and produce highly efficient biomimetic catalysis.  In this Account, we describe our research to develop multifunctional porphyrinic frameworks as highly efficient heterogeneous biomimetic catalysts.  Our studies indicate that porous porphyrinic frameworks provide an excellent platform for mimicking the activity of biocatalysts and developing new heterogeneous catalysts that effect new chem. transformations under mild conditions.  The porous structures and framework topologies of the porphyrinic frameworks depend on the configurations, coordination donors, and porphyrin metal ions of the metalloporphyrin moieties.  To improve the activity of porous porphyrinic frameworks, we have developed a two-step synthesis that introduces the functional polyoxometalates (POMs) into POM-porphyrin hybrid materials.  To tune the pore structures and the catalytic properties of porphyrinic frameworks, we have designed metalloporphyrin M-H8OCPP ligands with four m-benzenedicarboxylate moieties, and introduced the secondary auxiliary ligands.  The porphyrin metal ions and the secondary functional moieties that are incorporated into porous metal-org. frameworks greatly influence the catalytic properties and activities of porphyrinic frameworks in different reactions, such as the oxidn. of alkylbenzenes, olefins, and hexane and the photo-oxygenation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene and sulfides.  The porphyrin metal ions and the secondary auxiliary sites in the pores can work together synergistically to enhance the catalytic activities of porphyrinic frameworks.  Compared with their homogeneous counterparts, the activities and stabilities of the heterogeneous porphyrinic frameworks are remarkable: the immobilization of metalloporphyrins onto the pore surfaces of MOFs not only prevents their suicidal self-oxidn. but also allows them to activate inert substrate mols., such as cyclohexane.  Moreover, because the bulky mols. cannot easily access the active sites inside the pores of porphyrinic frameworks, these porous materials demonstrate interesting size-selective catalytic properties toward substrates.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXitVyiurw%253D&md5=d5c1e6b8f584d401939078d57d7f3a62", "6.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions/clusters coordinated by org. linkers (or bridging-ligands).  The hallmark of MOFs is their permanent porosity, which is frequently found in MOFs constructed from metal-clusters.  These clusters are often formed in situ, whereas the linkers are generally pre-formed.  The geometry and connectivity of a linker dictate the structure of the resulting MOF.  Adjustments of linker geometry, length, ratio, and functional-group can tune the size, shape, and internal surface property of a MOF for a targeted application.  In this crit. review, the authors highlight advances in MOF synthesis focusing on linker design.  Examples of building MOFs to reach unique properties, such as unprecedented surface area, pore aperture, mol. recognition, stability, and catalysis, through linker design are described.  Further search for application-oriented MOFs through judicious selection of metal clusters and org. linkers is desirable.  In this review, linkers are categorized as ditopic (Section 1), tritopic (Section 2), tetratopic (Section 3), hexatopic (Section 4), octatopic (Section 5), mixed (Section 6), desymmetrized (Section 7), metallo (Section 8), and N-heterocyclic linkers (Section 9).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXht1Slu7jK&md5=322785c0256204742e3e95e5d2d49914", "9.

Taylor, 2010).  The challenge of developing effective sepn. and purifn. technologies which have much smaller energy footprints is greater for CO2 than for other gases; in addn. to its involvement in climate change, CO2 is an impurity in natural gas, biogas (biomass-based natural gas), syngas (CO/H2, the main H2 source for refineries), and many other gas streams.  In the context of porous cryst. materials which can exploit equil. and kinetic selectivity, size selectivity and targeted mol. recognition are attractive characteristics for CO2 sepn. and capture, as exemplified by 5A and 13X zeolites (J.

This paper reports that a crystal engineering or reticular chem. strategy which controls pore functionality and pore size in a series of MOM with coordinately satd. metal centers and periodically arrayed hexafluorosilicate anions (SiF52-) enables a kinetics and thermodn. sweet spots offering high volumetric uptake at low CO2 partial pressure (<0.15 bar).  Most importantly, such MOM offer an unprecedented CO2 sorption selectivity over N2, H2, and CH4, even in the presence of moisture.  Thus, these MOM are relevant to CO2 sepn. in the context of post-combustion (flue gas, CO2/N2), pre-combustion (shifted synthesis gas stream, CO2/H2), and natural gas upgrading (natural gas clean-up, CO2/CH4).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXjsFCntbg%253D&md5=56941673abb6b13f920476a593dfeb98", "24.

To harness cation exchange as a rational tool, the authors need to elucidate its governing factors.  Not nearly enough exptl. observations exist for drawing these conclusions, so the authors provide a conceptual framework for approaching this task.  The authors address which SBUs undergo exchange, why certain ions replace others, how the framework influences the process, the role of the solvent, and current applications.  Using these guidelines, certain trends emerge from the available data and missing expts. become obvious.

(HKUST-1, PCN-11, and PCN-14) the CH4 storage capacities of which are among the highest reported so far among all porous materials.  The three MOFs consist of the same dicopper paddle-wheel secondary building units, but contain different org. linkers, leading to cagelike pores with various sizes and geometries.  From neutron powder diffraction expts. and accurate data anal., assisted by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and DFT calcns., we unambiguously revealed the exact locations of the stored methane mols. in these MOF materials.  We found that methane uptake takes place primarily at two types of strong adsorption site: (1) the open Cu coordination sites, which exhibit enhanced Coulomb attraction toward methane, and (2) the van der Waals potential pocket sites, in which the total dispersive interactions are enhanced due to the mol. being in contact with multiple \"surfaces.\".  Interestingly, the enhanced van der Waals sites are present exclusively in small cages and at the windows to these cages, whereas large cages with relatively flat pore surfaces bind very little methane.  Our results suggest that further, rational development of new MOF compds. for methane storage applications should focus on enriching open metal sites, increasing the vol. percentage of accessible small cages and channels, and minimizing the fraction of large pores.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXltlWgtb0%253D&md5=8f6059d2e137ca23fb5eeb17d127be74", "50.

Addnl., the relative importance of increasing volumetric capacity, rather than gravimetric capacity, for extending the driving range of natural gas vehicles is highlighted.  Other important systems-level factors, such as thermal management, mech. properties, and the effects of impurities, are also considered, and potential materials synthesis contributions to improving performance in a complete adsorbed natural gas system are discussed.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhvVGntLvE&md5=05a99cd7be9ef1819aca42d1c36f1f1d", "54.
