Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.  Because we can functionalize the pores to direct their specific recognition of small mols., the emerging porous MOFs serve as novel functional materials for gas storage, sepn., heterogeneous catalysis, and sensing.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlslyhtrs%253D&md5=f9230905a5656f9fe0e487967ecae356", "3.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from large point sources such as power plants is one option for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions; however, currently the capture alone will increase the energy requirements of a plant by 25-40%.  This review highlights the challenges for capture technologies which have the greatest likelihood of reducing CO2 emissions to the atm., namely postcombustion (predominantly CO2/N2 sepn.), precombustion (CO2/H2) capture, and natural gas sweetening (CO2/CH4).

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) -highly cryst. hybrid materials that combine metal ions with rigid org. ligands- have emerged as an important class of porous materials.  The org. ligands add flexibility and diversity to the chem. structures and functions of these materials.  In this Account, we summarize our lab.'s experience in tuning the topol. and functionality of MOFs by ligand design.  These investigations have led to new materials with interesting properties.  By using a ligand that can adopt different symmetry conformations through free internal bond rotation, we have obtained two MOFs that are supramol. stereoisomers of each other at different reaction temps.  In another case, where the dimerized ligands function as a D3-Piedfort unit spacer, we achieve chiral (10,3)-a networks.  In the design of MOF-based materials for hydrogen and methane storage, we focused on increasing the gas affinity of frameworks by using ligands with different geometries to control the pore size and effectively introduce unsatd. metal centers (UMCs) into the framework.  Framework interpenetration in PCN-6 (PCN stands for porous coordination network) can lead to higher hydrogen uptake.  Because of the proper alignment of the UMCs, PCN-12 holds the record for uptake of hydrogen at 77 K/760 Torr.  In the case of methane storage, PCN-14 with anthracene-derived ligand achieves breakthrough storage capacity, at a level 28% higher than the U.S. Department of Energy target.  Selective gas adsorption requires a pore size comparable to that of the target gas mols.; therefore, we use bulky ligands and network interpenetration to reduce the pore size.  In addn., with the help of an amphiphilic ligand, we were able to use temp. to continuously change pore size in a 2D layer MOF.  Adding charge to an org. ligand can also stabilize frameworks.  By ionizing the amine group within mesoMOF-1, the resulting electronic repulsion keeps the network from collapsing, giving rise to the first case of mesoporous MOF that demonstrates the type IV isotherm.  We use dendritic hexacarboxylate ligands to synthesize an isoreticular series of MOFs with (3,24)-connected network topol.  The cuboctahedral cages serve as building blocks that narrow the opening of the mesocavities into microwindows and stabilize these MOFs.  The resulting materials have exceptionally high surface areas and hydrogen uptake capacities.  Despite the many achievements in MOF development, there is still ample opportunity for further exploration.  We will be continuing our efforts and look forward to contributing to this blossoming field in the next decade.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhsV2ksbfO&md5=f17f81d99259e7ee659b30bcc2ddeea2", "9.

This is the highest value so far obsd. for H adsorption on a porous material.  The enthalpy of adsorption, decreases with increasing amt. adsorbed to 9.5 kJ mol-1 at .ltorsim.\u22481.9 mmol g-1 (2 H2 or D2 mols. per Cu corresponding to adsorption on both sides of planar Cu open centers) and is virtually unchanged in the range 1.9-3.6 mmol g-1.  Virial anal. of isotherms at 87.3 K is also consistent with 2 H2 or D2 mols. being bound to each open Cu center.  The adsorption kinetics follow a double exponential model, corresponding to diffusion along 2 types of pores, a slow component with high activation energy (13.35 \u00b1 0.59 kJ mol-1) for the narrow pores and a faster component with low activation energy (8.56 \u00b1 0.41 kJ mol-1).  The D2 adsorption kinetic consts. for both components were significantly faster than the corresponding H2 kinetics for specific pressure increments and had slightly lower activation energies than the corresponding values for H2 adsorption.  The kD2/kH2 ratio for the slow component was 1.62 \u00b1 0.07, while the fast component was 1.38 \u00b1 0.04 at 77.3 K, and the corresponding ratios were smaller at 87.3 K.  These observations of kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving in porous materials are due to the larger zero-point energy for the lighter H2, resulting in slower adsorption kinetics compared with the heavier D2.  A combination of open metal centers and confinement in ultramicroporosity leads to a high enthalpy for H2 adsorption over a wide range of surface coverage and quantum effects influence diffusion of H2 and D2 in pores in M'MOF 1.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXltVyjsLo%253D&md5=cd9993fbfa093dfecfd6324ec8f7d042", "25.

The affinity with CO2 is enhanced by addn. of a functional group, and the constricted pore is formed by interpenetration of the framework; both lead to a larger isosteric heat and Henry's const. and subsequently a stronger adsorption at low pressures.  The org. linker plays a crit. role in tuning the free vol. and accessible surface area and largely dets. CO2 adsorption at high pressures.  As a combination of high capacity and low framework d., IRMOF10, IRMOF14, and UMCM-1 are identified from this study to be the best for CO2 storage, even surpass the exptl. reported highest capacity in MOF-177.
