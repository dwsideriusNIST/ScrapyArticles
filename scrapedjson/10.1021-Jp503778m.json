As can be seen from Figure ", "3", ", the behavior of both dispersion and repulsion contributions is essentially similar in all cases. Being virtually independent of the adsorption site, these two contributions are only slightly dependent on the molecular orientation, which is not surprising given that the charge density distribution around the molecule is not spherical.

Specifically, the sign of the electrostatic interactions varies with respect to the direction of the dipole associated with the water molecule, while the corresponding magnitude is appreciably higher near the Mg", "2+", " ion. Close to the linker, the electrostatic term is significantly smaller and does not make any noticeable contribution to the total interaction energy. Therefore, the binding of water to the Mg site results from an interplay between the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions, whereas at the linker site it is almost exclusively determined by the van der Waals interactions. Therefore, we expect that the water molecules initially occupy all open metal sites before the linkers are covered.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Framework Structure and Computational Details", "Force Field Model", "Validation of the Force Field and Radial Distribution Functions", "Adsorption Properties and Isotherms", "Summary and Conclusions", "References", "Validation of the Force Field and Radial Distribution Functions", "Up to now, we have shown that the derived force field quite accurately reproduces a number of potential energy curves obtained from the DFT calculations (Figure ", "3", ").

To this end, we perform a series of both classical and ab initio MD simulations for different temperatures by considering an intermediate loading of 24 water molecules per simulation cell distributed in such a way that only one pore channel is filled with molecules, whereas adjacent channels remain empty.

A \u201cjump\u201d in loading is also noticeable at 750 Pa. At higher pressures, all TIP", "n", "P+UFF models qualitatively reproduce the experimental results quite well.

It reproduces the shape of the isotherm as a function of pressure over the complete investigated pressure range. The more accurate results compared to those of the TIP", "n", "P+UFF models is related to the improved description of the framework\u2013adsorbate interactions, especially the OMS\u2013adsorbate interaction as described earlier. Nevertheless, the first points at 0.1 and 1 Pa show an overestimation of the loadings (6.0 mol/kg for the simulation compared to \u22480.5 mol/kg for the highest experimental data at 1 Pa). The Henry coefficient calculated for zero loading is very high (161.3 mol/(kg\u00b7Pa)) as well, thus showing the overprediction in the lowest-pressure regime. The deviation can be attributed to the perfect crystal structure, which is assumed in the simulations and cannot be reproduced by experiments because of defects. Furthermore, precise measurements at very low pressures are difficult. In the intermediate pressure regime (>100 Pa and <2000 Pa), the DFT-derived force field reproduces the slight increase of loading with pressure as observed in the experimental data sets. As for higher pressures (>2000 Pa), the simulated isotherm lies well within the ranges of the experimental data, but below the TIP", "n", "P+UFF results. We note that as the TIP3P model is used to describe the adsorbate\u2013adsorbate interaction, such results are expected.

Note that the point charges on the hydrogen were adjusted accordingly (see Table ", "3", "). The charge difference made the framework energy less negative and thus less hydrophilic compared to that of the TIP3P+UFF model. As a result, less loading is predicted. Therefore, the choice of the point charges is of great importance for the shape of the adsorption isotherm. To be more realistic, the point charges should be changed with loading and position of the water molecules, which has not been considered within the present work.", "We also computed adsorption isotherms at 280 and 320 K at the same conditions.

For all temperatures, the saturation loading for the Mg sites (\u2248 8.25 mol/kg) is reached at very low pressures. At higher loadings, the isotherm behavior is more strongly temperature-dependent.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) have recently attracted intense research interest because of their permanent porous structures, large surface areas, and potential applications as novel adsorbents.  The recent progress in adsorption-based CO2 capture by MOFs is reviewed and summarized in this crit. review.  CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approx. atm. pressures.  Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore vols. of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, resp.  Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4.  Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites.  In addn., strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chem. bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement.  Besides the advantages, two main challenges of using MOFs in CO2 capture, the cost of synthesis and the stability toward water vapor, have been analyzed and possible solns. and path forward have been proposed to address the two challenges as well (150 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XivFWlsbo%253D&md5=0ff1149f94a6e21a49a6591786eac483", "8.

This development is based on two important columns: (i) The improved description of electronic many-body effects within d.-functional theory (DFT) and the upcoming post-DFT methods.  (ii) The implementation of the new functionals and many-body techniques within highly efficient, stable, and versatile computer codes, which allow to exploit the potential of modern computer architectures.  In this review, I discuss the implementation of various DFT functionals [local-d. approxn. (LDA), generalized gradient approxn. (GGA), meta-GGA, hybrid functional mixing DFT, and exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange] and post-DFT approaches [DFT + U for strong electronic correlations in narrow bands, many-body perturbation theory (GW) for quasiparticle spectra, dynamical correlation effects via the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (AC-FDT)] in the Vienna ab initio simulation package VASP.

Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature.  However, despite many applications, std. general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional \"hard\" matter such as metals, ionic compds., and insulators are lacking.  Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and mols. on the surfaces of solids.  Here we calc. the lattice consts., bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring.  We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice consts. in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers.  However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to av. errors which are similar to those of PBE or better.  Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs.

Conventional ESP fitting procedures developed for mol. systems, in general, will not work for cryst. systems because the electrostatic potential in periodic systems is ill-defined up to a const. offset at each spatial position.  In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its abs. values, as it is currently done with mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  We formally demonstrate that the new functional reduces to the conventional error functional used in mol. ESP approaches when the simulation box of the periodic calcn. becomes infinitely large.  Several tests are presented to validate the new technique.  For the periodic calcn. of isolated mols., the REPEAT charges are found to be in good agreement with those detd. with established mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional mol. ESP approaches generate 'unphys.' charges, whereas the REPEAT method produces charges that are both chem. intuitive and consistent between different periodic electronic structure packages.  The new approach is employed to generate partial at. charges of various microporous materials and compared to both exptl. derived and mol. fragment ESP charges.  This method can be used to generate partial at. charges to be used in simulations of microporous and nanoporous materials, such as zeolites and metal org. framework materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXhtVGgurrN&md5=35619c9df3eaa69f185d135f79dddbf9", "44.

For 12 different functionals, a std. \"zero-damping\" formula and rational damping to finite values for small interat. distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested.  The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coeffs. is used.  The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interat. forces at shorter distances.  With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramol. dispersion in four representative mol. structures are found.  For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermol. distances.  For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general.  The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of cor. GGAs for non-covalent interactions.  According to the thermodn. benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate esp. for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are obsd.  It seems to provide a phys. correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified std. functionals.  In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying d. functional.  \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.; J.

The force fields derived by using this methodol. accurately predict the CO2 and H2O adsorption isotherms inside Mg-MOF-74, and is transferable to Zn-MOF-74; by replacing the Mg-CO2 interactions with the corresponding Zn-CO2 interactions, we obtain an accurate prediction of the corresponding isotherm.  This methodol. was used to address the effect of water on the sepn. of flue gases in these materials.  In general, the mixt. isotherms of CO2 and H2O calcd. with these derived force fields show a significant redn. in CO2 uptake with the existence of trace amts. of water vapor.
