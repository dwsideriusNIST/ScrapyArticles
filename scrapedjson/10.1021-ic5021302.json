This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.

X-ray crystallog. characterization reveals that adjacent layers are stacked such that channels are created, except in 5.  The channels form a H-bonded interior for guest mols.; in practice, 1a contains EtOH and H2O mols. as guests in the channels with H bonds, whereas 3b (3a) contains THF (acetone) mols.  In 1a, the double-edged axe-shaped motifs in adjacent sheets are not located over the top of each other, while the motifs in 3b stack so perfectly as to overlap each other in an edge-to-edge fashion.  This subtle change in the three-dimensional framework is assocd. with the template effect of the guests.  Compd. 5 has no guest mols. and, therefore, the amide groups in one sheet were used for H-bonding links with adjacent sheets.  Removal of the guest mols. from 1a and 3b (3a) causes a structural conversion accompanied by a color change.  Pink 1a cannot retain its original framework and changes into a blue amorphous compd.  However, the framework of pink 3b (3a) is transformed to a new cryst. framework of violet 4.  The complex 4 reverts to the original pink crystals of 3b (3a) when it is exposed to THF (or acetone) vapor.  Spectroscopic measurements (visible, EPR, and IR) provide a clue to the crystal-to-crystal transformation; on removal of the guests, the amide groups were used to form the \u03b2 sheet-type H bonding between the sheets, and thus the framework withstands significant stress on removal of guest mols.  This mechanism is attributed to the arrangement of the adjacent sheets so suited in regularity that the \u03b2 sheet-type structure forms efficiently.  The apohost 4 does not adsorb cyclopentane, showing a guest selectivity that, in addn. to size, H-bonding capability is required for the guest mols.

Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.  Because we can functionalize the pores to direct their specific recognition of small mols., the emerging porous MOFs serve as novel functional materials for gas storage, sepn., heterogeneous catalysis, and sensing.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlslyhtrs%253D&md5=f9230905a5656f9fe0e487967ecae356", "18.

The presence of unsatd. Cr(III) sites in MIL-101 provides an intrinsic chelating property with electron-rich functional groups.  This feature offers a powerful way to selectively functionalize the unsatd. sites in the MOFs, differing in many respects from the functionalization of mesoporous silica and other porous hybrids reported so far.  This work demonstrates that the surface amine-grafting undoubtedly provides a general way of selective functionalization of porous MOFs besides that with unsatd. metal sites.  The present approach indeed ensures the development of functionalized MOFs for the immobilization and encapsulation of org. mols. and metal components that are useful for catalysis, adsorption, mol. recognition, and so on.

Mastering the prodn. of solar fuels by artificial photosynthesis would be a considerable feat, either by water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen or redn. of CO2 to methanol or hydrocarbons: 2H2O + 4h\u03bd \u2192 O2 + 2H2; 2H2O + CO2 + 8h\u03bd \u2192 2O2 + CH4.  It is notable that water oxidn. to dioxygen is a key half-reaction in both.  In principle, these solar fuel reactions can be coupled to light absorption in mol. assemblies, nanostructured arrays, or photoelectrochem. cells (PECs) by a modular approach.  The modular approach uses light absorption, electron transfer in excited states, directed long range electron transfer and proton transfer, both driven by free energy gradients, combined with proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) and single electron activation of multielectron catalysis.  Anal. of water oxidn. mechanism for the blue Ru dimer cis,cis-[(bpy)2(H2O)RuIIIORuIII(OH2)(bpy)2]4+ (bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine) has opened a new, general approach to single site catalysts both in soln. and on electrode surfaces.  As a catalyst, the blue dimer is limited by competitive side reactions involving anation, but its rate of water oxidn. can be greatly enhanced by electron transfer mediators such as Ru(bpy)2(bpz)2+ (bpz is 2,2'-bipyrazine) in soln. or Ru(4,4'-((HO)2P(O)CH2)2bpy)2(bpy)2+ on ITO (ITO/Sn) or FTO (SnO2/F) electrodes.  In this review, the authors describe a general reactivity toward water oxidn. in a class of mols. whose properties can be tuned systematically by synthetic variations based on mechanistic insight.  These mols. catalyze water oxidn. driven either electrochem. or by Ce(IV).  The 1st two were in the series Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ and Ru(tpy)(bpz)(OH2)2+ (bpm is 2,2'- bipyrimidine; tpy is 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine), which undergo hundreds of turnovers without decompn. with Ce(IV) as oxidant.  Detailed mechanistic studies and DFT calcns. revealed a stepwise mechanism: initial 2e-/2H+ oxidn., to RuIV = O2+, 1e- oxidn. to RuV = O3+, nucleophilic H2O attack to give RuIII-OOH2+, further oxidn. to RuIV(O2)2+, and, finally, oxygen loss, which is in competition with further oxidn. of RuIV(O2)2+ to RuV(O2)3+, which loses O2 rapidly.  An extended family of 10-15 catalysts based on Mebimpy (Mebimpy is 2,6-bis(1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine), tpy, and heterocyclic carbene ligands all appear to share a common mechanism.  The osmium complex Os(tpy)(bpy)(OH2)2+ also functions as a water oxidn. catalyst.  Mechanistic expts. revealed addnl. pathways for water oxidn. one involving Cl- catalysis and another, rate enhancement of O-O bond formation by concerted atom-proton transfer (APT).  Surface-bound [(4,4'-((HO)2P(O)CH2)2bpy)2RuII(bpm)RuII(Mebimpy)(OH2)]4+ and its tpy analog are impressive electrocatalysts for water oxidn., undergoing thousands of turnovers without loss of catalytic activity.  These catalysts were designed for use in dye-sensitized solar cell configurations on TiO2 to provide oxidative equiv. by mol. excitation and excited-state electron injection.  Transient absorption measurements on TiO2[(4,4'((HO)2P(O)CH2)2bpy)2RuII(bpm)RuII(Mebimpy)(OH2)]4+, (TiO2-RuII-RuIIOH2) and its tpy analog provided direct insight into the interfacial and intramol. electron transfer events that occur following excitation.  With added hydroquinone in a PEC configuration, APCE (absorbed-photon-to-current-efficiency) values of 4-5% are obtained for dehydrogenation of hydroquinone, H2Q + 2h\u03bd \u2192 Q + H2.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), a new class of cryst. mol. solids built from linking org. ligands with metal or metal-cluster connecting points, have recently emerged as a versatile platform for developing single-site solid catalysts.

MOF catalysts are easily sepd. from the reaction mixts. for reuse, and yet their mol. nature introduces unprecedented chem. diversity and tunability to drive a large scope of catalytic reactions.  This Perspective aims to summarize recent progress on light harvesting and photocatalysis with MOFs.  The charge-sepd. excited states of the chromophoric building blocks created upon photon excitation can migrate over long distances to be harvested as redox equiv. at the MOF/liq. interfaces via electron transfer reactions or can directly activate the substrates that have diffused into the MOF channels for photocatalytic reactions.

The MEPEs are distinct from the frequently reported analogs derived from unsubstituted tpy.  The photophys. properties such as emission spectroscopic properties and lifetime at both room temp. and 77 K are presented.  The MEPEs are luminescent at room temp. with quantum yields (\u03a6lum) < 10-6 and lifetimes on a timescale of nanoseconds (\u03c4 = ca. 6.6-22.4 ns), and display strong luminescence at 77 K with \u03a6lum = ca. 0.21-2.5 \u00d7 10-2 and lifetimes on a timescale of microseconds (\u03c4 = ca. 2.4-7.9 \u03bcs).

This result is in contrast to the reported data in the literature where an increased intensity was obsd. when substitution occurred at the 4'-position of tpys, regardless of the electron-rich or electron-deficient nature of the substituents.

This mix-and-match approach mimics the widely applied metal ion doping (or solid soln. formation) in traditional inorg. materials, such as metal oxides, wherein maintaining charge balance of the doped lattice and ensuring size match between doped metal ions and the parent lattice are key to successful doping.  In this work, we prepd. three sterically demanding dicarboxylate ligands based on Ir/Ru-phosphors with similar structures and variable charges (-2 to 0), [Ir-(ppy)3]-dicarboxylate (L1, ppy is 2-phenylpyridine), [Ir-(bpy)-(ppy)2]+-dicarboxylate (L2, bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine), and Ru-(bpy)3]2+-dicarboxylate (L3), and successfully doped them into the known IRMOF-9/-10 structures by taking advantage of matching length between 4,4'-biphenyl dicarboxylate (BPDC) and L1-L3.  We systematically investigated the effects of size and charge of the doping ligand on the MOF structures and the ligand doping levels in these MOFs.  L1 carries a -2 charge to satisfy the charge requirement of the parent Zn4O-(BPDC)3 framework and can be mixed into the IRMOF-9/-10 structure in the whole range of H2L1/H2BPDC ratios from 0 to 1.  The steric bulk of L1 induces a phase transition from the interpenetrated IRMOF-9 structure to the non-interpenetrated IRMOF-10 counterpart.  L2 and L3 do not match the dineg. charge of BPDC in order to maintain the charge balance for a neutral IRMOF-9/-10 framework and can only be doped into the IRMOF-9 structure to a certain degree.  L2 and L3 form a charge-balanced new phase with a neutral framework structure at higher doping levels (>8% For L2 and >6% For L3).

Bonds with delocalized electrons and therefore metallic character, such as Sm-S, V-S, and Re-O, are significantly shorter than similar bonds with localized electrons.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaE2sXjs1Gluw%253D%253D&md5=28244250b72befe0ccb7aa7779ed4c38"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2015/inocaj.2015.54.issue-6/ic5021302/20150310/images/small/ic-2014-021302_0009.gif\">"]}
