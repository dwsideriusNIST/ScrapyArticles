It is particularly the mild conditions that these catalysts are able to operate at and the selectivity that they demonstrate that make these materials dream targets for scientists involved in the art of synthesizing homogeneous and heterogeneous industrial catalysts.  But enzymes also have their weak points; in particular their low thermal stability and their often too slow reaction rates for an economical industrial process are problems that have to be overcome.  The obvious soln. would be to copy the catalytic active center into a robust open framework.  A key property of an enzyme is its selectivity; this property is partly regulated by steric constraints surrounding the catalytically active site.  The microporous zeolite based catalysts in some cases show impressive selectivity based on the geometrical constraints imposed by the size and shape of the regular channels in these cryst. silicate and alumino-phosphate based structures, and enzyme-like properties have been claimed but the pure inorg. nature of the selective internal surface in these materials makes it impossible to mimic many important enzymic properties.  The new generation of microporous materials, Metal Org. Frameworks (MOFs) are hybrids of org. and inorg. structures.  This dualistic nature offers an unprecedented flexibility in the possibility to incorporate both org. and metallic functional groups into the ordered cryst. lattice and thereby opening up for a much greater possibility to copy structural motifs known from enzymes into much simpler but also more stable open structures.  Several groups are working on development of new catalysts by this approach.  Here we will illustrate this approach with structures that mimic anhydrase and C-H activation.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXnvVehsrk%253D&md5=93814c28361a9521c579533a52aca3fe", "6.

While conductive heating occasionally has been applied to peptide synthesis, precise microwave irradn. to heat the reaction mixt. during coupling and N\u03b1-deprotection has become increasingly popular.  It has often provided dramatic redns. in synthesis times, accompanied by an increase in the crude peptide purity.  Microwave heating has been proven esp. relevant for sequences which might form \u03b2-sheet type structures and for sterically difficult couplings.  The beneficial effect of microwave heating appears so far to be due to the precise nature of this type of heating, rather than a peptide-specific microwave effect.  However, microwave heating as such is not a panacea for all difficulties in peptide syntheses and the conditions may need to be adjusted for the incorporation of Cys, His and Asp in peptides, and for the synthesis of, for example, phosphopeptides, glycopeptides, and N-methylated peptides.  Here, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the advances in microwave heating for peptide synthesis, with a focus on systematic studies and general protocols, as well as important applications.

Most of the time, they could not be synthesized directly with their properties and so their surfaces need to be tailored for their final applications.  In the last few years various surfaces (polymer resins, porous materials, metal org. frameworks, inorg. nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes...) were evaluated with reported reaction rate accelerations and higher yields.

The pure phase NH2-MIL-101(Al) can only be formed in very specific synthesis conditions, where both the metal source and the solvent used play a key role.  The resulting porous solid shows a high thermal and chem. stability, decompg. at temps. above 650 K in air.  The NH2-MIL-101(Al) framework offers an excellent trade off for sepn. of CO2: the combination of high stability, acceptable capacity at low adsorbate partial pressures, high selectivity, and fast regenerability makes this new material a very attractive candidate for applications like natural gas or biogas upgrading.  CO2 capacities up to 62 wt.% are obtained at room temp. and 3 MPa.  In addn. to an excellent sepn. performance, the NH2-MIL-101(Al) shows a high activity in the basic catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with Et cyanoacetate at 313 K even in an as apolar a solvent as toluene (turn over frequency, TOF = 1.8 h-1).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXltlartbg%253D&md5=67ccec5e7372f5ac4f758fe115ab48bd", "19.
