With respect to the H", "2", "/CH", "4", " separation factor of \u03b1 \u2243 15, the oriented membrane shows a slightly higher selectivity in comparison to our non-oriented ZIF-8 (\u03b1 \u2243 11) membrane and the membrane prepared by McCarthy et al. (pure gas or ideal separation factor: \u224313). We explain this result by an improved microstructure quality of the oriented ZIF-8 membrane, i.e., a better intergrowth of the grains and consequently lower leak transport, rather than by the crystal orientation. However, in industrial applications, the permeance (which is the pressure-normalized flux in mol m", "\u22122", " s", "\u22121", " Pa", "\u22121", ") of a membrane is at least as important as its separation factor. In comparison to our non-oriented ZIF-8 membrane, the decrease in layer thickness from 30 to 12 \u03bcm resulted in an almost doubled H", "2", " permeance. However, following Fick\u2019s first law from which the permeance through the membrane is reciprocally correlated with the membrane thickness, we would expect an increase in the permeance by the factor 2.5. The difference between the actual and expected increase in permeance can be explained by the improved quality of the novel, oriented ZIF-8 membrane, as indicated by the higher H", "2", "/CH", "4", " separation factor (Figure ", "9", "b). The permeances of the 30 \u03bcm thick membrane likely include a higher contribution of undefined mass transport through defects or leaks, which results in a lower selectivity.", "The ZIF-8 membrane reported by McCarthy et al. exhibits a layer thickness of around 20 \u03bcm, while the permeances were found to be even higher than those reported here. Though McCarthy et al. performed pure gas measurements only (and we have previously shown that there is a slight but noticeable reduction of the permeances in H", "2", "/CH", "4", " mixed gas separation compared to the pure gases),", "(31)", " the deviation might be explained primarily by the different experimental measurement methods. For the permeation measurements, McCarthy et al. used an instationary time lag method,", "(54)", " where a constant gas pressure is applied to the feed side of the membrane, while the time-dependent pressure increase at the evacuated permeate side of the membrane is monitored. Permeances can be calculated from the recorded pressure-time curves, and it is ideally assumed that the permeate side pressure is near zero. In our experiments, we used a modified, stationary Wicke\u2212Kallenbach technique (see ", "Experimental Section", "), where the permeate partial pressure is kept near zero by sweeping with an inert gas. Hence, in idealized theory, the boundary conditions of permeation are the same for both experiments. However, because the porous alumina support might act as dead volume, the idealized assumption of a zero partial pressure at the permeate side might be problematic. To minimize this concentration polarization, the alumina supports have an asymmetric structure and consist of only a thin layer with a small pore size (\u223c70 nm) supporting the ZIF-8 layer and a thick coarse layer as mechanical support with a large pore size (\u223c 10 \u03bcm). This asymmetric structure reduces the pressure loss across the membrane. Even a small increase in the residual partial pressure at the permeate side can, however, highly influence the concentration gradient (see Figure S4 of the ", "Supporting Information", ") and reduce our measured permeances. Further influences of different experimental configurations in the Wicke\u2212Kallenbach technique are very well investigated on zeolite membranes by van de Graaf et al.", "(55)", "Recently Aguado et al. showed permeation measurements for tubular composite membranes of SIM-1 (Zn(4m5cim)", "2", ", 4m5cim = 4-methyl-5-imidazolecarboxaldehyde) with a layer thickness of 25 \u03bcm.", "(56)", " SIM-1 is iso-structural to ZIF-8, and the membrane shows permeances of light gases in a similar order of magnitude as for the here shown ZIF-8 membranes.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results and Discussion", "Conclusions", "References", "Conclusions", "We prepared for the first time a continuous ZIF-8 layer on top of a porous alumina support by secondary seeded growth.

Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.

In the current work, the authors chose ZIF-7 as a promising candidate for the development of a H2-selective membrane.  ZIF-7 is formed by bridging benzimidazolate anions and zinc cations with soladite (SOD) topol.  The pore size of ZIF-7 (the hexagonal window size in the SOD cage) estd. from crystallog. data is \u223c0.3 nm, which is just in between the size of H2 (0.29 nm) and CO2 (0.33 nm).  A ZIF-7 membrane could therefore be expected to display a high selectivity of H2 over CO2 and other gases through a mol. sieving effect.  The ultramicroporous zeolitic imidazolate framework, ZIF-7, was tested for its gas-sepn. properties in membrane applications by synthesizing it on a porous alumina support using a microwave-assisted secondary growth technique.  In terms of H2 sepn., the ZIF-7 membrane has several advantages: (1) its pore dimension approaches the size of H2, therefore a high H2 selectivity could be obtained without any sophisticated pore-size engineering; (2) it is thermally stable for use up to at least 500\u00b0C in air; and (3)its hydrophobicity endows it with very good hydrothermal stability.  The present work also demonstrates a general approach towards the fabrication of high-quality MOF membranes on ceramic supports: polymers with coordination abilities such as PEI in current work, which can be used to aid the seeding procedure, and fast microwave synthesis, which is superior for reducing the membrane thickness.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXktlansg%253D%253D&md5=be6db119b89094408a334658f1b24139", "35.

The permeation of H2 through the ZIF-7 membrane is highly activated with an apparent activation energy of 11.9 kJ mol-1.

C. A. 35, 3872.8.  The existence of surface diffusion on inhomogeneous (inner) surfaces, e. g., of activated charcoal, is demonstrated experimentally.  The total transport is divided as follows: (1) normal diffusion of the adsorbed gas through the carrier gas, occurring in pores whose cross section is large relative to the free path of adsorbed gas mols.; (2) Knudsen mol. flow in pores whose cross sections are small relative to the mean free path; (3) surface diffusion of the adsorbed mols. on the pore walls.  In the present state of knowledge the pressure and temp. dependence of the 3 kinds of diffusion are lumped together.  No attention is given to diffusion through mol. slits of dimensions small relative to the range of the adsorption forces of the walls.  For measurement of the total diffusion through sintered glass, granulated clay and granules of medicinal, activated charcoal, these substances were cemented into glass tubes.  A mixt. of N2 and CO2, at a const. CO2 partial pressure of 100 mm., was kept flowing by one side of the diffusion plug.  A second stream (N2) swept the CO2 away from the other side of the plug, the CO2 content of the resulting mixt. being detd. in a sensitive heat-conducting app. empirically calibrated.  The N2 partial pressure varied from 0 to 660 mm., the temp. from 0\u00b0 to 300\u00b0.  The method and app. are described in detail.  Interpretation of the pressure and temp. curves shows that in the sintered glass the transport takes place mainly by normal diffusion except at low pressures, whereas Knudsen flow prevails in the granulated clay below 1 atm. (total pressure).  The medicinal charcoal is intermediate in behavior: at 1 atm. normal diffusion predominates; with decreasing pressure the proportion of Knudsen flow increases.  Similar measurements on two tech. activated charcoals gave isotherms and isobars which show that in this case surface diffusion accounts for an appreciable part of the total transport.  The surface diffusion is partly continuous, i. e., runs from one side of the plug to the other parallel to, but independently of, the space diffusion, and partly discontinuous, i. e., in narrow channels, part of the transport occurring by space diffusion elsewhere becomes surface diffusion.  By graphical and computational methods the continuous surface diffusion can be sepd. from the other varieties.  At 0\u00b0 and 760 mm. total pressure about half of the total transport is due to surface diffusion.  From the temp. dependence of the total diffusion (isobaric) through the activated charcoals it is shown that the energy effective for surface diffusion is only 1-2 kg.-cal. smaller than the heat of adsorption (6.5-7.5 kg.-cal.).  Transport by surface diffusion decreases rather gradually with rising temp. and is still appreciable at 200\u00b0 where adsorption is no longer noticeable.  A quant. evaluation of the measurements is not possible because the results are inaccurate owing to disturbing effects of the cements (Bakelite paste P of the Bakelitgesellschaft, Berlin Erkner and magnesia cement for higher temps.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaH3sXks1Cl&md5=44f0d3e35acc148e0d838f5508357841", "40.

By the combination of outward growth and lateral growth, those crystals that have their fastest growth direction at an angle to the normal to the membrane will dominate in the early stages of growth, and an oblique orientation develops.  With prolonged growth the crystals with the fastest growth direction perpendicular to the membrane will dominate and the classic competitive growth model applies again.

This gas-phase separation is attributed to a gate-opening effect in which specific threshold pressures control the uptake and release of individual molecules.  These threshold pressures differ for the different molecules, leaving a window of selective uptake operation.  This phenomenon makes ZIF-7 a perfect candidate for the separation of olefins from paraffins, since in contrast to most microporous materials, the paraffin is selectively adsorbed.

Because of the simple nature of the permeation expt., transport parameters can be directly obtained from exptl. data hence avoiding the intensive math. treatment required by other techniques.  The method has historically been applied to diffusion and adsorption in porous membranes and diffusion in polymer membranes.  Since its origins in 1920, interest in the time lag method has expanded because of its value in characterizing simple permeation processes and also complex systems of diffusion with simultaneous adsorption and surface diffusion.  This review focuses on presenting the asymptotic soln. of the mass balance diffusion equations and includes applications of time lag anal., in order to give a crit. and broad perspective of this method as a tool for characterization.  It includes much of the previously published literature in order to show that for most cases the asymptotic soln. of the transport equations is simple, and for more complex cases that an anal. soln. is possible hence avoiding cumbersome numerical techniques.

The expts. were performed in a continuous and discontinuous way, with and without the use of a sweep gas.  From the comparison of the different techniques it was found that the sweep gas significantly influences the permeation of the feed component.  This effect was found to be dependent on the nature of the sweep gas and on the magnitude of the counterpermeation.  The exptl. configuration, such as the orientation of the composite membrane with respect to the feed side, affects the local conditions at both sides of the zeolite layer, resulting in quite different permeances.
