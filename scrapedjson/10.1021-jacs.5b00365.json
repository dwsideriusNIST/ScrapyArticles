The objective of this Highlight article is to provide the reader with a sense of where the field stands after roughly fifteen years of research.

We discuss the basic elements of MOF assembly and present a conceptual hierarchy of structural elements that assists in understanding how unique properties in these materials can be achieved.  Structure-function relationships are then discussed; several are now well understood, as a result of the focused efforts of many research groups over the past decade.

So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.

The authors present a systematic approach to understanding low pressure CO2 affinity in isostructural metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) using mol. simulations and apply it to obtain quant., mol.-level insight into interesting exptl. low pressure adsorption trends in a series of pillared MOFs.  The exptl. results show that increasing the no. of nonpolar functional groups on the benzene dicarboxylate (BDC) linker in the pillared DMOF-1 [Zn2(BDC)2(DABCO)] structure is an effective way to tune the CO2 Henry's coeff. in this isostructural series.  These findings are contrary to the common scenario where polar functional groups induce the greatest increase in low pressure affinity through polarization of the CO2 mol.  Instead, MOFs in this isostructural series contg. nitro, hydroxyl, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine functional groups result in little increase to the low pressure CO2 affinity.  Strong agreement between simulated and exptl. Henry's coeff. values is obtained from simulations on representative structures, and a powerful yet simple approach involving the anal. of the simulated heats of adsorption, adsorbate d. distributions, and min. energy 0 K binding sites is presented to elucidate the intermol. interactions governing these interesting trends.  Through a combined exptl. and simulation approach, the authors demonstrate how subtle, structure-specific differences in CO2 affinity induced by functionalization can be understood at the mol.-level through classical simulations.  This work also illustrates how structure-property relationships resulting from chem. functionalization can be very specific to the topol. and electrostatic environment in the structure of interest.  Given the excellent agreement between expts. and simulation, predicted CO2 selectivities over N2, CH4, and CO are also investigated to demonstrate that Me groups also provide the greatest increase in CO2 selectivity relative to the other functional groups.
