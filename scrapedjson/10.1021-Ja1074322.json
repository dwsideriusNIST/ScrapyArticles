First and foremost, to observe separation of the dye mixture into distinct bands, both the transport terms (", "D", " and ", "u", ") and the reaction terms (", "R", ") must be non-negligible (Figure ", "4", "a). In the absence of ", "R", "\u2019s (i.e., ", "R", "PB", " = ", "R", "TH", " = 0), the separation based on the differences in diffusivities alone is not expected to produce sharp, separate bands (Figure ", "4", "b). At the same time, transport properties do matter. This situation is illustrated in Figure ", "4", "c where the reaction terms are different (", "R", "PB", " \u2260 ", "R", "TH", " \u2260 0), but there is no capillary flow term (", "u", " = 0), only diffusive transport; in this case, the bands migrate very slowly and the separation is, again, poor. We make three further comments regarding the ability to control the above parameters experimentally: (1) The diffusivities should depend on the size of the migrating molecules. In the limit where the molecules are larger than the pores of the crystal, ", "D", " = 0, as is in fact the case for the CR and CB dyes that do not enter MOF-5. (2) The capillary term ", "u", " is largely determined by the solvent and not by the identity of the solutes. Hence, while it is true that capillarity helps the mixture to migrate through the crystal, the value of ", "u", " cannot be made different independently for each component of the mixture. (3) In contrast, it should be possible, as in traditional affinity chromatography, to adjust the ", "R", " terms selectively by tailoring the molecular-scale interactions between the migrating molecules and the MOF scaffold. For the PB/TH system, it could be argued that TH migrates slower because the primary amino groups in TH can form hydrogen bonds with the MOF scaffold. This type of chemical reasoning could also rationalize the order of migration in the systems shown in Figure ", "2", ". For example, MY, a neutral dye, incapable of hydrogen bonding or strong charge\u2212charge interactions with the MOF-5 scaffold, always moves faster than other dyes (Figure ", "2", "b, c and d). For BG/PB and BG/PB/MY systems illustrated in Figure ", "2", "a and ", "2", "d, BG always migrates slower than other dyes, likely because of its relatively large size that results in greater van der Waals interactions with MOF-5. In the case of the AA/PY pair (Figure ", "2", "e), both dyes can interact with the MOF-5 scaffold by means of electrostatic interactions, but only AA can engage in hydrogen bonding via its primary amino group; hence AA migrates slower than PY.", " ", "Figure 4.

Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.

In this work, inverse gas chromatog. (IGC) utilizing micropacked capillary columns was used to probe the adsorption of more than 30 volatile org. compds. (VOCs) on IRMOF-1.  In an attempt to study the effect of structural degrdn. upon VOC adsorption, multiple samples of IRMOF-1 with widely ranging properties were investigated.  Trends in the differential enthalpies and equil. consts. for the adsorption of VOCs were detd. on the basis of the mol. properties of the adsorbate and the structural properties of the MOF sample.  The results indicate that samples of IRMOF-1 that are affected by a moderate amt. of structural degrdn. interact with adsorbed species more strongly than does a sample with fewer defects, resulting in higher heats of adsorption.  Samples of IRMOF-1 with sp. surface areas of around 1000 m2/g show heats of adsorption for alkanes that are higher than those estd. previously via Monte Carlo calcns.  Although the data for nonpolar (and weakly polar) species showed many of the anticipated trends for the interactions with IRMOF-1, the equil. behavior of polar VOCs did not correlate well with the mol. properties of the adsorbate (i.e., vapor pressure and deformation polarizability), leaving some uncertainty about the nature of the interaction mechanism.  The equil. data and the heats of adsorption were found to fit well to a small group of mol. descriptors through the application of the Abraham linear free-energy relationship, thus providing insight into the complex interactions between the MOF structure and the VOC compds.  Hydrogen bonding interactions were detd. to be the primary contributors to specific interactions between adsorbates and the MOF surface.  Size exclusion also seems to play a role in the adsorption of larger species.  These results show that the interaction of VOCs with MOFs is more complex than previously assumed and that more work is needed to probe the mechanisms of these processes.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXmtVymsL4%253D&md5=77c1c3a8c6c92fadbb1d0c894fc835ca", " ", "14.
