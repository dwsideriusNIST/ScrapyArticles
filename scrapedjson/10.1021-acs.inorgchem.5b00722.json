MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

Subsequent sections discuss specific examples of MOF sensors, categorized by method of signal transduction.  Sensors based on MOF photoluminescence are discussed briefly.  The authors have limited the review of luminescence-based sensors to a small no. of recent reports where the porous MOF architecture, or its chem. compn., imparts selective sensing capabilities.  Scintillating MOFs that luminesce in the presence of radioactive analytes are also discussed.  Other signal transduction schemes that use photons include various kinds of optical interferometry, analyte modulation of localized surface plasmon resonance energies, and solvatochromism.  Mech. signal-transduction schemes employed with MOFs include ones based on surface acoustic wave, quartz crystal microbalance, and microcantilever devices.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are a class of hybrid materials self-assembled from org. bridging ligands and metal ion/cluster connecting points.  The combination of a variety of org. linkers, metal ions/clusters, and structural motifs can lead to an infinite array of new materials with interesting properties for many applications.  In this Forum Article, the design and applications of MOFs in chem. sensing and biol. imaging are discussed.  The first half of this article focuses on the development of MOFs as chem. sensors by highlighting how unique attributes of MOFs can be used to enhance sensitivity and selectivity.  The authors also discuss some of the issues that need to be addressed to develop practically useful MOF sensors.  The second half of this article focuses on the design and applications of nanoscale MOFs (NMOFs) as imaging contrast agents.  NMOFs possess several interesting attributes, such as high cargo loading capacity, ease of postmodification, tunable size and shape, and intrinsic biodegradability, to make them excellent candidates as imaging contrast agents.  The use of representative NMOFs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), x-ray computed tomog. (CT), and optical imaging are discussed.

Smart and careful design strategies need to be adopted for the synthesis of lanthanide-org. framework materials to strike a balance between the high coordination requirement of lanthanide metal ions and the formation of stable and permanently porous structures.  Literature reports have documented successful synthesis of such porous lanthanide frameworks with potential application for gas storage.  Lanthanide-org. frameworks have also shown promise in a no. of magento-luminescent applications.  The diverse emission profiles of the lanthanide ions have resulted in tuning the emission color to generate white-light as well as sense a host of cations, anions and small mols. alike.  The permanent porosity has also been used to apply these frameworks as gas storage and sepn. materials.  The exciting magnetic property of the lanthanide-org. frameworks arises from the high orbital contribution and single-ion anisotropy of the lanthanide ions.  This eventually ushers the slow relaxation of magnetization with high energy barrier making such systems potential candidates for future magnetic sensory and memory devices.  This review will discuss the porous properties of lanthanide-org. frameworks and the progress in utilizing them in gas storage and sensing properties.

The 1st isomer, with a paddle-wheel-type Cd2(COO)4 secondary building unit (SBU), is flexible, whereas the other isomer has a rigid framework based on a \u03bc-oxo-bridged Cd2(\u03bc-OCO)2 SBU.  Both frameworks are 2-fold interpenetrated and the pore surface is decorated with pendant -NH2 and =N-N= functional groups.  Both the frameworks are nonporous to N2, revealed by the type II adsorption profiles.  However, at 195 K, the 1st isomer shows an unusual double-step hysteretic CO2 adsorption profile, whereas the 2nd isomer shows a typical type I CO2 profile.  Also, at 195 K, both frameworks show excellent selectivity for CO2 among other gases (N2, O2, H2, and Ar), which has been correlated to the specific interaction of CO2 with the -NH2 and =N-N= functionalized pore surface.  DFT calcns. for the oxo-bridged isomer unveiled that the -NH2 group is the primary binding site for CO2.  The high heat of CO2 adsorption (\u0394Hads = 37.7 kJ mol-1) in the oxo-bridged isomer is realized by NH2-CO2/arom. \u03c0-CO2 and cooperative CO2-CO2 interactions.  Further, postsynthetic modification of the -NH2 group into -NHCOMe in the 2nd isomer leads to a reduced CO2 uptake with lower binding energy, which establishes the crit. role of the -NH2 group for CO2 capture.
