As expected, the adsorption affinities at low loadings follow the same order as for an open graphite surface (i.e., B < T < X) because the enhancement in the adsorption potential in a confined space works equally for all adsorbates. However, when the pore is completely filled with adsorbate, benzene has a higher capacity than toluene and xylene. The pore densities are calculated as moles per unit accessible volume (the accessible pore volumes are listed in Table ", "3", "), and even though benzene has the highest accessible pore volume its pore density is still greater than those of toluene and xylene. This is tantamount to saying that the packing is more efficient for benzene than for aromatics with side chains. If we express the adsorptive capacity in terms of mass of adsorbate per unit accessible volume (Figure ", "6", "b), the order of the capacity at high loadings is opposite to when it is expressed in terms of moles (B < T < X). This conclusion remains valid for pores having a width greater than 12 \u00c5. However, for ultramicropores smaller than 12 \u00c5, the order for the capacity by mole and mass at low loadings remains the same as that for pores whose widths are greater than 12 \u00c5 (B < T < X), but the opposite is observed at high loadings (B > T > X).

Both the expts. and the simulations show a markedly different temp. dependence of the retention for the n-alkanes compared to the arenes.
