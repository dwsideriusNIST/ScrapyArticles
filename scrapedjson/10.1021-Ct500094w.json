In this regard, it would be helpful to evaluate the performance of these materials by molecular simulation techniques prior to experimental synthesis. A prerequisite to making reliable predictions of relevant thermodynamic and transport properties of gas molecules adsorbed in these materials is that we can accurately describe the interactions of these gas molecules with the atoms of the materials.

The characteristic of this method is that we only calculate DFT energies on specific paths that are most sensitive to their corresponding pairwise interactions between approached pairs. Compared to methods that use genetic algorithms, this reduces the number of required ab initio calculations. In addition, we use an energy decomposition scheme in combination with a self-consistent optimization loop, which allows us to fit only two parameters at the same time. Our method therefore significantly reduces the computational cost to develop ab initio force fields and is relatively simple to be implemented. Part of the gain in efficiency is due to the fact that our approach uses one of the common force fields (e.g., UFF) as a starting point and aims to correct these. We have also tested the robustness of this methodology by showing that the predicted adsorption properties of the derived force fields are insensitive to the choice of the initial force fields. We anticipate that this methodology can be generally applicable for metal\u2013organic frameworks or even some other classes of porous materials.

In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its abs. values, as it is currently done with mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  We formally demonstrate that the new functional reduces to the conventional error functional used in mol.

For the periodic calcn. of isolated mols., the REPEAT charges are found to be in good agreement with those detd. with established mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional mol. ESP approaches generate 'unphys.' charges, whereas the REPEAT method produces charges that are both chem. intuitive and consistent between different periodic electronic structure packages.  The new approach is employed to generate partial at. charges of various microporous materials and compared to both exptl. derived and mol. fragment ESP charges.

(GGA) type for general chem. applications termed B97-D is proposed.  It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6\u00b7R-6.  A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common d. functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported.  The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on std. thermochem. benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked arom. mols. and group II element clusters, and for the computation of mol. geometries.  Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for std. functionals.  In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean abs. deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1.  The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the av. CCSD(T) accuracy.  The basic strategy in the development to restrict the d. functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interat. distances by damped C6\u00b7R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions.  As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference.  From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chem. method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XhtFenu7bO&md5=0b4aa16bebc3a0a2ec175d4b161ab0e4", "30.

Calcd. values of \u0394H0, including an empirical correction for dispersion forces, resulted to be in a reasonably good agreement with those exptl. obtained.  Calcns. also showed the very significant role played by dispersion forces, which account for \u223c1/2 of the adsorption enthalpy for each of the three adsorbates, CO, N2, and CO2.  The results are discussed in the broader context of the adsorption of the same gases on other MOFs and also on zeolites.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXmvF2rtLc%253D&md5=db5cd7db68300444ed0ca16a92df23bf"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0013.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0014.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0015.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0016.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2014/jctcce.2014.10.issue-4/ct500094w/production/images/small/ct-2014-00094w_0010.gif\">"]}
