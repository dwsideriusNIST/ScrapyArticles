{"abstract": "", "text": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04185 In the original article, we reported \u0394F stability values between two phases of a COMOC-2 MOF. In calculating the values reported (kJ/mol), an incorrect unit cell mass was used. The unit cell mass of vanadium COMOC-2 used in this correction is 1228.6 g/mol (C56H32O20V4). Accordingly, Table 1 of the mentioned article should be replaced with the table reported in this correction. We note that this correction has no effect on the simulation results we have reported because all calculations were made on a mass basis. We acknowledge S. J. Lee and Y. S. Bae from the Yonsei University in South Korea for notifying us of this error.Table 1. \u0394F = Flp \u2013 Fnp (kJ/mol)aT (K)methaneethaneethylenepropanepropylene281.5X43413240293X41574746303X42463633a\u0394F was calculated as the average from the isotherm-based calculations of \u0394FLTP and \u0394FUTP.Reference QuickViewTop of PageAbstractReferencesReferencesThis article references 1 other publications.Couck, S.; Van Assche, T.
