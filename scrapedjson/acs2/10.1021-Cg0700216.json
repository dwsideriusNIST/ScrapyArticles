", "text": "10.1021/cg0700216  Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsSupporting Information AvailableIntroduction The construction of metal\u2212organic frameworks (MOFs) has become an exciting and expanding approach to novel materials.1 The interest is stimulated not only by the MOFs' fine-tuning structure diversity but also by their extensively potential applications in such areas as separation, molecular recognition, ion exchange, gas sorption and storage, nonlinear optics, magnetics, and catalysis.1,2 Deeply understanding the topology structural aspects of high-dimensional MOFs is one of the most important subjects because it will ultimately accelerate the discovery of new MOF materials for application.1,2  To date, the topologies of many three-dimensional (3D) MOFs generally can be analyzed and categorized with some natural prototypes in metallic or binary inorganic solids.3 For example, recently, the corresponding MOFs' replica of \u03b1-Po,4 NbO,5 Pt3O4,6 PtS,7 CdSO4,8 CaB2,9 SrSi2,10 diamond,11 feldspar,12 boracite,13 perovskite,14 pyrite,15 quartz,16 rutile,17 sodalite,18 tungsten bronze,19 fluorite,3 anatase,20 and zeolite21 have been explored gradually. In these mimic and many other 3D MOFs without mineral prototypes, the connectivity of the building blocks exceeding six remains scarce because of the metal centers' limited coordination numbers and the steric hindrance for ligands.3,22,23 Nevertheless, such drawbacks can be overcome by using large polynuclear clusters instead of simple metal centers as the nodes because the polynuclear cluster-based nodes generally possess larger sizes, more coordination sites, and smaller steric hindrance for ligands with respect to the simple d- or f-block metal center nodes.3,22 Herein, we report by using the \u03bc3-hydroxyl-bridged tetranuclear cobalt(II) cluster [Co4(OH)2]6+ as the node and the mixed ligands N,N\u2018-oxamidobis(benzoato) (obbz2-, Scheme 1) and 4,4\u2018-bypyridine (4,4\u2018-bpy) as the links. A non-interpenetrating 3D MOF with a new eight-connected 364145464 topology, [Co4(OH)2(obbz)3(4,4\u2018-bpy)2](4,4\u2018-bpy) (1), was obtained under hydrothermal conditions; interestingly, another 3D MOF, [Co3(H2O)(obbz)3(4,4\u2018-bpy)2](H2O)2 (2), was formed when a lower hydrothermal temperature was applied to the same reaction mixture, which shows a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D four-connected (6, 4) distorted diamond network structure based on not only the binuclear cluster node [Co2(\u03bc2-H2O)]4+ but also the mononuclear node Co2+. Interestingly, obbz2- ligand in both complexes adopts the trans-configuration, whereas previously reported obbz complexes generally contain the cis-obbz ligand,24,25 in which not only the carboxylato group but also the oxamido group take part in the coordination roles, and the valence of obbz in the latter is \u22124.

Materials and Methods. The precursor H2obbz was prepared according to the published procedures.24 Other starting materials were commercially available and used as received without further purification. The elemental analyses were performed on a Heraeus Chn-Rapid elemental analyzer. The infrared spectra were recorded on a Pekin-Elmer 2000 spectrophotometer with pressed KBr pallets. The magnetic susceptibility measurements for 1 and 2 were carried out on polycrystalline samples (15.69 mg of 1 and 19.58 mg of 2) on a Quantum Design MPMS-XL5 SQUID magnetometer in the temperature range of 2\u2212300K. Diamagnetic corrections were estimated from Pascal's constants for all constituent atoms.26  Preparation of [Co4(OH)2(obbz)3(4,4\u2018-bpy)2](4,4\u2018-bpy) (1). A mixture of H2obbz(1.0 mmol), Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O (2.0 mmol), 4, 4\u2018-bipy (2.0 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for 20 min. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (20 mL) and kept at 160 \u00b0C for 6 days. After the autoclave had cooled to room temperature over 6\u22127 h, purple octahedral crystalline solids of 1 were isolated from the mother liquid, washed with water, and then dried at ambient temperature (35% yield based on cobalt).

A total of 11062 reflections were collected in the range 1.90\u00b0 < \u03b8 < 27.52\u00b0 (\u221227 \u2264 h \u2264 27, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 9, \u221228 \u2264 l \u2264 28), of which 6880 are unique (Rint = 0.0939) and 4799 with I > 2\u03c3(I) were used in the refinement of the structure of 2. Empirical absorption corrections from \u03c6 scan were applied. Cell parameters were obtained by the global refinement of the positions of all collected reflections for two complexes. Both structures were solved by direct methods and refined by a full matrix least-squares technique based on F2 using the SHELXL 97 program.

Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsSupporting Information AvailableResults and Discussion Syntheses. Both new 3D MOFs were synthesized using the same reaction mixture of H2obbz(1.0 mmol), Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O (2.0 mmol), 4,4\u2018-bipy (2.0 mmol), and H2O (10.0 mL), but different hydrothermal temperatures were applied:\u2009 the non-interpenetrating 1 was obtained at 160 \u00b0C, whereas the 2-fold interpenetrating 2 was formed at 140 \u00b0C, suggesting that the hydrothermal temperatures have critical impact on the construction of 3D MOFs. It is noted that the change of the hydrothermal temperatures to obtain 3D MOFs' interpenetrating and non-interpenetrating structures was rarely performed before, although several MOFs tuned by the hydrothermal temperatures had been documented.27 Previous research suggested using large inorganic clusters as the second building units (SBUs)28 or suitable guest molecules as the templates1e,1i,1j could generate non-interpenetrating networks, so the large \u03bc3-hydroxyl bridged tertranuclear cobalt(II) cluster [Co4(OH)2]6+ being utilized as the SBU and the existence of 4,4\u2018-bpy guest molecules maybe are responsible for the non-interpenetrating structure of 1. On the other hand, it is also noteworthy that obbz4- ligand24,25 or halogen-substituted obbz4- ligand29 in previously reported complexes always adopt the cis-configuration and not only the carboxylato group but also the oxamido group take part in the coordination roles, however, only the carboxylato group of obbz2- ligand in both 1 and 2 are involved with the connection of metal centers, so obbz2- ligand with the trans-configuration in 1 and 2 actually acts as a long spacer.  Crystal Structures. (a) Complex 1. The crystal structure of 1 exhibits a 3D network composed of the tetranuclear cluster nodes [Co4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+, 4,4\u2018-bpy bridging ligands, and obbz2- bridging ligands(Figure 1). Two \u03bc3-hydroxyl groups bridge four cobalt(II) atoms to form the centrosymmetric tetranuclear cluster [Co4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ as the node. There are two crystallographic independent cobalt(II) atoms:\u2009 Co1 adopts a distorted octahedral [O5N] coordination geometry with three carboxylato oxygen atoms from three obbz2- ligands, two \u03bc3-hydroxyl groups, and one nitrogen atom of a 4,4\u2018-bpy ligand, whereas Co2 exhibits a distorted tetrahedral [O3N] coordination environment, which is coordinated by two carboxylato oxygen atoms from two obbz2- ligands, one \u03bc3-hydroxyl group, and one nitrogen atom of a 4,4\u2018-bpy ligand. The Co1\u2212N bond distance of 2.108(3)\u00c5 is a little  larger than the Co2\u2212N bond length of 2.026(3) \u00c5, and the Co1\u2212O bond distances (from 2.070(2) to 2.178(3) \u00c5) are larger than the Co2\u2212O bond lengths (from 1.943(3) to 1.968(3) \u00c5). The molecular formula of 1 is confirmed by the bond-valence sums' calculation,30 which indicates that the valences of Co1 and Co2 are +1.972 and +1.943, respectively. It is noteworthy that the cluster [Co4(OH)2]6+ in 1 is the only example constructed from four cobalt atoms showing not only the octahedral geometry but also the tetrahedral coordination environment, although many other \u03bc3-oxygen-bridged tetranuclear cobalt clusters that generally possess only one type of coordination configuration had been observed before.31   Figure 1 Bridging ligands coordinating the cluster node [Co4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ in 1 (a) and projection of the 3D network of 1 down the b-axis (b).   Each tetranuclear cluster node [Co4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ is coordinated by 10 bridging ligands (including four 4,4\u2018-bpy ligands and six obbz2- ligands) but linked to only eight nearest neighbors because of two pairs of 4,4\u2018-bpy ligands acting as two \u201cdouble bridges\u201d(Figure 1b). This affords a 3D eight-connected framework structure, which is not of the familiar CsCl-type. The CsCl-type structure is constructed from perpendicularly intersected 2D (4, 4) nets by sharing the diagonal, showing an eight-connected 42464 topology, 23a whereas the topology structure of 1 can be considered as being composed of 2D (3, 6) nets parallel to the bc-plane, which intersect with two types of 2D (4, 4) nets parallel to the ab-plane but arranged alternatively in a staggered way (Figure 2). The (3, 6) net and two types of (4, 4) nets share the arris along the c-axis direction to generate an eight-connected structure, which comprises linked lattices with dimensions of about 13.8 \u00d7 12.7 \u00d7 12.9 \u00c53. The formed 1D channels along the b-axis are occupied by the guest 4,4\u2018-bpy molecules. Interestingly, from another view-angle, the structures of both 1 and CsCl can be considered to comprise (4, 4) nets, which are cross-linked by zigzag chains displaced by translation:\u2009 in CsCl, the zigzag chains bridge across the diagonal of the parallel (4, 4) nets, 23b whereas in 1, the zigzag chains bridge the border parallel to the b-axis of two types of (4, 4) nets that are alternatively arranged parallel to the ab-plane(Figure 2). The Sch\u00e4lfli symbol32 for the net of 1 is 364145464; this 8-coordinated net was analyzed using Systre (gavrog.org), indicating that it is completely new within the reported 3D MOFs (this means it is not found in RCSR, see rcsr.anu.edu.au), and it possesses the symmetry Cccm, which is clearly a subnet of the 10-coordinated RCSR net bct. The topology of another recently reported 3D non-natural eight-connected MOF, La(L)4(ClO4)3 (L = 4, 4\u2018-bipyridine-N,N\u2018-dioxide),23b is constructed from parallel (4, 4) nets and cross-linked zigzag chains too; however, the neighboring zigzag chains are displaced by translation with a rotation angle of 61.5\u00b0. One zigzag chain bridges across the diagonal, whereas its translation analog bridges the border of the (4, 4) net, displaying an eight-connected topology of 334155862. To the best of our knowledge, 1 also represents the first 3D eight-connected MOF constructed from tetranuclear transition metal cluster nodes and mixed bridging ligands. Another quite recently reported 3D MOF [Cd3(bdc)3(L)2(H2O)2] (bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; L = 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butane) is a self-penetrating coordination framework composed of trinuclear cadmium clusters as the nodes and mixed ligands 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butane as the bridges, exhibiting an interesting eight-connected 42068 topology.33   Figure 2 Schematic representation of the 364145464 topology of 1 viewed down the b-axis; the short and long links represent double 4,4\u2018-bpy ligands and obbz2- ligand, respectively.   (b) Complex 2. The architecture of 3D homometallic coordination polymers based on both dinuclear cluster node and mononuclear node is extremely rare. However, not only the dinuclear cluster node [Co2(\u03bc2-H2O)]4+ but also the mononuclear node Co2+ are observed in 2, which are connected by 4,4\u2018-bpy and obbz2- bridging ligands, generating a 3D extended structure(Figure 3). There are two crystallographic independent cobalt(II) atoms:\u2009 Co1 possesses a slightly distorted octahedral [O5N] coordination environment, which comprised three carboxylato oxygen atoms from three obbz2- ligands, one nitrogen atom of a 4,4\u2018-bpy ligand, one terminal hydrate molecule, and one bridging hydrate molecule, whereas Co2 is coordinated in a distorted octahedral [O4N2] geometry, with four carboxylato oxygen atoms from two obbz2- ligands and two nitrogen atoms from two 4,4\u2018-bpy ligands. Co1 and its symmetry equivalent Co1#1(#1 \u2212x + 1, y, \u2212z + 1/2) are one hydrate molecule bridged, with a Co1\u00b7\u00b7 Co1#1 distance of 3.61 \u00c5 and a Co1\u2212Ohydrate\u2212Co1*1 bond angle of 113.9\u00b0, forming the dinuclear cluster node [Co2(\u03bc2-H2O)]4+, whereas Co2 acts as the mononuclear node.  The Co2\u2212O8 bond distance of 2.039(4) \u00c5 is obviously smaller than that of Co2\u2212O7 (2.243(4) \u00c5), but compared with the Co1\u2212Ocarboxylato bond lengths (average 2.058(3)\u00c5), whereas the Co1\u2212N1 bond distance of 2.143(4)\u00c5 is a little larger than the Co2\u2212N bond lengths (2.092(4) \u00c5). The bond-valence sums' calculation30 gives the valence of Co1 as +2.055, whereas the valence of Co2 is +1.887, affirming that H2O rather than OH is the \u03bc2-O bridging unit between Co1 and Co1#1 (#1 \u2212x + 1, y, \u2212z + 1/2).   Figure 3 Fragment of the structure of 2 (a) and one of 2-fold interpenetrating networks in 2 viewed down the c-axis (b).   Each dinuclear cluster node [Co2(\u03bc2-H2O)]4+ is only four-connected, although it is coordinated by six bridging ligands, which include two 4,4\u2018-bpy ligands and two pairs of obbz2- ligands acting as two double bridges. The mononuclear node Co2+ is also four-connected, but links to each other by single obbz2- ligand. Although the dinuclear node [Co2(\u03bc2-H2O)]4+ links to the mononuclear node Co2+ through a 4,4\u2018-bpy bridging ligand. Consequently, a self-penetrating 3D framework is formed (Figures 3 and 4). To fully appreciate this network structure, we present the topology of node\u2212node connections as Figure 4, which exhibits a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D (6, 4) distorted diamond network with the Sch\u00e4lfli symbol of 66. All four-connected nodes in the diamond structure possess an ideal tetrahedral connection configuration, whereas the (6, 4) network in 2 is constructed from two types of four-connected nodes:\u2009 the mononuclear node Co2+ (red, Figure 4) with a distorted tetrahedral connection geometry, and the dinuclear cluster node [Co2(\u03bc2-H2O)]4+ (blue, Figure 4) possessing a special \u201cquaternity truss\u201d connection configuration, where its four linked neighbors are located at the same side. As a result, a new 3D (6, 4) network structure is formed.   Figure 4 Schematic representations of the 66 topology based on mononuclear node (in red)\u2212dinuclear node (in blue) connections in 2 (viewed down the Y-axis), the blue\u2212red, blue, and red links represent 4,4\u2018-bpy ligand, single obbz2- ligand, and double obbz2- ligands, respectively, (a) and two interpenetrating 3D networks in 2 (viewed down the Z-axis), one of which is shown as green for clarity (b).   There are extensive intramolecular hydrogen bonds among the oxamido group and the carboxylato groups within obbz2- ligand (N(3)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(2), 2.575(5) \u00c5; N(3)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(6), 2.613(5) \u00c5; N(4)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(3), 2.622(5) \u00c5; N(4)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(5), 2.707(5) \u00c5; N(5)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(8), 2.609(5) \u00c5; N(5)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(9)#2, 2.652(6) \u00c5; #2 \u2212x, \u2212y \u2212 1, \u2212z + 1), between the bridging hydrate molecule and the carboxylato group in obbz2- ligand (O(1W)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(2)#3, 2.511(4) \u00c5, #3 \u2212x + 1, \u2212y + 1, \u2212z), as well as among the terminal hydrate molecule and the oxamido groups in obbz2- ligands (O(2W)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(6)#4, 2.835(6) \u00c5; O(2W)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O(5)#5, 2.740(6) \u00c5; #4 x, \u2212y + 1, z + 1/2; *5 \u2212x + 1, y, \u2212z + 1/2). These weak interactions play important roles in the stabilization of the crystal structure of 2.  Magnetic Properties. The magnetic susceptibilities of complexes 1 and 2 have been investigated. For 1, the product \u03c7T continuously decreases upon cooling (Figure 5), indicating an overall antiferromagntic (AF) coupling between the adjacent Co2+ ions. At room temperature, the \u03c7T value is 8.45 emu K mol-1, which is larger than the value of 7.5 emu K mol-1 expected for four isolated spin-only S = 3/2 Co2+ cations (assuming g = 2). The 1/\u03c7 data above 100 K follow the Curie\u2212Weiss law well, with C = 11.41 emu K mol-1 and \u03b8 = \u2212102.8 K. The large negative Weiss constant suggests a net strong AF coupling among Co2+ ions. Because of the extreme difficulty of modeling the tetranuclear cobalt(II) cluster system with four  different J, 31a it is also impossible to fit the magnetic data of the more complicated 1 given current theory, even if the Co2+ centers are orbitally degenerate. For 2, the observed \u03c7T value of 8.60 emu K mol-1 at 300 K is slightly smaller than the expected value of 8.79 emu K mol-1 for three non-interacting S = 3/2 Co2+ cations (assuming g = 2.5). The \u03c7T value decreases slightly to 8.12 emu K mol-1 at 100 K, and then dramatically decreases to 2.79 emu K mol-1 at 2 K (Figure 6). Best-fitting the data with the Curie\u2212Weiss law gives C = 8.87 emu K mol-1 and a negative \u03b8 value of \u22129.9 K. The C value corresponds to g = 2.51, which is significantly larger than the spin-only value, being attributed to the orbital contribution of high spin Co(II) ions in the octahedral environment, but is consistent with the values observed in many other high spin octahedral Co(II) complexes.26 The slight decrease of \u03c7T value in high-temperature range does not imply an antiferromagnetic coupling between Co(II) ions, as it is mainly due to the single-ion behavior of Co(II) ion.

Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsSupporting Information AvailableConclusions Two novel 3D MOFs containing polynuclear cluster nodes and mixed bridging ligands, [Co4(OH)2(obbz)3(4,4\u2018-bpy)2](4,4\u2018-bpy) (1) and [Co3(H2O)(obbz)3(4,4\u2018-bpy)2](H2O)2(2), have been hydrothermally synthesized and characterized. 1 exhibits a unique 3D eight-connected 364145464 topology structure based on the tetranuclear cobalt(II) cluster node [Co4(\u03bc3-OH)2]6+ and mixed bridging ligands, whereas 2 possesses a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D distorted diamond network structure constructed from not only the binuclear cluster node [Co2(\u03bc2-H2O)]4+ but also the mononuclear node Co2+. This study demonstrates that using polynuclear transition metal cluster node and mixed bridging ligands can provide 3D MOFs with novel topology structures, and the hydrothermal technique can be utilized to obtain quite different 3D MOFs by controlling the temperatures only.
