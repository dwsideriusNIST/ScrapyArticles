{"abstract": "The performance of metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) in humid or aqueous environments is a topic of great significance for a variety of applications ranging from adsorption separations to gas storage. While a number of water-stable MOFs have emerged recently in the literature, the majority of MOFs are known to have poor water stability compared to zeolites and activated carbons, and there is therefore a critical need to perform systematic water-stability studies and characterize MOFs comprehensively after water exposure. Using these studies we can isolate the specific factors governing the structural stability of MOFs and direct the future synthesis efforts toward the construction of new, water-stable MOFs. In this work, we have extended our previous work on the systematic water-stability studies of MOFs and synthesized new, cobalt-, nickel-, copper-, and zinc-based, water-stable, pillared MOFs by incorporating structural factors such as ligand sterics and catenation into the framework. Stability is assessed by using water vapor adsorption isotherms along with powder X-ray diffraction patterns and results from BET modeling of N adsorption isotherms before and after water exposure. As expected, our study demonstrates that unlike the parent DMOF structures (based on Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn metals), which all collapse under 60% relative humidity (RH), their corresponding tetramethyl-functionalized variations (DMOF-TM) are remarkably stable, even when adsorbing more than 20 mmol of HO/g of MOF at 80% RH. This behavior is due to steric factors provided by the methyl groups grafted on the BDC (benzenedicarboxylic acid) ligand, as shown previously for the Zn-based DMOF-TM. Moreover, 4,4\u2032,4\u2033,4\u2034-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrabenzoic acid based, pillared MOFs (based on Co and Zn metals) are also found to be stable after 90% RH exposure, even when the basicity of the bipyridyl-based pillar ligand is low. This is due to the presence of catenation in their frameworks, similar to MOF-508 (Zn-BDC-BPY), which has also been reported to be stable after exposure to 90% RH.", "text": "10.1021/la503269f Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionReferences1 IntroductionMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by the self-assembly of organic ligands and metal-containing nodes.(1) MOFs have garnered much attention in a variety of fields related to porous materials, such as sensing,(1, 2) adsorption-based gas storage,(1-7) gas separation,(1, 2, 5, 7-10) catalysis,(1-3, 5, 7, 11) and drug delivery.(1, 2, 11) This is due to their record-breaking values of surface area and pore volume, facile pore tunability, and almost infinite set of structure possibilities with diverse topologies. While a number of water-stable MOFs have recently been synthesized in the literature, many MOFs exhibit poor stability under humid and aqueous conditions that restrict their potential use in industrial applications, such as air purification, CO2 capture, and catalysis.(12) Thermodynamically, water being a more basic ligand (pKa \u223c15.7), it can often displace the less basic organic ligands (typically carboxylates) coordinated to the metal centers and, hence, can breakdown the framework.Despite the significance of this issue, the literature consists of relatively few systematic water-stability studies for MOFs.(13-29) Moreover, the prevailing literature is rather scattered in the type of water exposure conditions, and the particular characterization techniques used to quantify the water stability of MOFs experimentally vary significantly among publications. In most of the studies reported,(30-48) MOFs are exposed to ambient air in the lab or soaked in liquid water, but water adsorption isotherms are rarely reported, and postexposure powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) alone is widely used to characterize MOFs. PXRD is a simple technique that provides information about the long-range crystallinity of the structure, though it is not capable of detecting short-range surface collapse. Hence, it is a qualitative technique and not a comprehensive way to characterize MOFs after water exposure. This has led to misleading conclusions about the water stability of MOFs. For example, Jasuja and Walton(19) and Liu et al.(44) reported contrasting observations about the stability of MOF-508 (Zn-BDC-BPY), with the former highlighting the need for surface area analysis in addition to PXRD to reach a conclusion with a higher confidence level.Overall, it has been seen that the strength of the bond between the metal centers and the ligand is a strong indicator of the MOF hydrothermal stability.(16) Carboxylate-ligand-based MOFs, such as MOF-5 and UMCM-1, are highly unstable under humid conditions due to the low basicity (pKa) of carboxylate ligands and the low coordination number of their metal centers (only four-coordinated).(16, 17, 49, 50) However, some other carboxylate-ligand-based MOFs, such as UiO-66(Zr),(32) MIL-125(Ti),(27) PCN-56-59(Zr),(45) DUT-51,67-69,(28, 46) and MIL-140(Zr),(47) have been reported to be water-stable due to the high oxophilicity and coordination number of their metal centers (eight-coordinated).(16) Similarly, other carboxylate-based MOFs, such as MIL-53(Cr)(21) and MIL-101(Cr),(39) are water-stable, as their metal centers are inert toward water, and hence, now MOF hydrolysis is unfavorable. Imidazolate(30, 39) (pKa \u223c18.6) and pyrazolate(31, 42) (pKa  \u223c19.8) based MOFs are highly stable under humid or aqueous environments, as the pKa values of these nitrogen-coordinating ligands are higher than that of water (pKa \u223c15.7).Although the impact of water adsorption and its subsequent effect on the thermodynamic stability of MOF structures could be defined by the acid\u2013base effects of metal centers and ligands, hydrophobicity and ligand sterics are also important in defining the kinetic stability of MOFs, as they can increase the activation energy barrier for the hydrolysis reaction. Ligand functionalization is a promising approach for manipulating the kinetic factors that play a significant role in the stability of the framework. It has been reported earlier that MOF stability in humid environments can be improved by incorporating hydrophobic functional groups,(20, 25, 29, 33-38, 43, 48) such as alkyl or fluorinated groups, but there is a need to decouple hydrophobicity from steric effects by measuring water adsorption isotherms. Taylor et al.(25) argued that CALF-25 adsorbs appreciable amounts of water, unlike highly hydrophobic fluorous metal\u2013organic frameworks (FMOFs) such as FMOF-1,(29) and is still water resistant, as the nonpolar alkyl functional groups provide steric protection to the metal centers. However, in the majority of the reports,(30-38) water adsorption isotherms have not been measured; e.g., Ma et al.(33) showed that adding methyl groups at the 2,2\u2032-positions on BPY results in a more stable structure (SCUTC-18) than adding methyl groups at the 3,3\u2032-positions (SCUTC-19) without reporting water adsorption isotherms. Hence, it is difficult to conclude whether the MOF is now inherently more stable due to a change in ligand sterics or is stable simply due to the increase in hydrophobicity as a result of functionalization with nonpolar groups. Thus, there is a critical requirement in the MOF field to perform systematic water-stability studies, and water-exposed MOFs should be characterized comprehensively so that we can isolate the specific factors governing structural stability of MOFs and direct the future synthesis efforts toward the construction of new, water-stable MOFs.The explanation of the MOF degradation mechanisms under humid environments is a very complex problem, because there are various independent factors that play a critical role in the stability of MOFs. To decouple the effects of metal\u2013ligand coordination environment, topology, porosity, metal-type, and ligand-type on the structural stability of MOFs, studies on isostructural series of MOFs are needed in order to systematically study the impact of each specific factor on the MOF water stability by only varying that specific factor. The effect of the metal-type incorporated in MOF systems, such as MOF-74 and DMOF, on the water stability was examined by Liu et al.(26) and Tan et al.,(15) respectively. It was reported that for both MOF systems, the Ni-based variation (Ni-DMOF and Ni-MOF-74) was less vulnerable to hydrolysis. Ni2+ has the lowest standard reduction potential among the metals considered in these studies, which makes it less likely for the metal center to react with water.(26) Along the same lines, the water stability of MOF-5 is shown to increase upon doping with Ni2+.(51) We have recently shown that the water-unstable Zn-DMOF structure can be made kinetically stable by functionalizing benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) with nonpolar groups, as these groups introduce sterics factors around the metal centers.(18) In other work,(19) we also reported that catenation in pillared MOFs can improve the water resistance of MOFs even when the basicity of the pillar ligand is reduced. Catenation is the interpenetration of two or more identical and independent frameworks (Figure 1a).(7) This catenation can make the ligand displacement difficult by locking it in place within the framework.Figure 1.

(b) Carboxylate (top) and diamine pillar (bottom) ligands used in this work.In this work, we have extended our previous work(18, 19, 52) by synthesizing new, cobalt-, nickel-, copper-, and zinc-based, water-stable, pillared MOFs of similar topology [Figures S1 (Supporting Information) and 1a] using 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (TMBDC) and 4,4\u2032,4\u2033,4\u2034-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrabenzoic acid (BTTB) as carboxylate ligands and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and 2,2\u2032-dimethyl-4,4\u2032-bipyridine (DMBPY) as pillar ligands (Figure 1b). The longer diamine ligand (DMBPY) leads to two-fold catenation [Figures 1a and S1c (Supporting Information)] in the framework. Experiments were performed to measure water adsorption isotherms at 25 \u00b0C and 1 bar. PXRD patterns and results from BET modeling(53) of N2 adsorption isotherms at \u2212196 \u00b0C were compared before and after water exposure to determine the impact of water adsorption and its subsequent effect on the stability of MOF structures.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionReferences2 Experimental Section2.1MaterialsAll the chemicals employed in this work were commercially available and used as-received without further purification from the following sources: Sigma-Aldrich, N,N-diethylformamide (DEF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 4,4\u2032,4\u2033,4\u2034-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrabenzoic acid (BTTB); Chem Service Inc., 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (TMBDC); Acros, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), ethanol (EtOH); Angene Internationals Ltd, 2,2\u2032-dimethyl-4,4\u2032-bipyridine (DMBPY).All the new, pillared MOFs reported in this work are summarized in Figure 2 and were synthesized solvothermally. Metal ions and carboxylate ligands form the 2-D sheets, while diamine ligands act as pillars connecting these 2-D sheets in the third dimension [Figures 1a and S1 (Supporting Information)]. Detailed synthesis procedures are summarized below.Figure 2. New, water-stable, pillared MOFs synthesized in this work.2.1.1M-DMOF-TM (where M = Co, Ni, Cu)M(TMBDC)(DABCO)0.5 or M-DMOF-TM structures were prepared with slight modification from the report of Chun et al.(54) for Zn-DMOF-TM; i.e., 0.63 mmol of metal salt [Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O], 0.63 mmol of TMBDC ligand, and 0.31 mmol of DABCO ligand were dissolved in 15 mL DMF and left stirring for 3 h at room temperature. The resulting solution was filtered and the filtrate was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor and placed in a preheated oven at 120 \u00b0C for 48 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature in air, and the resulting solid was filtered and repeatedly washed with DMF. Activated samples of M-DMOF-TM were prepared by heating the as-synthesized samples at 110 \u00b0C overnight under vacuum.2.1.2M-BTTB-DMBPY (where M = Co, Zn)M(BTTB)0.5(DMBPY)0.5 or M-BTTB-DMBPY structures were prepared as suggested by Karra(52) for M-BTTB-BPY; i.e., 0.2 mmol of metal salt [Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O], 0.1 mmol of BTTB ligand, and 0.1 mmol of DMBPY ligand were dissolved in 5 mL of DEF/ethanol/water (2:2:1, v/v). Two drops of 1 N HCl were added to the mixture, and the final mixture was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor and placed in a preheated oven at 100 \u00b0C for 96 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature in air, and the resulting solid was filtered and repeatedly washed with DEF. Activated samples were prepared by performing solvent exchange with chloroform and then evacuation overnight under vacuum at 120 \u00b0C.2.2Characterization2.2.1Single Crystal XRD (X-ray Diffraction)A Bruker APEX II CCD sealed tube diffractometer with Mo K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.710\u200973 \u00c5) radiation and a graphite monochromator was used to collect single crystal X-ray data for Co-BTTB-DMBPY. MOF crystals were mounted on nylon CryoLoops with Paratone-N. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squared techniques using the SHELXTL-97 software suite. Crystallographic details are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S20, Table S1; CCDC 992483 contains the crystallographic information file).2.2.2PXRD (Powder X-ray Diffraction)A X\u2019Pert X-ray PANalytical diffractometer with an X\u2019celerator module and Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5) radiation was used to collect PXRD patterns at room temperature, with a step size of 0.02\u00b0 in 2\u03b8. The phase purity of the as-synthesized MOF samples was confirmed by comparing PXRD patterns with the simulated patterns from single crystal X-ray diffraction (Figures S3\u2013S7, Supporting Information). To determine the impact of water adsorption and its subsequent effect on the stability of the MOF structures, PXRD patterns of as-synthesized samples were compared with patterns of water-exposed samples and regenerated samples (obtained after activating the water exposed samples).2.2.3BET AnalysisA Quadrasorb system from Quantachrome Instruments was used to measure nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Figures S15\u2013S19, Supporting Information) at \u2212196 \u00b0C, and the BET model was fitted to these isotherms so that the BET surface areas could be determined for each activated MOF before and after water exposure. Here, the criteria of Walton and Snurr(53) was used to correctly fit the BET model over the low pressure range (P/Po < 0.05).2.2.4Thermogravimetric AnalysisA NETZSCH STA 449 F1 Jupiter device was used to perform thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the as-synthesized and activated MOF samples (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information) under helium in the temperature range of 30\u2013600 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min and flow rate of 20 mL/min.2.2.5Fourier Transform Infrared SpectroscopyFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the as-synthesized and activated MOF samples (Figures S10\u2013S14, Supporting Information) were recorded with a PerkinElmer Spectrum One as KBr pellets in the range 400\u20134000 cm\u20131. Figures S10\u2013S14 (Supporting Information) confirm the presence of methyl moieties in the frameworks.2.2.6Water Vapor Adsorption IsothermsAn Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer (IGA-3 series, Hiden Isochema) was used to measure water vapor adsorption isotherms at 25 \u00b0C and 1 bar. Prior to water adsorption measurements, the samples (\u223c30\u201340 mg) were activated in situ until no further weight loss was observed. Two mass flow controllers were used to control the relative humidity (RH) by varying the ratio of saturated and dry air. Experiments were conducted only up to 80% or 90% RH so that water condensation did not occur in the equipment. The total gas flow rate was set at 200 cm3/min for all the experiments, and each adsorption/desorption step was given sufficient time (from 15 min to 20 h) to approach equilibrium for all RH points.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionReferences3 Results and Discussion3.1Structure Characterization and Physical PropertiesAmong the new, pillared MOFs synthesized in this work, we could obtain single crystals only for Co-BTTB-DMBPY (Figure S20, Supporting Information). Analysis of Co-BTTB-DMBPY using single crystal XRD shows that this framework has the same topology as the parent M-BTTB-BPY (where M = Co, Zn and BPY = 4,4\u2032-bipyridine) structure synthesized by Karra.(52) Hence, metal paddle-wheel clusters are connected by BTTB ligands to form 2-D layers that are further pillared together by DMBPY ligands, giving rise to a porous 3D framework (CCDC 992483 contains the CIF). Two identical and independent 3D frameworks interpenetrate [Figures 1b and S1c (Supporting Information)] with each other, forming the 2-fold catenated final structure of this series of MOFs. However, DABCO-based, pillared MOFs M-DMOF-TM (where M = Co, Ni, Cu) are noncatenated, similar to the parent Zn-DMOF-TM structure.(54) Since we could obtain a single-crystal structure only for Co-BTTB-DMBPY, we used the simulated patterns of the isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-BTTB-BPY(52) and Zn-DMOF-TM(54) for Zn-BTTB-DMBPY and M-DMOF-TM (where M = Co, Ni, Cu), respectively. PXRD patterns of the as-synthesized M-DMOF-TM MOFs confirm that these materials are isostructural to the parent Zn-DMOF-TM structure (Figure S2, Supporting Information). As expected, N2 adsorption measurements (Figures S15\u2013S19, Supporting Information) at \u2212196 \u00b0C on the activated MOF samples showed typical type I behavior according to the IUPAC classification.(3) Furthermore, we observe that methyl functionalization leads to a reduction in porosity (Table 1) for M-BTTB-DMBPY (where M = Co, Zn) compared to the parent M-BTTB-BPY (where M = Co, Zn),(52) whereas M-DMOF-TM (where M = Co, Ni, Cu) shows porosity similar to the parent Zn-DMOF-TM.(28) TGA analyses of M-DMOF-TM samples show that they all decompose around 310 \u00b0C [Figure S8 (Supporting Information), Table 1], similar to the parent Zn-DMOF-TM material.(54) However, M-BTTB-DMBPY decomposes at a slightly higher temperature of 340 \u00b0C [Figure S9 (Supporting Information), Table 1], since catenated crystal structures display higher thermal stability.(55) FTIR spectra (Figures S10\u2013S14, Supporting Information) for as-synthesized M-DMOF-TM and M-BTTB-DMBPY show peaks around 1680 and 3000 cm\u20131, corresponding to the stretching frequency of C\u2550O bond in DMF/DEF and C\u2013H bond in the methyl moieties attached to the benzene rings, respectively. Upon activation the peak at 1680 cm\u20131 disappears, whereas the peaks near 3000 cm\u20131 are retained. Hence, FTIR spectra (Figures S10\u2013S14, Supporting Information) of pillared MOFs synthesized in this work confirm the presence of methyl moieties in the framework.Table 1.

Figure 3 compares the water vapor adsorption behavior at 25 \u00b0C and 1 bar for M-DMOF-TM with that of the parent Zn-DMOF-TM structure. All of these DABCO-based, noncatenated, pillared MOFs display type V behavior(57) similar to traditional porous materials, such as BPL carbon, SBA-15, and MCM-41.(17) Unlike the parent Zn-DMOF-TM, the Co-, Ni-, and Cu-based variations of DMOF-TM show varying levels of hysteresis and retain some amount of water, even when the stream is switched to dry air (0% RH point in the desorption curve). This is unexpected because in these DABCO-based, pillared MOFs there are no unsaturated metal sites available for water to interact with. Recently, Wu et al.(58) showed that framework defects can have significant impact on adsorption properties of MOFs, and Canivet et al.(59) suggested that hysteresis in water adsorption isotherms of MOFs can be accredited to framework flexibility. It is possible that the M-DMOF-TM (where M = Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) structures also have varying levels of flexibility or defects that create local heterogeneity in the framework and explain the differing water adsorption and desorption behavior. Therefore, the pore-filling step in these MOFs occurs at a different RH point, even when their pore sizes are very similar. Typically, the pore-filling step occurs first (at the lowest levels of RH) for the smallest pore material and last for the largest pore material.(17)Figure 3. Water vapor adsorption isotherms at 25 \u00b0C for desolvated compounds of M-DMOF-TM (closed symbols, adsorption; open symbols, desorption). Lines connecting the adsorption points are to faciliate viewing. *Reported from our previous work.(18)M-DMOF-TM (where M = Co, Ni, Cu) displayed no change in crystallinity (Figure 4) or loss of surface area (Table 1) after exposure to humid conditions similar to the parent Zn-DMOF-TM material, as shown in our previous work.(18, 19) The water vapor adsorption capacities at 80% RH are 20.7 mmol/g (37.2 wt %) for Co-DMOF-TM, 20.5 mmol/g (36.9 wt %) for Ni-DMOF-TM, 21.5 mmol/g (38.8 wt %) for Cu-DMOF-TM, and 22.9 mmol/g (41.2 wt %) for Zn-DMOF-TM. The Co-, Ni-, Cu-, and Zn-based variations of the unfunctionalized DMOF structure have been shown to collapse under 60% RH.(15, 17, 40) However, methyl groups grafted on the BDC ligand in DMOF-TM introduce sterics factors around the metal centers.(18, 19) Hence, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, and Zn-based, tetramethyl-functionalized variations of DMOF (DMOF-TM) are remarkably stable, even when they have very high water vapor adsorption loadings (>20 mmol/g at 80% RH). Only a few MOFs, such as UiO-66, MIL-100(Fe), and MIL-101(Cr), display such stability after adsorbing large amounts of water.(17, 39, 24)Figure 4. PXRD patterns for as-synthesized, water-exposed (after 80% RH), and regenerated (a) Co-DMOF-TM, (b) Ni-DMOF-TM, and (c) Cu-DMOF-TM.Figure 5 shows the water vapor adsorption isotherms at 25 \u00b0C and 1 bar for the BTTB-ligand-based, 2-fold catenated, pillared MOFs. Up to 70% RH, all of these isostructural, pillared MOFs display type VII behavior,(57) similar to MOF-508,(19) and hence, these materials are very hydrophobic. However, at higher RH, the pore-filling step occurs differently in these MOFs. Furthermore, the desorption branch in their isotherms shows varying levels of hysteresis and shows retention of varying amounts of water at the 0% RH point in the desorption curve. This is unexpected, because these BTTB-ligand-based, 2-fold catenated, pillared MOFs are isostructural and have very similar pores. Most likely, along the same lines of M-DMOF-TM (where M = Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, Figure 3), these BTTB-ligand-based MOFs also have varying levels of flexibility or defects, which impact their water adsorption.Figure 5. Water vapor adsorption isotherms at 25 \u00b0C for desolvated compounds of M-BTTB-DMBPY and M-BTTB-BPY (closed symbols, adsorption; open symbols, desorption). Lines connecting the adsorption points are to faciliate viewing. *Reported in our previous work.(52)These BTTB-DMBPY-based, catenated, pillared MOFs are stable even after exposure to 90% RH, as there is negligible change in their surface area and crystallinity (Table 1, Figure 6) similar to the parent BTTB-BPY-based, pillared MOFs.(52) However, noncatenated, pillared MOFs such as DMOF collapse under 60% RH,(15, 17, 40) even when it is synthesized with the DABCO pillar ligand, which is much more basic than the BPY and DMBPY pillar ligands (Table 2). It should be noted that the pKa value of BTTB (Table 2) is very similar to that of the BDC ligand (pKa \u223c 3.73)(60) used for the synthesis of DMOF, and catenated structures are expected to be more stable.(55) Hence, the stability of these BTTB-based, pillared MOFs could be attributed to catenation present in their frameworks, similar to MOF-508, which has been reported(19) to be stable, too, after 90% RH exposure, even when the basicity of the pillar ligand is low (Table 2). Catenation could make the ligand displacement difficult by locking it in place within the framework.Table 2.

In this work, we have used these structural factors to synthesize cobalt-, nickel-, copper-, and zinc-based, new, water-stable, pillared MOFs of similar topologies. Our study shows that, unlike the parent DMOF structure, which collapses under 60% RH, tetramethyl-functionalized variations or DMOF-TM are remarkably stable, even when they have very high water vapor adsorption loadings (> 20 mmol/g at 80% RH). These methyl groups grafted on the BDC ligand introduce steric factors around the metal centers. BTTB-based, pillared MOFs are synthesized with bipyridyl-based, pillar ligands, which have lower basicity than DABCO but are still stable after exposure to 90% RH due to the presence of catenation in their frameworks, similar to MOF-508, which also has been reported to be stable after 90% RH exposure. The results of this work show that by incorporating specific factors governing structural stability into the framework, it is possible to synthesize more water stable MOFs.
