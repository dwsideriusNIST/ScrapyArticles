The lanthanide (4f) complexes usually show intense emission over narrow wavelength ranges and are potentially applicable as fluorescent probes and in electroluminescent devices. Recently, a series of coordination polymers based on lanthanide metal ions and multicarboxylate ligands were reported.(8-12) In particular for H2BDC, two carboxylate groups with a 180\u00b0 angle have less space hindrance, and conjugation with the aromatic ring allows it to become a rigid linker. Compared with H2BDC, H2ADB is provided by the 4-methylphenylazo and is highly conjugative. Therefore, through investigating these compounds constructed by two ligands, we may obtain some beneficial information about the structures and properties. Here, we employ the diffusion method to assemble lanthanide ions with H2BDC or H2ADB into porous coordination polymers: [Ln6(BDC)9(DMF)6(H2O)3\u00b73DMF]n [Ln = La, 1; Ce, 2; Nd, 3], [Ln2(BDC)3(DMF)2(H2O)2]n [Ln = Y, 4; Dy, 5; Eu, 6], [Ln2(ADB)3(DMSO)4\u00b76DMSO\u00b78H2O]n [Ln = Ce, 7; Sm, 8; Eu, 9; Gd, 10]. By changing the temperature, we also obtained {[Ce3(ADB)3(HADB)3]\u00b730DMSO\u00b729H2O}n (11) and [Ce2(ADB)3(H2O)3]n (12).Top of PageAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionExperimental SectionReferencesResults and DiscussionDiscription of the structuresCompound 6 and the  isomorphous structures for 4, 5, and 7\u221210 were respectively described by Sun, Yaghi, etc.;(12a, 13) here, we only reported the IR, TGA, luminescence, and magnetic properties for these compounds. Single X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1\u22123 possess the same 3D architecture. Therefore, the structures of 1, 11, and 12 are taken as examples to be described in detail.Crystal Structure of 1An X-ray study on 1 reveals that it has a 3-D framework, crystallizing in triclinic space group P1\u0305. In the asymmetric unit of [La6(BDC)9(DMF)6(H2O)3\u00b73DMF], there are three different types of coordination numbers: one is seven-coordinated, two are eight-coordinated, and three are nine-coordinated. Six crystallographically different lanthanide ions are shown in Figure 1. La1, La2, and La3 are nine-coordinated with nine oxygen atoms from one chelating carboxylate group, five bridging carboxylate groups, one terminal DMF molecule, and one water molecule (Figure 1). The oxygen atom of the water in La2 is \u03bc2-bridging, which is different from the terminal coordinated water molecule in La1 and La3. Eight oxygen atoms are coordinated with La4 and La6 by six different bridge-linking carboxylate groups, one terminal DMF molecule, and one water molecule. Similar to La1, there exists a bridging oxygen atom and terminal oxygen atom in La4, and La6. La5 is seven-coordinated with six bridge-linking carboxylate groups and one terminal water molecule. The bond lengths of La\u2212O are in the range of 2.438(4)\u22122.968(5) \u00c5, all of which are comparable to those reported for other lanthanide\u2212oxygen donor complexes.(9, 14, 15) In 1, there exist two different metal\u2212carboxylate oxygen chain-shaped building units [La4(CO2)12] (Figure 2). La1 and La3 are linked through four chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate groups to form a metallic dimer (Chart 1a and e); the dimer (La1 and La3) assembles with the other metallic monomers (La5 and La6) through carboxylate groups to lead to discrete metal\u2212carboxylate oxygen chain-shaped building units [La4(CO2)12]. Due to the bridging oxygen atom of water, La2 and its corresponding centrosymmetric atom La2A are connected through four chelating/bridging bidentate carboxylate groups to form a metallic dimer; the dimer (La2 and La2A) assembles with the two metallic monomers (La4 and La4A) through carboxylate groups to construct discrete metal\u2212carboxylate oxygen chain-shaped building units [La4(CO2)12]. The 1-D chains are stitched to each other by the ligands, resulting in an infinite 2-D net with rhomboidal openings and a 3-D La\u2212BDC metal\u2212organic framework (Figures 3 and 4).Chart 1.

Open channels of 1, [010] direction.Figure 4. Polyhedral representation of 1, [001] direction.Crystal Structure of 11The X-ray structure analyses reveal that 11 is isostructural, crystallizing in the cubic crystal system, space group Ia3\u0305. It is constructed from trinuclear Ce3(ADB)3(HADB)3, where there exist two crystallographically different lanthanide atoms (Ce1 and Ce2; Figure 5). The Ce1 atom is 12-coordinated by six chelating carboxylate groups from six HADB anions, forming an icosahedron: Ce1\u2212O1, O1A, O1B, O1C, O1D, O1E = 2.682(2) \u00c5; Ce1\u2212O2, O2A, O2B, O2C, O2D, O2E = 2.765(2) \u00c5. There only exists one coordination mode for the ligand: bidentate and tridentate (Chart 1d). The HADB anions bridge two different coordinated Ce atoms (Ce1, Ce2, or Ce2A) constructing a trinuclear cluster (Figure S4): two oxygen atoms of one carboxylate group (O1 and O2) chelate to Ce1, and one of the two oxygen atoms (O1) bridges Ce1 and Ce2 (Ce1\u2212O2\u2212Ce2A, 99.98(7)\u00b0). There are three oxygen bridges between the Ce1 and Ce2 (Ce2A) atoms with a Ce1\u2212Ce2(Ce2A) distance of 4.04(2) \u00c5. The Ce1, Ce2, and Ce2A atoms are in a line with a Ce2\u2212Ce2A distance of 8.08(2) \u00c5, and the Ce1 atom locates on the symmetric center of the trinuclear unit. The Ce2 is nine-coordinated by nine oxygen atoms (Ce2\u2212O2A or O2B or O2C, 2.509(2) \u00c5; Ce2\u2212O3A or O3B or O3C, 2.549(2); Ce2\u2212O4A or O4B or O4C, 2.542(2) \u00c5) from three ADB carboxylate groups and three HADB anions with a distorted tricapped trigonal prism. The bond lengths of Ce\u2212O are within the range of those usually encountered for lanthanide oxygen coordination.(16a) If considering ADB and HADB as linkers and trinuclear cerium clusters as tricapped trigonal prisms with six nodes, 11 possesses a NaCl-type 3-D network with an open channel system of ca. 1.9 nm space (the distance between the centers of two Ce's; Figures 6 and 7).Figure 5. Coordination environment of CeIII in 11.Figure 6. 3-D open channel system of 11.Figure 7. The NaCl-type topology net of 11.A PLATON program analysis suggests that approximately 35.3% of the crystal volume is accessible to the solvents.(17) When the DMSO and water molecules are removed, the volume increases up to 79.9%, more than that observed in MOF\u2212500 (78.5%).(18) Compared with {[Nd3(ATPT)3(HATPT)3]\u00b79H2O}n (H2ATPT = 2-aminoterephthalic acid), ADB, which is the extending BDC, increases the volume by 28.9%.(19)Crystal Structure of 12Each asymmetric unit [Ce2(ADB)3(H2O)3]n contains two CeIII, three ADB ligands, and three water molecules. Two crystallographically different Ce atoms (Ce1 and Ce2) are shown in Figure 8. Ce1 is coordinated with eight oxygen atoms from three chelating/bridging tridentate carboxylate groups (O1, O7, O8, and O11), four di-monodentate carboxylate groups (O3, O4, O9, and O10), and one terminal water molecule (O15). The nine oxygen atoms are coordinated with Ce2 by three chelating/bridging tridentate carboxylate groups (O1, O2, O7, O11, and O12), two di-monodentate carboxylate groups (O5 and O6), and two terminal water molecules (O13 and O14). The Ce\u2212O(carboxylate) and Ce\u2212O(water) bonds are in the ranges of 2.393(9)\u22122.909(7) and 2.579(9)\u22122.658(8) \u00c5, respectively, all of which are comparable to those reported for other cerium\u2212oxygen donor complexes.(16a) The Ce1 and its corresponding centrosymmetric atom (Ce1A) link through four bridging di-monodentate carboxylate groups of ADB ligands to form a metallic dimer. The dimer (Ce1 and Ce1A) assembles with the two metallic monomers (Ce2 and Ce2A) through chelating/bridging carboxylate groups, leading to discrete metal\u2212carboxylate oxygen chain-shaped building units [Ce4(CO2)12] (Figure 9). These metal\u2212carboxylate oxygen chain-shaped building units through three coordination modes of the ADB linkers (Chart 1a, b, and e) link to each other and construct a 3-D framework with 1.7 nm (the distance between the centers of two Ce's) trigonal channels along the [0,0,1] direction (Figure 10). The intrachain Ce\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce distances are 4.419, 4.118, and 5.202 \u00c5 for Ce1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce1A, Ce1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce2, and Ce2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce1A, respectively.Figure 8. Coordination environment of CeIII in 12.Figure 9. 1-D metal\u2212carboxylic oxygen chain-shaped building units [Ce4(CO2)12]n of 12.Figure 10. Open channels of 12, [001] direction.By comparing with 7, 11, and 12, it is useful to find out how the frameworks are constructed from SBUs. There exist two types of SBUs in metal\u2212organic frameworks reported by Yaghi\u2019s group: short SBUs and infinite chain-like SBUs. The short metal\u2212carboxylate SBUs can be linked by the organic groups as \u201cstruts\u201d, and the infinite chain-like SBUs are joined through organic units as \u201clinkers\u201d to assemble MOFs.(1e)Compounds 7 and 11 have the short SBUs because the dimer [Ln2(CO2)4] and trimer Ce3(ADB)3(HADB)3 are connected to each other through ADB groups as \u201clinkers\u201d. The ADB ligands with carboxylate groups that adopt di-monodentate and chelating/bridging tridentate coordination modes are the \u201clinkers\u201d, and those that adopt the chelating bidentate mode are the \u201cstruts\u201d that connect the dimeric units. However, 12 shows the infinite chain-like SBUs.IR SpectraCompound 1 shows strong bands at 1655 and 1533 cm\u22121 as well as at 1401 cm\u22121, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups, respectively. The bonds at 3060, 1543, 831, 760, and 671 cm\u22121 are attributed to the aromatic skeleton vibration of the benzene ring (Figure S8, Supporting Information).Thermogravimetric Analysis and Powder X-Ray DiffractionTG analysis of 1 displays the first weight loss of 20.1% between 100 and 480 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of eight DMF and one H2O molecule (calculated: 20.0%). Above 480 \u00b0C, the compound starts to decompose. The remaining weight of 32.0% corresponds to the percentage of the La and O component, La2O3 (calculated: 32.3%; Figure S9, Supporting Information). Thermogravimentric analyses for 3 give similar results.The TG analysis of 4 displays the first weight loss of 21.9% between 150 and 480 \u00b0C, corresponding to the loss of DMF and H2O molecules (calculated: 21.4%). Above 500 \u00b0C, the compound starts to decompose. The remaining weight of 28.4% corresponds to the percentage of the Y and O component, Y2O3 (calculated: 26.40%; Figure S9, Supporting Information).The TG analysis of 7 shows a weight loss starting at room temperature and ending at 180 \u00b0C to give a total loss of 58.5%. This is equivalent to the loss of 20 DMSO molecules per formula unit (calcd: 58.2%) and accounting for the liberation of all guests in the channels.The experimental powder XRD patterns for 1 are in good agreement with the corresponding simulated ones (Figure S10, Supporting Information).Photoluminescent PropertiesThe solid-state photoluminescent spectra of 6 were recorded at room temperature (Figure 11). The emission spectrum of 6 exhibits typical emission bands of EuIII ions upon excitation at 350 nm. The emission bands in 6 arise from 5D0\u21927FJ (J = 0\u22124) transitions of EuIII ions.(20) The 5D0\u21927F0 and 5D0\u21927F3 transitions are too weak to be observed. The most intense emission at 616 nm is attributed to the electric dipole induced 5D0\u21927F2 transition, which is hypersensitive to the coordination environment of the EuIII ion.(20) The medium\u2212strong emission at 591 nm is corresponding to the magnetic dipole induced 5D0\u21927F1 transition, which is fairly insensitive to the environment of the EuIII ion. The intensity ratio of 5D0\u22127F2/5D0\u22127F1 is ca. 5.7, indicating that the EuIII ion is not located at the inversion center and the symmetry of the EuIII ion site is low; this is in agreement with the single-crystal structure of 6.Figure 11. Solid state excitation (red) and emission (black) spectra of 6.Magnetic PropertiesVariable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with polycrystalline samples of 3, 6, and 7 at an applied field of 2 kOe in the range of 1.8\u2212300 K. The plots of \u03c7MT vs T are shown in Figure 12. For compound 3, the \u03c7MT value is 1.68 emu K mol\u22121 at room temperature, which is close to the spin-only value of 1.68 emu K mol\u22121 based on NdIII ion with SNd = 8/11 and gNd = 3/2, indicating basic paramagnetic properties in 3. Upon lowering the temperature, \u03c7MT decreases down to 0.4 emu K mol\u22121, indicating strong deviations from the Curie law.(21) This result indicates that these bridging carboxylate groups mediate in total a very weak magnetic exchange interaction between NdIII ions.Figure 12. Temperature dependences of magnetic properties for 3, 6, and 7.For 6, the observed \u03c7MT value is 1.61 emu K mol\u22121 at room temperature, slightly more than the value 1.5 for a EuIII ion calculated by Van Vleck, allowing for population of the excited state with higher values of J at 293 K. As the temperature is lowered, \u03c7MT decreases continuously, which should be attributed to the depopulation of the Stark levels for a single EuIII ion. At the lowest temperature, \u03c7MT is close to zero, indicating a J = 0 ground state of the EuIII ion (7F0).(22)For 7, the \u03c7MT value is 0.548 emu K mol\u22121 at room temperature, which is lower than the spin-only value of 0.804 emu K mol\u22121 based on the CeIII ion, and at 1.8 K, the value is close to the spin-only value of 0.213 emu K mol\u22121, indicating basic paramagnetic properties in 7. This result indicates that the magnetic properties of 3, 6, and 7 are mainly ascribed to the contribution of the spin\u2212orbit coupling of LnIII ions; namely, 3, 6, and 7 display single-ion behaviors, which are the same as the properties reported in the literature previously.(23)Top of PageAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionExperimental SectionReferencesConclusionTwelve 3-D lanthanide porous coordination polymers have been successfully constructed from lanthanide ions and H2BDC or H2ADB under mild conditions. Compounds 1\u22123 form 1-D metal\u2212carboxylate oxygen chain-shaped building units [Ln4(CO2)12]n that generate 1-D open channel systems, with 4 \u00d7 7 \u00c5 rhombic channels. Compounds 4\u22126 possess two-fold interpenetrating structures through lanthanide ions dimers. Compounds 7\u221210 are all 3-D interpenetrating structures and adopt the CaB6-type topology structure. 11 adopts a NaCl-type topological structure with a 3-D open channel system of ca. 1.9 nm space. 12 gives rise to a 3-D framework that consists of 1-D open trigonal channels with a 1-D metal\u2212carboxylate oxygen chain-shaped building unit [Ln4(CO2)12]n. Compound 6 shows a EuIII characteristic red luminescence, which has potential application in optical devices. The magnetic properties of 3, 6, and 7 are mainly ascribed to the contribution of the spin\u2212orbit coupling of LnIII ions and display single-ion behaviors. Further efforts will be focused on investigating the effect of temperature and the even larger porosity of lanthanide porous coordination polymers using lanthanide metal ions and more extended ligands.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionExperimental SectionReferencesExperimental SectionGeneral Materials and CharacterizationThe Ln(NO3)3\u00b76H2O (Ln = Y, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd and Dy) compounds were prepared by dissolving the corresponding Ln2O3 in an aqueous solution of HNO3 (6.0 M) and were evaporated at 100 \u00b0C.

Intensities were collected with graphite monochromatized Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) operating at 50 kV and 30 mA, using the \u03d5 and \u03c9 scan technique. The data reduction was made with the Bruker SAINT package. Absorption corrections were performed using the SADABS program. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F2 by full-matrix least-squares using SHELXL-2000 with anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms.(25) Hydrogen atoms were introduced in calculations using the riding model. The hydrogen thermal displacement parameters were fixed at 1.5 times the equivalent isotropic thermal displacement parameters of the internal and terminal carrier atoms. All computations were carried out using the SHELXTL-2000 program package.(26) The detailed crystallographic data and structural refinement parameters for 1\u22125 and 7\u221212 are summarized in Tables 1\u22124.Table 1.
