The rapid accumulation of CO2, which has mainly caused global warming, is an emerging challenging environmental problem all over the world.(8) MOFs, instead of the traditional zeolites or activated carbon, are the most promising materials for CO2 capture because their pore characteristics can be modified with functional groups (\u2212NH2, \u2212NO2, \u2212OH, and \u2212SO3H groups and triazine nitrogen atoms) to immobilize into channels, and this has been demonstrated to be beneficial to enhance CO2 adsorption.(8, 9)Multiple carboxylate ligands have been widely used as bridging ligands for building MOFs because of their versatile coordination modes as well as their ability to act as H-bond acceptors and donors to assemble supramolecular structures.(9) However, to the best of our knowledge, multicarboxylic acid ligands based on quinoxaline have not yet been explored as the organic linkers. Here, we synthesized the dicarboxylic ligand H2DDQ (=N,N\u2032-dibenzoic acid-2,3-diaminoquinoxaline) having the following advantages: (1) the distance between the two carboxyl groups is about 15 \u00c5, which enhances the ability to construct porous frameworks, (2) quinoxaline, which connects the two carboxylate groups, can act as a large hindrance group that prevents the formation of interpenetration and self-interpenetration and furthermore it can also reduce the size of the channels while inducing reasonable pore canals,(10) and (3) pairs of active N\u2013H groups and pyrazine nitrogen atoms in the ligands can increase CO2 adsorptions effectively. In this work, we present and discuss three MOFs with H2DDQ for CO2 and dye adsorptions, fluorescence, and catalysis of cyanosilylation reactions.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionReferencesExperimental SectionMaterials and Physical MeasurementsAll of the starting materials employed were purchased from commercial sources and used as received without further purification.

The crystal structures were solved by direct methods using difference Fourier synthesis with SHELXTS(11) and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods using the SHELXL-97 program.(12) The non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms, except for those of guest molecules, were added according to theoretical models. The solvent molecules in the structures were highly disordered, were impossible to find in the Fourier maps, and were fixed in the ideal position.(13) To resolve this issue, the contribution of solvent electron density was removed by the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON.(14) The lattice water and DMF molecules were determined with elemental analysis and TG data. Crystal data and details of the structure determination for these three compounds are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information).Gas Adsorption ExperimentsPrior to the gas adsorption experiments, the samples were soaked in methanol to exchange the H2O and DMF solvents, which was then followed by evacuation under a dynamic vacuum at 120 \u00b0C for 8 h to remove all guest molecules. The nitrogen gas adsorption isotherm was monitored at 77 K at each equilibrium pressure by the static volumetric method on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 HD88 analyzer. CO2 adsorption isotherms were obtained with at 273 K by a similar procedure.Dye Adsorption ExperimentsThe compound (10 mg) was added to a 3 mL of a ca. 500 mg/L dye-containing water solution with stirring at room temperature. The solution was centrifuged, and the clear liquid was analyzed by UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy. Fast separate experiments were carried out with 6 mL dye mixtures by adding two 10 mg/L dyes in 1/2 h.Catalytic Test for Aldehyde and Ketone Cyanosilylation ReactionIn a 10 mL screw-cap vial, aldehyde (1.0 mmol) and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN, 2 mmol) were placed successively and the desolvated compound (2.5 mol %) was then added to initiate the reaction with ultrasound for 1 h in the sealed vial. For the less reactive ketone cyanosilylation reaction, the reaction time was extended to 3 h with the same ratio of reactants. After the reaction was completed, the catalyst was removed by centrifugation and then filtered quickly with ethyl acetate. The conversions of aldehydes and ketones were determined by gas chromatographic analysis (GC, Agilent 7890A) and comparison of GC-MS (HP 6890) spectra with those of authentic samples.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionReferencesResults and DiscussionSynthetic and Spectral AspectsStructure DescriptionAs shown in Figure 1a, in the structure of Pb-DDQ, Pb ions have triangular-prismatic coordination geometries with one oxygen atom from one H2O molecule and five carboxylate oxygen atoms from the DDQ2\u2013 ligands. Pb\u2013O bond lengths are in the 2.359(4)\u20132.742(4) \u00c5 range, which are comparable to the Pb\u2013O bond lengths reported.(15) As we know, the Pb\u2013Pb bond distance is about 2.88 \u00c5.(16) However, the Pb\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Pb distances in the structure are 4.05 and 4.99 \u00c5 (Figure 1b), which do not indicate any significant direct interactions between the Pb atoms but indicate constraint by the bridging geometry of carboxylate groups. The DDQ2\u2013 anions bridge the Pb ions in \u03bc2-\u03b71:\u03b71 and \u03bc2-\u03b72:\u03b71 coordination modes to generate a 2D ladderlike layer (Figure 1c). Two strong C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 stacking interactions are found in the structure (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7centroid distances 2.66 and 2.95 \u00c5) between C12\u2013H12 and Cg2 as well as C12\u2013H12 and Cg1 (Cg1i = C(1)\u2013C(6) (i = x, \u22121 + y, z); Cg2ii = N1, N2, C5\u2013C8 (ii = 1/2 \u2013 x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 \u2013 z)). The adjacent 2D ladderlike layers are interlinked via those strong C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 stacking interactions to form a 3D supramolecular framework with square windows of 8.76 \u00c5 \u00d7 13.18 \u00c5 (atom to atom distances) along the b axis (Figure 1d). The solvent-accessible volume is 556.5 \u00c53 per unit cell, which is 23.1% of the total crystal volume by excluding the guest H2O and DMF molecules calculated by PLATON.Figure 1. (a) Coordination environment of Pb-DDQ. (b) View of the Pb\u2013Pb bond distances. (c) The 2D ladderlike layer of Pb-DDQ. (d) Packing diagram of Pb-DDQ, showing the 1D square channels along the b axis.For Zn-DDQ, the asymmetric unit consists of one Zn ion, one H2DDQ ligand, and two coordinated H2O molecules. The central ZnII ion is five-coordinated to form a slightly disordered rectangular pyramid with two N atoms from the chelating N\u2013H group (Zn\u2013N = 2.083(11) and 2.093(11) \u00c5) and three O atoms from one carboxylate group with the \u03b71 mode and two H2O molecules (Zn\u2013O = 2.020(8)\u20132.083(10) \u00c5). Only one of the carboxylates of the ligand is connected to the central Zn ions; the other is deprotonated to balance the charge and linked to the nearest coordinated H2O by a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction with an O2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O5 distance of 2.736 \u00c5. The DDQ2\u2013 ligand here acts as an unpredictable bridging mode which connects the Zn ions into a 1D chain from the a axis with a Zn\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Zn distance of 9.536 \u00c5 (Figure 2a). The 1D chains are further connected to the 2D layer via strong face-to-face \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 stacking interactions between the adjacent quinoxaline rings with a centroid to centroid distance of 3.426 \u00c5 (Figure 2b). After the solvated molecules are removed, there is 34.7% void space in the total crystal volume (total potential solvent area volume 965.8 \u00c53 per unit cell volume 2781.1 \u00c53). From Figure 2c, the 3D porous frameworks show special divergence-like pores (15.6 \u00c5 \u00d7 10.8 \u00c5) which have been rarely reported to our knowledge from the c axis.Figure 2. (a) The 1D chain of Zn-DDQ. (b) \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions between the 1D chains. (c) Packing diagram of Zn-DDQ, showing the 1D divergence-like channels along the b axis.There are two Cu atoms with different coordination modes in the structure of Cu-DDQ. Cu1 is six-coordinated by two N atoms from the chelating N\u2013H group and four O atoms from two different DDQ2\u2013 molecules in the bridging bidentate mode, forming a distorted-octahedral geometry. With the bridging mode of the DDQ2\u2013 ligand, the Cu1 atoms are connected to form 1D chains from the c axis with a Cu1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu1 distance of 8.95 \u00c5 (Figure 3a). For Cu2, which is five-coordinated, two carboxylate oxygen atoms from two adjacent DDQ2\u2013 molecules occupy its apical positions, and three coordinated H2O molecules are in the equatorial plane with Cu\u2013O bond lengths in the range 1.985(12)\u20132.338(11) \u00c5. Cu2 atoms in the structures act as bridging atoms which connect the 1D chain into 2D layers to afford a 2D undulant network with a 4-connected (44\u00b762) kg m net topology (Figure 3b). Then these adjacent 2D layers are further interconnected by \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 stacking interactions between the quinoxaline rings to form the 3D open framework (Figure 3c). Meanwhile, the 1D cuboid-shaped channel can be viewed along the c axis with ca. 15.27 \u00c5 \u00d7 9.34 \u00c5 windows (Figure 4). The total potential solvent accessible void volume was calculated to be 963.1 \u00c53 per cell, 33.5% of the crystal volume.Figure 3. (a) The 1D chain of Cu-DDQ. (b) The 2D layer of Cu-DDQ. (c) \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions between the 1D chains.Figure 4. Packing diagram of Cu-DDQ, showing the 1D cuboid-shaped channel along the a axis.On the basis of the substantive weight loss from the TGA analyses (Figure S2, Supporting Information), there should be organic solvents such as DMF and H2O inside the MOF channels. The phase purities of the three MOFs have been confirmed by PXRD (Figure S1, Supporting Information). To evaluate the storage capability of the three desolvated MOFs, nitrogen and CO2 adsorption studies were conducted. The three N2 adsorption isotherms reveal type I behavior (Figure 5). The N2 adsorptions of three MOF materials are very low at 77 K, as are the calculated accessible surface areas, which is probably due to the distorted framework upon removal of the solvent molecules.(17) Adsorption measurements of CO2 were carried out up to about 800 Torr at 273 K (Figure 6). Interestingly, though only a small N2 loading, the CO2 uptake of Cu-DDQ is considerably high. Cu-DDQ can uptake nearly 26.1 wt % (180 cm3/g STP) of CO2 at 800 Torr and 273 K. In comparison to the numerous MOFs reported with higher accessible porosity, only a few MOFs display a CO2 adsorption to such a value.(5a) The CO2 uptake of Zn-DDQ is also very high at 12.8 wt % (75 cm3/g STP) of CO2 at 800 Torr and 273 K. Indeed, the void volumes of these two MOFs are less than 35%. These values are better than those of MOF-5 and MOF-177, which have greater Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller surface area.(4c) The observed enhancement in CO2 adsorptions is mostly attributed to the N\u2013H groups on pyrazine decorating the channels. As is well known, N\u2013H groups here can be considered not only as a kind of basic group but also as hydrogen-bond donors which can catch the CO2 molecules with hydrogen-bonding interactions. Moreover, in light of such high CO2 and low N2 uptake, Cu-DDQ can be used as an efficient material for CO2 and N2 selectivity.(18)Figure 5. N2 adsorption isotherms for the three MOFs at 77 K.Figure 6. CO2 adsorption isotherms for Cu-DDQ and Zn-DDQ at 273 K.The removal of dyes from contaminated water is very important due to the fact that they are highly visible, toxic, and even carcinogenic for people.(19) Recently, liquid adsorption and separation for the removal of dyes from aqueous solutions in MOFs have received increasing attention. Herein we adopted four harmful dyes (Rhodamine B (RhB), methyl blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), and crystal violet (CV)) in water solution to employ the dye adsorption and separation of the three water-stable MOFs as adsorbents. The dye-loading abilities were measured by UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy (Figures S4\u2013S6, Supporting Information). The adsorbed quantities of the four dyes over Zn-DDQ are shown in Figure 7. The MB adsorption is the fastest in comparison to the other three. The largest amount of MB can be taken up to nearly 150 mg g\u20131 in less than 1/2 h due to the suitable size of MB for absorption in the divergence-like gate. With its smaller molecular size, MO can easily pass though the channels and not stay fixed. However, the lower adsorptions of RhB and CV are caused by their larger molecular structures, which have little ability to pass through the divergence-like gate. Interestingly, the CV adsorption is much better in Cu-DDQ in comparison to the other three dyes. Similar to the MB adsorption of Zn-DDQ, CV adsorption also proceeded particularly quickly and reached the highest adsorption amount of 135 mg g\u20131 in 1/2 h (Figure 8). In consideration of the special adsorption characteristics, we found materials which can separate the dye mixtures in a short time. To confirm our speculation, Zn-DDQ and Cu-DDQ were used to separate the dye mixtures with equal amounts of MB/RhB, MB/MO, MB/CV and CV/RhB, CV/MB, CV/MO mixtures in 1/2 h (Figure 9). The results indicate clearly that Zn-DDQ and Cu-DDQ are fast separation materials. The dye-loading abilities of Pb-DDQ have also been studied (Figure 10). The adsorption amounts of RhB and MB are 79(4) and 86(1) mg g\u20131, respectively. However, due to the molecular size of MO and CV, the adsorption capacity for these two dyes is not as good as that for RhB and MB. Indeed, because of its lower porosity, Pb-DDQ has a poorer ability than the two MOFs above.Figure 7. Effects of contact time on the four dye adsorptions over Zn-DDQ: RhB (red); MB (blue); MO (orange); CV (violet).Figure 8.

UV\u2013vis absorption spectra of the separation of MB/other and CV/other mixtures in 1/2 h with Zn-DDQ and Cu-DDQ, respectively.Figure 10. Effects of contact time on the four dye adsorptions over Pb-DDQ: RhB (red); MB (blue); MO (orange); CV (violet).The photoluminescent properties of the H2DDQ ligand and Pb-DDQ, Zn-DDQ, and Cu-DDQ have also been investigated in the solid state at room temperature (Figure 11). H2DDQ exhibits a broad emission band at 509 nm, which can be ascribed to the intraligand \u03c0 to \u03c0* transition. Interestingly, in comparison to the band of H2DDQ, the three compounds have a red shift of 39 nm and are all blue luminescent emitters with an emission maximum at about 472 nm. These emissions could be assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT).(20) Zn-DDQ shows stronger emission than Pb-DDQ and Cu-DDQ because the Zn ions have a d10 electronic configuration.Figure 11. Solid-state emission spectra of H2DDQ and the three MOFs.As we know, cyanosilylation reactions are widely used to test the Lewis acid catalysis of MOFs.(21) The three MOFs have been tested as heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysts for the cyanosilylation of benzaldehydes and ketones (Scheme 1). Cyanosilylation catalyses without solvent have been proven to have higher catalytic activity.(22) First, the materials were tested with benzaldehyde as the standard molecule. The results are summarized in Table 1. With Cu-DDQ, a higher conversion of 95(0.9)% of benzaldehyde is reached in 1 h reaction time. However, Pb-DDQ and Zn-DDQ can only catalyze benzaldehyde with conversions of 38(0.6)% and 56(1.1)%, respectively. The lower catalytic activities suggest that the Lewis acidity of the Cu-DDQ compound is higher than that of Pb-DDQ and Zn-DDQ. As a result, Cu-DDQ was selected as the superior catalyst to catalyze the other substrates. Due to the existence of the electron-withdrawing chloride ion, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde can be completely converted in 1 h in this nucleophilic reaction. However, the conversions of cyanosilylation of ketones are not as good as those of the benzaldehydes. All of the ketones selected can be catalyzed in yields of less than 40%, which are due to the weak activities of the ketones in this reaction. The heterogeneity of the reaction was confirmed by a filtration test (Table S3, Supporting Information). To demonstrate their recyclability, successive reactions were carried out for the cyanosilylation of benzaldehyde, showing that the recovered catalyst can be reused without appreciable loss after at least four cycles (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Moreover, as we know, Cu-MOFs with cyanosilylation catalysis properties have been rarely reported,(23) and Cu-DDQ is the Cu-MOF possessing the best catalytic activity for benzaldehydes. The observed catalytic activities show that Cu-DDQ is a potential catalyst for cyanosilylation.(21)Scheme 1. Cyanosilylation Reaction in the Presence of Three MOFsTable 1.

Zn-DDQ and Cu-DDQ can uptake a greater amount of CO2 due to their porosity and N\u2013H functionalized groups. Cu-DDQ also exhibits high and selective CO2 and N2 uptake. The three MOFs have adsorption capacities of selected dyes to various degrees. Zn-DDQ and Cu-DDQ are promising materials for the fast separation of MB/other and CV/other mixtures, respectively. Cu-DDQ catalyzes aldehydes with higher yields and TOFs, indicating its higher Lewis acidity.
