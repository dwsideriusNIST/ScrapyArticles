Apart from being an ozone-friendly substitute, such a system has a remarkable edge as it is driven by heat sources that are considered low (below 373.15 K). This allows for recovered waste heat to be useful by simply circulating water as both heater and coolant. Such chillers which are easily incorporated into existing plant designs appear to have no environmental impediment on its usage in the next decade. The coefficient of performance, however, of the adsorption chiller is relatively low since it operates with low grade heat.(1, 2, 15-17, 19-25)A primary factor in selecting suitable adsorbent\u2013adsorbate pairs for an AD cycle is the working pair\u2019s adsorption equilibria and isosteric enthalpy of adsorption characteristics. Extensive work has already been conducted experimentally to study the efficacy of adsorption cooling systems using assorted combinations of adsorbent/adsorbate pairs.(3-11, 26)This article reports on the experimental adsorption isotherm data for samples of several refrigerants on activated carbon as part of the ongoing effort toward generating the experimental adsorption equilibria data for combinations of specific adsorbent/adsorbate pairs. These refrigerants are R134a, R290, R410a, and R507a. The activated carbon specimens tested are Maxsorb III and ACF-A20 at temperatures ranging from 293 K to 358 K. The adsorption uptakes are calculated using the constant-volume\u2013variable-pressure (CVVP) approach and the adsorption characteristics of Dubinin\u2013Ashtakov (DA) are then regressed from the experimental isotherms. Further, the concentration- and temperature-dependent enthalpies of adsorption are evaluated.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsDiscussionConclusionsReferencesExperimental SectionMaterialsIn these experiments, high-purity grade samples of R134a, R410a, R290, and R507a are used, and their properties are evaluated using the Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties Database of NIST (REFPROP). The purity of these gases and their sources are furnished in Table 1. The activated carbons, Maxsorb III (by Kansai Coke Company, Japan) and ACF-A20 (by Unitika Co. Ltd., Japan), were chosen to determine the adsorption characteristics of R134a, R290, R410a, and R507a. The first specimen is in powder form, while the latter is fibrous form. The detailed porous characteristics of both ACF-A20 and Maxsorb III samples including its Brunauer\u2013Emmet\u2013Teller surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter are furnished in Table 2.

The volumes of the adsorption and charging cells are calibrated by using a calibrated standard volume (210.9 mL with an uncertainty of 0.2 mL) using helium gas. These volumes are determined by measuring the pressures of the combined volumes at isothermal conditions. Either 5.80 g of Maxsorb III or 5.11 g of ACF-A20 were loaded into the adsorption cell with packing density ranging from 0.1 g\u00b7cm\u20133 to 0.12 g\u00b7cm\u20133. The charging cell is connected to the adsorption cell through 1/4\u2033 nominal plumbing comprising of stainless steel Swagelok tubing, ball valves, and fittings. Both cells were submerged in a water bath whose temperature is approximated to be uniform throughout. It may be assumed that no temperature gradient would occur within the cells since adequate time is allowed for thermal stabilization and water is circulated continuously by the constant temperature circulator. The schematic diagram of the setup is depicted in Figure 3. The liquid circulator (HAAKE F8-C35) is used to control the preselected temperature via the Thermo Haake FuzzyStar fuzzy logic control. The constant-temperature unit operates between 278.15 K and 368.15 K with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.01 K. The temperatures within the adsorption and charging cells are recorded using 1/3 DIN Pt 100 \u03a9 RTDs which has an estimated uncertainty of \u00b1 0.15 K. The RTD in the adsorption cell is in direct contact with the adsorbent sample for accurate temperature measurement of the activated carbon. This temperature reading is used as the isotherm temperature. The pressure readings are read by a 0 MPa to 5 MPa range KYOWA pressure transducer (PGS-50KA). This unit has an uncertainty of 0.1 % of the rated full scale. All of the pressure and temperature readings are recorded by a data logger (Agilent) at 10 s intervals over the entire experiment. A heater tape which is controlled by a thermostat is attached on the capillary tubing to prevent condensation.Figure 3. Schematic arrangement of experimental setup.Before the experiments, the whole setup is evacuated to an ultimate pressure of 0.005 kPa by a BOC Edwards direct drive vane vacuum pump. During the evacuation, the adsorption cell is maintained over 393.15 K to desorb any residual gas in the cell but below 408.15 K to avoid charring of the adsorbent sample. Helium gas is introduced into the system at regular intervals and then vacuumed out to improve the residual gas removal process. After 24 h of evacuation while keeping valve 2 closed, refrigerant gas is injected into the charging cell from the gas cylinder. After sufficient time for stabilization, ball valve 2 is then opened to allow the gas to be released into the adsorption cell. When the pressure of the gas remains constant within the instrumental error, the pressure and temperature are recorded. Both of these measurements are crucial in calculating the mass of gas adsorbed. Subsequently, the experiment is repeated with the bath maintained at temperatures ranging from 278.15 to 348.15 K and the charging cell charged to various pressures below the refrigerant\u2019s saturation pressure. These pressures are 0.7 MPa, 0.8 MPa, 1.4 MPa, and 1.1 MPa for refrigerants R134a, R290, R410, and R507a, respectively, to prevent condensation of the refrigerant in the tubing and the associated errors in calculating the mass of refrigerant.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsDiscussionConclusionsReferencesResultsData ReductionThe isotherm parameters of the adsorption system are generated by determining the mass of adsorbed gas when the system reaches its equilibrium state. For a fixed volume system, this mass is determined from the system pressure and temperature before and after the adsorption process. When the charging cell is charged to a known pressure at the initial stage of the experiment, the mass of the adsorbate in the cell at the respective states are calculated from eq 1.(1)where \u03c1ab_i is the density of the refrigerant at initial charging temperature, Tcharging. Vcharging_cell is the volume of the charging cell.In the current study, it is assumed that adsorption occurs at the micropores of the adsorbent. The volume of the void space Vvoid of the adsorption cell is calculated as:(2)In eq 2, the volume of the adsorption cell Vad_cell, mass and density of the activated carbon mac and \u03c1solid, as well as the micropore volume of the activated carbon \u03bd\u03bc are known. The mass of refrigerant vapor in the void volume of the adsorption cell is thus calculated as:(3)where \u03c1ab is the density of the refrigerant gas. The mass of leftover refrigerant is calculated from:(4)where Vtotal = Vcharging_cell + Vvoid and Vcharging_cell is the volume of the charging cell. \u03c1ab_f is the density of the adsorbate at that temperature, Tads.The mass of refrigerant adsorbed, mads, is then calculated from(5)which depends on three parameters, namely, pressure, temperature, and the mass of gas adsorbed (in kg) per kg of adsorbent in the adsorption cell. This is termed as the specific uptake q, which is expressed as:(6)The overall uncertainty in specific uptake, q, calculated is not more than \u00b1 5 %. This comprises of uncertainties related to the temperature and pressure readings, the calibrated volume of the cells, values taken from the REFPROP software, and the volume of the capillary.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsDiscussionConclusionsReferencesDiscussionAdsorption Isotherm CorrelationExperimental data of the R134a, R290, R410a, and R507a gas on activated carbon are fitted to the Dubinin\u2013Astakhov (DA) isotherm equation which is represented by eq 7.(13) In this work, this single component isotherm model is assumed without the competitive adsorption adjustment to represent the mixtures R410a and R507a adsorbates. As it can be seen later, this model satisfactorily represents the experimental data.(7)where q is the specific uptake (kg\u00b7kg\u20131), while P and Ps represent the equilibrium and saturation pressures, respectively. The numerical values of qo which is the limiting uptake, E, the characteristic adsorption energy, and n which is an exponent representing structural heterogeneity are regressed from the isotherm data.Figure 4 shows the typical temperature and pressure profiles in the adsorption cell during the commencement of the adsorption process. The temperature rise of the activated carbon sample during the adsorption process is due to the release of the enthalpy of adsorption in the adsorption cell. This happens during the adsorption process represented by the dotted circular mark and is caused by closing the valve connecting the adsorption cell to the charging cell. Both temperatures and pressures are stabilized as the adsorption cell approaches equilibrium. These readings are logged every 10 s. The mass of the adsorbed refrigerant is calculated from the mass of gaseous refrigerant at equilibrium from that which have transferred to the adsorption cell.Figure 4. Typical pressure P and temperature T profiles during adsorption in adsorption chamber: pressure (- - -) and temperature (\u2014).The isotherm data for Maxsorb III\u2013R134a at 293.15 K are compared with a previous study(11, 12) in Figure 5. The adsorption isotherm curves of R134a on both Maxsorb II and Maxsorb III as observed belong to the IUPAC classification Type 1. This is mainly due to their microporous characteristic where its pore size is not very much greater than the adsorbate molecular diameter. Further, the distribution of the specific uptake is attributed to the heterogeneity in the particle pore distribution and surface areas of the adsorbent.Figure 5. Comparison of isotherm data for Maxsorb III activated carbon (\u2212\u25ca\u2212) and Maxsorb II activated carbon (- - \u25a1 - -) with R134a at 293.15 K.The DA isotherm models without adsorbed phase volume correction (eq 7) are superimposed onto the measured isotherm points to predict the adsorption isotherm uptake with overall regression deviations within approximately 5 % of experimental data including R410a and R507a mixtures. The adsorption uptake deviations between the predicted and the experimental uptake are compared as shown in Figures 6 to 9 while the fitted DA equations are depicted in Figures 10 to 15.Figure 6.

Here, it may be observed that the refrigerant R134a has the lowest system pressure and yet gives the highest uptake capacity compared to R290, R410a, and R507a. The optimum uptake of Maxsorb III\u2013R134a is 2.22 kg\u00b7kg\u20131. This is followed by Maxsorb III\u2013R410a, Maxsorb III\u2013R507a, ACF A20\u2013R134a, ACF A20\u2013R507a, and Maxsorb III\u2013R290 at 2.07 kg\u00b7kg\u20131, 2.05 kg\u00b7kg\u20131, 1.29 kg\u00b7kg\u20131, 1.19 kg\u00b7kg\u20131, and 0.90 kg\u00b7kg\u20131, respectively. For the same adsorbate (refrigerant), the ACF A20 has a lower uptake capacity compared to Maxsorb III, due to its lower porosity.Table 3.

The second term indicates the behavior of the adsorbed phase as a function of both the temperature and pressure as these changes during the adsorption process. This is attributed to the nonideality behavior of the gas. \u03bdg in eq 9 is the specific volume of the gas, while dP/dT denotes its pressure gradient with respect to the temperature.The sorption isosteric enthalpy for the respective adsorbent\u2013adsorbate pairs with respect to the specific uptake and various temperatures are shown in Figures 16 to 21. One can observe from these figures that, as the specific uptake increases, Qst decreases. In general, the refrigerant gas molecules are first rapidly adsorbed unto high energy sites of the adsorbent. As the adsorption uptake process continues, these gas molecules proceed to be adsorbed unto lower energy sites. The adsorbate molecules thus initially enter into the smaller micropore sites where the affinity between the adsorbent and the adsorbate gas molecules are stronger. This results in higher Qst values at lower specific uptakes. After the narrower pores are completely filled, the adsorbate gas molecules take up the bigger pore sites in which the adsorption interaction is lower in magnitude. It is thus observed that, as the surface loading increases, the Qst value continues to decrease.Figure 16. Isosteric enthalpy of adsorption for Maxsorb III\u2013R134a.Figure 17. Isosteric enthalpy of adsorption for Maxsorb III\u2013R290.Figure 18. Isosteric enthalpy of adsorption for Maxsorb III\u2013R410a.Figure 19. Isosteric enthalpy of adsorption for Maxsorb III\u2013R507a.Figure 20. Isosteric enthalpy of adsorption for ACF A20\u2013R134a.Figure 21. Isosteric enthalpy of adsorption for ACF A20\u2013R507a.During an adsorbate uptake, the nonideality behavior of the gaseous phase of the refrigerant contributes to about 7 % to 15 % of the total sorption isosteric enthalpy which ranges between 100 kJ\u00b7kg\u20131 to 1400 kJ\u00b7kg\u20131. This depends on the refrigerant\u2013adsorbent pair as well as the loading or uptake.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsDiscussionConclusionsReferencesConclusionsIn the present study, experimental equilibria data were presented for the activated carbon Maxsorb III/ACF A20 adsorbing assorted refrigerants, namely, R134a, R290, R410a, and R507a. The adsorption parameters of these isotherms using the Dubinin\u2013Ashtakov equation are also described. It is observed that qo, as expected for a given adsorbent, increases with the density of refrigerant since it is related to the total volume of the micropores. n is related to dispersion of the pores and remains constant for a given adsorbent (1.29 to 1.36 for Maxsorb III and 1.45 to 1.29 for ACF-A20). From these adsorption data, the sorption isosteric enthalpy was calculated as well. These isotherm data, together with the sorption isosteric enthalpy of the specific refrigerant\u2013adsorbent system is related to the adsorption characteristics of the specimen utilized. This is crucial in the analysis and design of an adsorption system because the isotherm characteristics are rarely possible to extrapolate from one adsorbent\u2013adsorbate pair to another.The authors declare no competing financial interest.Reference QuickViewTop of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResultsDiscussionConclusionsReferencesReferencesThis article references 26 other publications.1.
