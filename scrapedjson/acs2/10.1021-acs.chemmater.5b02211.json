Particularly for the regeneration process, significant energy is required to deliver heat or vacuum as used in processes such as pressure or vacuum swing adsorption.(1, 2) Light is an attractive solution as it is a naturally occurring trigger and independent from the power station production capacity.(3) Light responsive groups, which have been partially or fully incorporated into MOFs, have previously been exploited to trigger the capture and release of CO2.(4, 5) Therefore, capture materials that can be regenerated using light are attractive as they utilize an energy source that is not parasitic to the power plant.(3-11) Light responsive metal organic frameworks (MOFs) combine high capture capacity with structural versatility to offer the potential of triggered release of adsorbed CO2 at high capacities.(3-5, 8, 11) When light responsive groups are introduced within the pores of the MOF or within the framework, photoresponse can be induced or sometimes inhibited.(12) Recently, we showed that this can be achieved with concentrated sunlight to deliver the release of around 70% of adsorbed molecules in a few minutes.(11) Although the results are promising, the use of UV light limits the applicability in particular because of the inherently low penetration depth of this form of radiation. Any application would necessarily require only thin layers of the adsorbent, drastically reducing the volumetric performance. As a result, new chemistry utilizing more penetrating wavelengths is crucial.(13)Photoresponsive MOFs are mainly derived from azobenzene derivatives that respond to UV and visible light to obtain the active and native states, respectively.(4, 5, 8) However, a recent study showed that diarylethene derived MOFs also displayed UV and visible light response to convert between the closed and open phenyl ring state, respectively.(14)Another approach is to adsorb visible light responsive molecules on the external surface of the adsorbent. Among the well-known azobenzene derivatives, o-methyl red (MR), also known as Acid Red, is able to undergo conformational changes from the native trans state to the cis state upon visible light irradiation shorter than 590 nm.(15-17) The relaxation back to the trans state can be achieved in the dark.(15, 16) Thus, MR has attractive properties for introducing visible light response in MOFs. To our knowledge, no MOFs developed for carbon capture has ever showed response exclusively in the visible light region.The rigid Mg-MOF-74 is highly attractive for gas separation as it exhibits high CO2 adsorption capacity under atmospheric conditions and is considered as one of the more promising candidates for CO2 capture due to its high concentration of open metal sites.(18-22)In addition to high gas uptake, the flexible MIL-53(Al) is highly attractive due to its structural stability upon exposure to moisture, one of the many criteria required for gas storage and separations in industrial applications.(23-29) MIL-53(Al) displays reversible structural changes between open and closed pore structures, due to the framework interaction with guest molecules, or from specific pressure or temperature effects.(29-33) Unlike rigid frameworks, structural flexibilities may allow greater structural transformations due to photoresponse.In this study, we demonstrate visible light responsive MR guest molecules on rigid and flexible MOFs, such as Mg-MOF-74 and MIL-53(Al), can exhibit reversible CO2 capture without the use of UV irradiation. It is reported that the MOFs behave in the reverse fashion to previously reported triggered release.(11) These MOFs were exposed under different photoswitching conditions: dynamic and static. This is where light is repeatedly turned on and off throughout adsorption measurements and when sample irradiation takes place prior to each measurement, respectively. We demonstrated that the photoisomerization of MR coated on the MOF surface is responsible for the unique CO2 capture phenomenon (see Figure 1).Figure 1. Visible light-triggered activation of MOFs is a new route to controlling access to the pores.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesResults and DiscussionTo prepare the MOF@MR samples, MR guest molecules were loaded onto the MOF. The term loading refers to the addition of MR to the MOF in DCM, in which the mixture was sonicated for about 15 min. The MR loading concentrations were determined by the weight of MOF and MR in the mixture. The mixture was then filtered and washed thoroughly with DCM. Enhanced CO2 adsorption was observed in both MOF@MR samples upon visible light irradiation, despite the expected reduction in their initial uptake capacities from the introduction of MR (Figure 2). In a nonirradiated state, the presence of MR potentially inhibited CO2 from accessing the pores as saturation was reached at an absolute pressure of 0.7 bar.(34, 35) Interestingly, Mg-MOF-74@MR displayed a light responsive pore-opening effect, in which the total CO2 uptake capacity gradually increased with irradiation time (Figure 2a-b). Most likely, photoirradiation resulted in the pore-opening of the MOF so that the CO2 adsorption sites were progressively unblocked. Under dynamic photoswitching, that is, admitting and excluding light to the sample during gas adsorption analysis, significant CO2 adsorption and release was not observed (Figure 2a) but pore-opening was observed after 30 min of irradiation, increasing the total CO2 uptake by 35% (17 cm3/g STP) (Figure 2a). This pore-opening effect was also observed within 30 min of static irradiation\u2013exposing the sample to light prior to gas adsorption analyses - delivering a 50% adsorption capacity increase (8 cm3/g STP) (Figure 2b). The total uptake increase was significantly enhanced by 84% when the sample was further statically irradiated for 60 min, which delivered the maximum CO2 adsorption change. The pore-opening effect was much more pronounced under static conditions. Previously, it was demonstrated that dynamic photoswitching exhibited lower gas uptake capacity compared to that static photoswitching.(11) The gated system offered an advantageous process, like a dynamic photoswitching system, where the amount of CO2 adsorbed could be tuned depending on the light irradiation time, providing a controlled and selective route. The pore-opening effect was found to be reversible as Mg-MOF-74@MR relaxed back to the initial state overnight in the dark (Figure 3). However, a gradual decrease in overall performance of a nonirradiated Mg-MOF-74@MR was observed with each overnight relaxation cycle. An earlier saturation point (0.5 bar) was observed, and the maximum CO2 uptake capacities at the saturation point reduced by 36% after one cycle, followed by a further reduction of 19% in the next cycle (Figure 3). Although previous reports have shown that Mg-MOF-74 displayed a loss in uptake capacity in consecutive cycles,(36) the relaxation of MR in Mg-MOF-74@MR may have gradually degraded the MOF.Visible light irradiation of MIL-53(Al)@MR displayed a similar pore-opening effect, where significant increase in CO2 uptake was observed upon visible light irradiation. However, a saturation point was not observed. Perhaps, this could be due to the flexibility of the MIL framework accommodating more CO2.(34, 37-39, 50) It has been shown in the literature that similar gas adsorption behavior with saturation points can be observed in other nonflexible MOFs.(34) Due to its flexibility, the effect of different MR loading concentrations (15 and 50 wt %) was investigated. The results revealed that although total uptake capacities in the nonirradiated state reduced at higher MR loading concentrations, a stronger photoresponse was obtained. Under static conditions, the CO2 uptake capacity of irradiated MIL-53(Al)@MR at 15 wt % was increased by 9% (27 cm3/g STP) (Figure 2d). This trend was more pronounced at 50 wt % guest loading where uptake was significantly increased by 46% (14 cm3/g STP) (Figure 2e). Larger adsorption changes were obtained in a higher guest loading level (Figure 2c). However, a peak was observed at lower guest loading concentration at 0.3 bar. As discussed above, the pore opening effect may be due to the movement of MR, from trans to the more compact cis form, on the MOF surface when irradiated. Thus, the pore opening effect is more enhanced with more MR loading. The term MOF surface refers to the external surface of the MOF crystals. At lower guest loading concentration, the environment would be less constricted and hence a sudden increase in photoresponse at the beginning of an adsorption measurement (Figure 2c). Similar to Mg-MOF-74@MR, dynamic photoswitching of MIL-53(Al)@MR resulted in a lower total CO2 uptake than that obtained under static conditions. Furthermore, degradation may have occurred after relaxation as lower gas adsorption performance of a nonirradiated sample was also observed. Control studies were undertaken to ensure that the pore opening effect was purely due to the presence of MR with the MOFs during gas adsorption. In the absence of MR, irradiation of Mg-MOF-74 and MIL-53(Al) showed very low photoresponse compared to their corresponding MOF@MRs as 12% and 0.6% reduction in uptake capacity was obtained respectively (Figure SI-15a-b). This could be attributed to the aromatic nature of the MOF, particularly in Mg-MOF-74 where the framework itself absorbs visible light (Figure SI-2).Figure 2. CO2 adsorption isotherms of nonirradiated and irradiated Mg-MOF-74@MR (a,b) and MIL-53(Al)@MR 15 wt % (d) and 50 wt % (e) under dynamic and static conditions at 303 K. Percentage adsorption changes with different loading concentrations in MIL-53(Al) were compared (c). Dynamic (a) and static (b) photoswitching experiments for Mg-MOF-74@MR were carried out on days 1 and 2 respectively.Figure 3. CO2 uptake performance of Mg-MOF-74@MR at 303 K after relaxation.The photoresponse mechanism was investigated using similar analytical approaches to our previous work.(11, 40) Photoresponse was directly observed in UV\u2013vis and FT-IR spectra and indirectly through gas adsorption experiments. PXRD results confirmed that photoresponse occurred on a local scale as no large structural changes were observed.The UV\u2013vis spectrum of pure MR displayed characteristic absorption bands at 330 and 430 nm, which correspond to the cis and trans peaks respectively (Figure 4a). When irradiated with visible light, a large fraction of the trans isomers appeared to have converted to the cis isomer within 30 min as the trans and the cis absorption peaks decreased and increased respectively (Figure 4a). A similar trend was observed in both MOF@MR samples. Thus, the photoisomerization of MR in MOFs could be responsible for the photoresponse observed, in which the pore opening was obtained after 30 min of irradiation through the formation of more compact cis-MR guest molecules and reduced their contact with the host. It has been reported that the trans-to-cis photoisomerization of azobenzene derivatives in porous materials promoted the dipole\u2013quadrupole interaction between the pore surface and CO2 molecules, resulting in enhanced CO2 uptake.(40) Relaxation of MOF@MR back to the initial state under vacuum overnight in the dark suggested the formation of the trans-MR isomer.(15, 16)Figure 4. UV\u2013vis spectra of nonirradiated and irradiated MR (a), Mg-MOF-74@MR (b), and MIL-53(Al)@MR 50 wt % (c) in air with visible light (400\u2013500 nm).Upon visible light irradiation, the UV\u2013vis spectra of Mg-MOF-74@MR showed a slight increase in an absorption peak at 310 nm upon visible light irradiation, which could be attributed to the cis-MR formation (Figure 4b). The cis-MR appeared to be blue-shifted by \u223c50 nm, indicating MOF-MR interactions, as shown in the PXRD (Figure 4b, SI-2) and TGA (Figure SI-1a) results.(41) Reduction in the trans-MR peak was not detected as the MOF absorption peak at 400 nm may have masked it (Figure 4a-b, SI-4a).Figure 5. FT-IR spectra of nonirradiated and irradiated MR (a), Mg-MOF-74@MR (b), and MIL-53(Al)@MR (c) in air with visible light (400\u2013500 nm). The peak due to CO2 in the atmosphere at \u223c2450 cm\u20131 was omitted for clarity.Photoisomerization of MR was clearly observed in MIL-53(Al)@MR, in which the trans and cis peaks at 490 and 360 nm continually decreased and increased respectively upon visible light irradiation (Figure 4c). MOF-MR interactions were also observed as their absorption peaks were red-shifted by \u223c60 nm for trans and \u223c30 nm for cis (Figure 4c).(42-45) Both MOF@MR samples showed lower absorption intensities than that of the pure MR, which was expected due to higher MR concentration in the absence of the host. Furthermore, photoisomerization of some MR guest molecules may be hindered in MOFs.(5, 8, 46)In FT-IR studies, the irradiation of host free MR resulted in a peak shift from 1530 to 1520 cm\u20131 and the formation of characteristic peaks due to the azo group at 1560 and 1370 cm\u20131, C\u2550O at 1720 cm\u20131, C\u2013O at 1150 cm\u20131, and the phenyl group of trans-MR at 820 cm\u20131 reduced, which could be ascribed to the formation of the cis isomer (Figure 5a).(47, 48) There were very few similar peak changes observed in the MOF@MR samples as the signals due to most of the MR modes and MOF@MR may be too low or masked by their corresponding MOF peaks (Figure 5b-c). The peak at \u223c1700 cm-1 of MR was not observed in the IR spectrum of Mg-MOF-74@MR (Figure SI-5a). This could be due to the presence of MOF-MR interactions, as suggested in the UV\u2013vis and PXRD results (Figure 4 and Figure SI-9). In an irradiated Mg-MOF-74@MR\u2019s spectrum, the formation of the cis isomer may have been indicated by the formation of additional peaks at 1510 and 1540 cm\u20131 and reduction of a phenyl group peak at 680 cm\u20131 (Figure 5b). Similarly, an irradiated MIL-53(Al)@MR\u2019s spectrum displayed an increase in the peak intensity at 1510 cm\u20131 and reduction of peak intensities of the phenyl group, trans-azo group, and carbonyl group at 820, 1370, and 1740 cm\u20131 respectively (Figure 5c).Although formation of cis-MR isomers in both irradiated MOF@MR samples can be detected in UV\u2013vis and FT-IR spectra, X-ray diffraction suggested that photoresponse occurred on a local scale as only subtle changes were observed (Figures SI-2, SI-3, SI-9, SI-10). Mg-MOF-74@MR displayed a general blue-shift in peak positions from those observed in the activated Mg-MOF-74 itself, indicating there was a contraction within the MOF framework (Figure SI-2).(49) However, red and blue peak shifts were observed in MIL-53(Al)@MR, indicating that structural deformations were not unidirectional, which could be attributed to the shrinkage and expansion of the MOF framework (Figure SI-3).(49) These shifts were significantly more pronounced with higher guest loading (50 wt %), which could be due to the increase of packing density (Figure SI-3). The unidirectional shift observed in Mg-MOF-74@MR could be due to the rigid nature of the framework. The observed peak shifts suggested that perhaps MR molecules were coated on the MOF surface, covering the pore channels of the MOF framework. In addition to subtle peak shifts, a general broadening of peaks in both MOF@MR samples, which was further enhanced at higher guest loading, was observed (Figures SI-2, SI-3). Furthermore, there were no peaks due to the pure MR present in all diffraction patterns. Therefore, this may indicate the lowering of crystallinity due to the presence of MOF-MR interactions. This was further supported by the thermal behavior of these materials, in which there were red shifts in their degradation steps (Figure SI-1).Top of PageAbstractIntroductionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesConclusionsIn the preceding, an unusual phenomenon of on-demand access to internal MOF pores has been demonstrated. Building on our previous work with dynamic photoswitching to release adsorbed carbon dioxide, we have shown here that the more penetrating visible wavelengths can also be exploited. Mg-MOF-74 and MIL-53(Al) were coated in methyl red dye, which precluded access to the internal pores. Exposure of light to these composite materials induced structural changes in the methyl red dye that opened access to the internal MOF pores, concomitant with significant CO2 uptake capacity increases. In both MOF@MR materials, CO2 capture effect was more pronounced under static photoswitching conditions, which could be due to lower MR movement interference during CO2 measurement. Significant CO2 uptake and pore opening effect were observed when MOF@MR samples were irradiated as a result of MOF-MR interaction and photoisomerization of MR coated on the surface of the frameworks. In a more rigid environment (Mg-MOF-74@MR), a gate-opening effect was achieved, in which prolonged irradiation resulted in the increase in CO2 uptake adsorption of up to 84%. The level of photoresponse was also modulated through the use of different guest loading concentrations, as shown in the MIL-53(Al)@MR results, where photoresponses of 9% and 46% were obtained at lower guest loading (15 wt %) and higher guest loading (50 wt %) respectively. The visible light responsive nature of these MR loaded adsorbents represents a new sustainable strategy for lowering the cost and energy for sorbent regeneration, a main problem associated with conventional carbon capture technologies.
