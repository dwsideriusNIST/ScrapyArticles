{"abstract": "The high porosity of metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) has been used to achieve exceptional gas adsorptive properties but as yet remains largely unexplored for electrochemical energy storage devices. This study shows that MOFs made as nanocrystals (nMOFs) can be doped with graphene and successfully incorporated into devices to function as supercapacitors. A series of 23 different nMOFs with multiple organic functionalities and metal ions, differing pore sizes and shapes, discrete and infinite metal oxide backbones, large and small nanocrystals, and a variety of structure types have been prepared and examined. Several members of this series give high capacitance; in particular, a zirconium MOF exhibits exceptionally high capacitance. It has the stack and areal capacitance of 0.64 and 5.09 mF cm, about 6 times that of the supercapacitors made from the benchmark commercial activated carbon materials and a performance that is preserved over at least 10000 charge/discharge cycles.", "text": "10.1021/nn5027092 Electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors, represent an important class of energy storage devices because of their high power density.(1, 2) Porous carbon materials such as activated carbon are commercial supercapacitors that operate by storing charge on electrochemical double layers (EDLs).(3-5) This is in contrast to the storage of charge by redox reactions as exemplified by metal oxide pseudocapacitors.(6-8) Each of these classes of supercapacitors has strengths and weaknesses: carbon-based materials operate at a very high charge/discharge rate with a long life cycle but have low capacitance, while metal oxide materials have high capacitance but their redox reactions lead to low life cycle.(1)In this study, we show how metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs)(9) can be integrated into supercapacitor devices and the flexibility with which their metal oxide and organic constituents can be varied and used to uncover their high capacitance and long life cycle behavior; both are desirable features and sought after in supercapacitor research. We examined a series of 23 different MOF compounds, made in their nanocrystalline form, and chosen for their variability in structure type, organic functionality, geometry and size of metal-containing unit, size of pore, and size of the nanocrystals. Thin film devices prepared from these nanocrystalline MOFs (nMOFs) and doped with graphene give a wide range of stack capacitance (0.025 to 0.64 F cm\u20133). A member of the series, Zr6O4(OH)4(BPYDC)6 (BPYDC = 2,2\u2032-bipyridine-5,5\u2032-dicarboxylate, termed nMOF-867), has sp2 nitrogen atoms in the organic link and exhibits the highest stack and areal performance (0.64 and 5.09 mF cm\u20132)\u201426 times that of the lowest performing member of the series [Zn4O(BDC)1.67(C4H4\u2013BDC)1.33 (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), nMTV-MOF-5-AF (MTV = multivariate)] and six times that of commercial activated carbon. We further show that the exceptional performance of nMOF-867 is preserved over at least 10000 cycles. These findings constitute an important step in deploying the rich MOF chemistry for the development of supercapacitors.In addition to porous carbon and metal oxide materials, porous polymers have been investigated as supercapacitor and found to undergo chemical degradation, thus adversely affecting their life cycle and performance.(10) There is only one study involving the use of a MOF material [Co8-MOF-5, Zn3.68Co0.32O(BDC)3(DEF)0.75], which was found to have much lower capacitance than commercial activated carbon.(11) In the present report, we show that the ability to design nMOFs has led us to overcome these challenges and ultimately access nMOF based supercapacitors with superior performance.Top of PageAbstractResultsDiscussionConclusionMethodsReferencesResultsOur construct for incorporating nanocrystals of MOFs into supercapacitors is illustrated in Scheme 1. It is based on a coin-type device composed of films made from nMOFs doped with graphene. The films are placed on both sides of a separator membrane and soaked by a solution of an electrolyte. It is expected that by charging the device, the positive and negative ions of the electrolyte move in opposite directions through the separator and into the MOF pores. During discharge, the ions migrate out of the pores and the electrons flow out of the device. MOFs would perform well in this context because of their high porosity and openness of their structure, which should give high capacity for storage of ions and robust cycling of ions within the cell, respectively.(12)Scheme 1.

In cases where the metal salt is not that of the acetate, a modulator such as acetic acid or formic acid was added to control the crystal size. The nanocrystals were isolated by centrifuge, washed with a polar organic solvent, and then dried under vacuum. Samples of nMOFs thus produced were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) techniques to confirm their crystallinity and show that they have the same structure as the corresponding original bulk MOFs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine the size of the nanocrystals (Figure 1). Nitrogen gas adsorption isotherms were measured to confirm the porosity of the samples.Here, we outline the preparation, characterization, and fabrication of the film and device for the specific case of nHKUST-1 as this procedure was followed for the 23 nMOFs. Samples of nHKUST-1 were prepared by simultaneously adding a solution of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (126 mg, 0.600 mmol) with triethylamine (0.25 mL, 1.8 mmol) in 2 mL of DMF and a solution of Cu(OAc)2\u00b7H2O (215 mg, 1.08 mmol) in 5 mL of DMF to a solvent mixture containing DMF (18 mL), EtOH (25 mL), and H2O (25 mL). After 1 h of stirring, the product was collected using a centrifuge (9000 rpm, 20 min), washed with DMF (2 \u00d7 30 mL) and acetone (3 \u00d7 30 mL), and then dried in vacuo overnight. The crystallinity of nHKUST-1 was examined by PXRD, which gave sharp diffraction peaks matching those of the simulated pattern obtained from experimental X-ray single-crystal diffraction data (Figure 2a). The SEM of the product showed an average crystal size of 100 nm with a size distribution of 20% (Figure 1). The permanent porosity was confirmed by measuring the nitrogen gas sorption isotherm. It showed a shape similar to that observed for this MOF (Figure 2b) and gave a BET surface area of 1470 m2 g\u20131, a value within the range found for bulk HKUST-1 (1264 m2 g\u20131 to 1507 m2 g\u20131).(24, 25)The dried nHKUST-1 (70.0 mg) was dispersed with 53 \u03bcL of oleic acid in 4.6 mL of hexane under ultrasonication for 3 h. After the nHKUST-1 was separated from 1.0 mL of dispersion using a centrifuge (9000 rpm, 10 min), it was redispersed into 1.0 mL of hexane solution containing 0.5 mg mL\u20131 of graphene (3.3 wt % relative to nHKUST-1) previously dispersed by tip-sonic processor. This colloidal solution of nHKUST-1 and graphene was spread on cleaned titanium substrates and assembled into thin films of nHKUST-1 by using a spin-coating process (7000 rpm, 2 min). Finally, oleic acid was removed by immersing the nHKUST-1 film in acetone, drying with nitrogen flow, and outgassing at room temperature for 12 h (Supporting Information). This fabrication procedure yielded translucent blue nHKUST-1 thin films on a large-area transparent substrate (Figure 2c). The crystallinity and its porosity of the nHKUST-1 film were completely preserved (Figure 2a,b). The existence of graphene as a physical mixture with nHKUST-1 in the film was evident by measuring the Raman spectrum in three regions (labeled A\u2013C in Figure 2c). The spectrum showed peaks at 1350 and 1583\u20131616 cm\u20131 for defect (D band) and in-plane vibration (G band), corresponding to the sp2 carbon atoms of graphene (Figure 2d).(26) The SEM image of nHKUST-1 film showed a flat 2 \u03bcm thick film, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed particles of graphene distributed as a minority constituent in the nHKUST-1 film (Supporting Information, Figure S17).Figure 2. (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of nHKUST-1 and nHKUST-1 film.

(d) Raman spectroscopy from the three points marked as A, B, and C in Figure 1c as well as pristine nHKUST-1 and graphene.For the fabrication of the nMOF supercapacitor, two nHKUST-1 films were sandwiched with a separator (monolayer polypropylene separator membranes, thickness 25 \u03bcm, Celgard) in a coin-shaped cell and soaked with a 1 M solution of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate, (C2H5)4NBF4, in acetonitrile. The diameter of (C2H5)4N+ and BF4\u2013 is 0.68 and 0.33 nm, respectively.(27) After the coin-shaped cell was sealed, charge/discharge profiles, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and life cycle were all measured by galvanostatic measurements. Charge/discharge profiles of the nHKUST-1 supercapacitor were first measured to give its capacitance, energy, and power density in the various current densities with the potential swept in a range of the cutoff values (0 \u2264 E \u2264 2.7 V). All values were calculated in volumetric and areal performance of the stack (this includes a pair of active material and substrate, and the separator)(28) (Supporting Information). Measurements of CV and cycling profile were followed to investigate its electrochemical behavior and life cycle. The capacitance is plotted as a function of current density in Figure 3, and values of the maximum stack and areal capacitance and life cycle for all nMOF supercapacitors are listed in Table 1. In addition, galvanostatic, CV curves, and cycle profiles for all nMOF supercapacitors are presented in the Supporting Information.Figure 3.

Combinations containing C, D, or E functionalities outperform others with A, B, or F. The F functionality leads to poor performance, most likely because it blocks the pores as shown in their N2 adsorption data (Supporting Information, Figure S2), while C, D, and E combinations are relatively better. However, the capacitance of this entire series is lower than that observed for activated carbon. MOF-74 has a metal oxide backbone linked by organic units and is known to incorporate multiple metal ions without changing the MOF structure (Supporting Information, Figures S5 and S6 and Table S1). Mixing more than three metals in this MOF series (Figure 3c and Table 1) gives better performance than the original unmixed ones, which is attributed to redox reactions in charge/discharge process as observed in their CV profiles (Supporting Information, Figure S53\u2013S57). In general, these highly mixed metal compounds perform better than any of the nMTV-MOF-5 members. This is in contrast to the inferior performance of the nanocrystals of MOF-177 and ZIF-8 (Figure 3d). An important MOF is HKUST-1 because it has three-dimensional pores with open metal sites in the backbone structure that point into the pores. The performance of nHKUST-1 is better than that of both the MTV-MOF-5 and MOF-74 series, and its maximum capacitance is three times that of activated carbon (Figure 3d and Table 1). We believe that the crystallinity and porosity of nMOFs contribute to their high performance: we synthesized a nonporous and noncrystalline Cu-BTC-NPNC, which has the same constituents as nHKUST-1, and found that it gave very low capacitance (Figure 3d and Table 1). The use of nHKUST-1 without doping with graphene (nHKUST-1-NG) also gives very low capacitance and points to the key role doped graphene plays in enhancing electron mobility within these devices. However, control experiments with increased ratios of graphene in the nHKUST-1 film show decreased capacitance (Supporting Information), which further confirms the importance of the nMOFs as the active material giving the high performance.Members of a new class of chemically and thermally stable MOFs based on zirconium(IV) show progressively better performance as pore diameter decreased from nUiO-67 (9.6 and 12.6 \u00c5) to nUiO-66 (6.8 and 7.2 \u00c5) to nMOF-801 (5.4 and 7.0 \u00c5) with the latter two exhibiting higher performance than any of the MOFs already discussed. Meanwhile, nMOF-808 having two different pore diameters (4.6 and 18.4 \u00c5) is found to give an intermediate performance. It is worth noting that for films based on nMOF-801 with different nanocrystal sizes (nMOF-801 and nMOF-801-L with 100 and 500 nm, respectively), a lower performance is observed for the larger nanocrystals (Figure 3e and Table 1).Remarkably, we found that using nMOF-867 whose structure is the same as nUiO-67 but with 2,2\u2032-bipyridine instead of biphenyl gives the highest performance (Figure 3f and Table 1). The capacitance of this material (0.644 F cmstack\u20133 and 5.085 mF cmareal\u20132) is over 6 and 10 times that of activated carbon (0.100 F cmstack\u20133 and 0.788 mF cmareal\u20132) and graphene (0.065 F cmstack\u20133 and 0.515 mF cmareal\u20132), respectively. The gravimetric capacitance of nMOF-867 is 726 F gnMOF-867/electrode\u20131 (Supporting Information). The maximum energy and power densities of nMOF-867 are 6.04 \u00d7 10\u20134 Wh cmstack\u20133 (3.85 \u00d7 10\u20133 mWh cmareal\u20132) and 1.097 W cmstack\u20133 (8.67 mW cmareal\u20132), respectively (Figure 4a). At the power density of 0.386 W cmstack\u20133, the energy density (2.86 \u00d7 10\u20134 Wh cmstack\u20133) of nMOF-867 is over three times that of activated carbon (1.00 \u00d7 10\u20134 Wh cmstack\u20133). Moreover, at this power density, nMOF-867 consistently preserves its performance for at least 10000 cycles under the condition of extended exposure to the maximum voltage (0\u20132.7 V) (Figure 4b). Considering the similarity in chemical composition, crystal structure, porosity (Supporting Information), and electrochemical behavior observed in the CV data (Supporting Information, Figures S61 and S62) of nUiO-67 and nMOF-867, it is noteworthy that the sp2 nitrogen atoms in nMOF-867 contribute to increase the interaction with ions significantly and enhanced the device performance.(29, 30)Figure 4. Energy and power densities and life cycle for supercapacitors: (a) Energy and power densities of nMOF-867 compared with activated carbon; (b) life cycle for nMOF-867.Top of PageAbstractResultsDiscussionConclusionMethodsReferencesConclusionWe targeted 23 porous metal\u2013organic frameworks representing a diversity of structure types and metrics, and sizes and functionalities of pores, for their synthesis in nanocrystalline form and study of their performance and properties as supercapacitors. It is significant that the charge/discharge profiles (Supporting Information, Figures S19\u2013S42), CV curves (Supporting Information, Figures S43\u2013S66), and cycling performance (Supporting Information, Figures S67\u2013S90) of these nMOFs follow the general behavior observed in other supercapacitors.(1-7) The differences are in the details of the nMOF electrochemical behavior; perhaps their diverse structural and functionality attributes are directly involved in electrochemical processes, and depending on their chemical nature, some undergo redox reactions, which makes several of these nMOFs exceed the capacitance of the benchmark materials. Future work will focus on deciphering the specific impact of these factors on the observed high capacitance of nMOFs.Top of PageAbstractResultsDiscussionConclusionMethodsReferencesMethodsPreparation of nMOFsDetailed synthetic procedures for all nMOFs are described in the Supporting Information. Here, we describe the preparation method for nHKUST-1, representatively. A 126 mg portion of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTCH3) and 0.25 mL of triethylamine were dissolved in 2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), while 215 mg of Cu(OAc)2\u00b7H2O was dissolved in 5 mL of DMF. The solutions of 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and Cu(OAc)2\u00b7H2O was combined in a mixture of DMF (18 mL), EtOH (25 mL), and H2O (25 mL) and stirred vigorously for 1 h at ambient temperature. The resultant nHKUST-1 was washed twice with DMF using a centrifuge (9000 rpm for 20 min) and sonication and then sequentially immersed in acetone for three 24 h periods. Finally, nHKUST-1 was activated by removing the solvent under vacuum overnight.Preparation of nMOF FilmsA 70 mg portion of the nMOF was mixed and dispersed with 53 \u03bcL of oleic acid in 4.6 mL of hexane (nMOF/hexane dispersion) by sonication for 3 h. At the same time, graphene layers (0.5 mg mL\u20131) were separated in hexane by using a tip-sonic processor for a total of 40 min (4 \u00d7 10 min operation) and continuously sonicated in the ultrasonic bath (40 kHz) to keep their dispersion (graphene/hexane dispersion). After the nMOF was separated from 1 mL of nMOF/hexane dispersion using a centrifuge (9000 rpm, 10 min), it was redispersed in 1 mL of graphene/hexane dispersion (0.5 mg mL\u20131) to make a nMOF and graphene dispersion in hexane (nMOF/graphene/hexane dispersion). In the meantime, substrates were cleaned with hypophosphorous acid (50 wt % solution in water) for 1 h after washing with acetone, ethanol, and water. The nMOF/graphene/hexane dispersion was coated on the cleaned substrates in the spin coater (7000 rpm, 2 min) to give a 2 \u03bcm thickness of nMOF film. Oleic acid was removed by immersing the nMOF film in acetone, drying with nitrogen flow, and outgassing at room temperature for 12 h. All processes were done in succession.Fabrication of SupercapacitorsFor the fabrication of supercapacitors, two nMOF film samples, separator and electrolyte, were assembled in a coin-shaped cell. Specifically, two pieces of nMOF film (2 \u03bcm) on Ti substrates (25 \u03bcm) were sandwiched with a separator (monolayer polypropylene separator membranes, thickness 25 \u03bcm, Celgard) and soaked in 1.0 M of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate ((C2H5)4NBF4) in acetonitrile. After the coin-shaped cell was sealed, supercapacitors were electrochemically tested using galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The same method was applied for all of the supercapacitors in this paper.The authors declare no competing financial interest.Top of PageAbstractResultsDiscussionConclusionMethodsReferencesAcknowledgmentThis research was supported by BASF SE (Ludwigshafen, Germany) at UC Berkeley, the Global Frontier R&D Program (2013-073298) of the Center for Hybrid Interface Materials (HIM), and the National Research Foundation of Korea (2011-0028737) at KAIST-Korea.
