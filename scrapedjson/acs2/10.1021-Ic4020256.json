Therefore, how to avoid this interpenetrating phenomenon is challenging and significant. One effective method is to decorate the nanosized organic ligand via adding some large hindrance groups, but these hindrance groups can reduce the size of the channels. Another feasible way recently reported by Yaghi and co-workers is to use in situ generated rod-shaped metal\u2013carboxylate secondary building units (SBUs),(8) the rigidity of the rod-shaped SBUs effectively avoids interpenetration due to the intrinsic packing arrangement of such rods in the crystal structure. As a nanosized N-centered carboxylate ligand, tris((4-carboxyl)phenylduryl)amine (H3L) has been used to synthesize two noninterpenetrated MOFs by our group, which are also constructed by rod-shaped metal\u2013carboxylate SBUs,(9b) but none of them were lanthanide\u2013organic frameworks.In this work, by employing the H3L ligand to assemble with Ln3+ ions, we successfully synthesized four isostructural noninterpenetrating MOFs containing the infinite rod-shaped SBUs, namely, [Ln(L)]\u00b71.5H2O\u00b70.5EtOH\u00b7DMF (Ln = Ce (FIR-8), Pr (FIR-9), Nd (FIR-10), Sm (FIR-11)). However, the presence of five drops of HCOOH in the reaction system gives four other isostructural 8-fold interpenetrated diamondoid MOFs built by small-sized and mononuclear SBUs, namely, (Me2NH2)[Ln(HL)2(H2O)2]\u00b71.5H2O\u00b7DMF (Ln = Ce (FIR-12), Pr (FIR-13), Nd (FIR-14), Sm (FIR-15)). FIR-8 shows a high permanent porosity with a Langmuir surface area of 633.8 m2\u00b7g\u20131 and a high H2 uptake of 165.2 cm3\u00b7g\u20131 at 77 K and 1 atm. However, FIR-12 with smaller pores can hardly adsorb N2 and H2. Second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements reveal that FIR-8 and FIR-12 display strong powder SHG efficiencies. In addition, the fluorescent emissions of all the compounds in the solid state are also investigated.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental sectionResults and DiscussionConclusionReferencesExperimental sectionMaterials and InstrumentationAll reagents were purchased commercially and used without further purification. The purity of all gases is 99.999%. All syntheses were carried out in a 20 mL vial under autogenous pressure. Diffraction data were collected by using a Bruker Smart Apex CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.710\u200973 \u01fa) at 293 K. Absorption correction was applied by using SADABS. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares technique by using SHELXTL.(17) All Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses were recorded on a Rigaku Dmax2500 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.540\u200956 \u00c5) with a step size of 0.05\u00b0. Thermal stability studies were carried out on a NETSCHZ STA-449C thermoanalyzer with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. Gas adsorption measurement was performed in the ASAP (Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry) 2020 System. Nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were measured by Kurtz\u2013Perry powder SHG test using an Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) with an input pulse of 350 mV.

Herein, only the Ce\u2013organic framework (FIR-8) is described in detail. X-ray single crystal diffraction reveals that compound FIR-8 crystallizes in the acentric Pnc2 space group. The asymmetric unit contains one crystallographically independent Ce3+ ion and one L3\u2013 ligand. As shown in Figure 1a, each Ce(III) atom is nine coordinated to nine oxygen atoms from six distinct L3\u2013 ligands. Each carboxyl in a L3\u2013 ligand links two Ce(III) ions in a \u03b7-O,O\u2032-\u03bc-O,O coordination mode (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The Ce\u2013Ocarboxyl bond lengths fall into the range of 2.435\u20132.595 \u00c5, which are comparable to previously reported Ce-contained MOFs.(10) The adjacent Ce(III) ions were linked by three carboxylate groups that adopted the \u03b7-O,O\u2032-\u03bc-O,O coordination mode to form an infinite rod-shape [Ce(COO)3]n chain with a Ce\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce distance of 3.772 \u00c5 running along the c direction (Figure 1a). Each [Ce(COO)3]n chain acts as secondary building units (SBUs) and is further connected near six chains by L ligands to form a noninterpenetrated three-dimensional (3D) architecture containing one-dimensional (1D) channels with sizes of \u223c7 \u00c5 viewing in the c direction (Figure 1b). Similarly to FIR-8, many reported MOFs constructed from rod-shaped SBUs and long multicarboxylic ligands are usually noninterpenetrated, leaving large pores or cages for gas sorption and separation.(9) The total potential void volume of open channels in FIR-8 is about 31.8% calculated by the PLATON.Figure 1. (a) Metal\u2013carboxylate chain and (b) 3D framework of FIR-8.Interestingly, when five drops of HCOOH were added to the reaction system of FIR-8 and the pH value was \u223c4.5, another series of Ln\u2013tris((4-carboxyl)phenylduryl)amine frameworks (Me2NH2)[Ln(HL)2(H2O)2]\u00b71.5H2O\u00b7DMF containing FIR-12 (Ce), FIR-13 (Pr), FIR-14 (Nd), and FIR-15 (Sm) were obtained. Thus, it can be seen that the pH value plays a very important role in constructing different MOFs, especially Ln MOFs. Here, the structure of FIR-12 is selected to discuss in detail. The X-ray structure of FIR-12 reveals an 8-fold interpenetrating dia network that is different from FIR-8. The crystal structure of FIR-12 was solved in the acentric space group Aba2. In FIR-12, each Ce(III) atom is eight coordinated by six oxygen atoms from four distinct ligands and two H2O oxygen atoms (Figure S3, Supporting Information). In fact, the incomplete deprotonated tricarboxylate ligand serves as a bent dicarboxylate linker in FIR-12. Thus, each HL2\u2013 ligand links two Ce(III) atoms and every Ce(III) atom is connected by four HL2\u2013 lignads to generate a diamond network (Figure 2a). The diamondoid cage has an edged Ce\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce distance of 23.6 \u00c5 and a maximum Ce\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ce distance of 71.5 \u00c5 (Figure 2a). Such an unusual large cavity induces an 8-fold interpenetrating framework (Figure 2b). Up to now, a large number of interpenetrating MOFs with dia topology have been investigated and discussed,(11) but the one based on the C3 symmetric carboxylate linker is rarely seen. The overall framework of FIR-12 is anionic, and each Ce3+ ion is corresponding to one (Me2NH2)+ cation resolved from the decomposition of DMF solvent molecules. The solvent-accessible volume of FIR-12 without guest and (Me2NH2)+ cations is only 22.6% per unit cell calculated by PLATON. Apparently, small-sized, low-nuclear SBU and larger bridged ligands usually facilitate interpenetrated phenomenon, which limits the pore size and influences adsorptive properties.Figure 2. (a) Diamondoid cage in FIR-12, (b) 8-fold interpenetrating 3D architecture, and (c) view of the dia net in FIR-12.The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of FIR-8 reveals a weight loss of 14.5% in the range of 120\u2013260 \u00b0C (Figure S5, Supporting Information), which is corresponding to one and a half H2O, half of EtOH, and one DMF guests. The result is also determined by elemental analysis (calcd 14.21%). Only a slight weight loss is observed between 260 and 500 \u00b0C, suggesting that no chemical decomposition occurs between the desolvating and ligand-releasing temperatures. For FIR-12, a lower weight loss of \u223c9% corresponding to the release of one and a half H2O, one DMF, and two coordinated H2O molecules (calcd 8.89%) can be seen (Figure S6, Supporting Information). For gas sorption studies, they were exchanged by EtOH and activated at 90 \u00b0C for 7 h under high vacuum, forming the hollow samples FIR-8a-ht and FIR-12a-ht, respectively. The PXRD patterns of two compounds before and after removing solvent confirm the keeping of porosities (Figures S7 and S8, Supporting Information).To investigate the permanent porosity of desolvated FIR-8a-ht and FIR-12a-ht, the gas sorption experiments of N2 and H2 were measured at 77 K (Figure 3a). The N2 sorption isotherm of FIR-8a-ht reveals a typical type-I sorption behavior and N2 uptake of \u223c149.7 cm3\u00b7g\u20131 at 1 atm, giving BET and Langmuir surface areas of 457.1 and 633.8 m2\u00b7g\u20131, respectively. However, FIR-12a-ht can hardly adsorb N2 (5.4 cm3\u00b7g\u20131) and H2 (4.7 cm3\u00b7g\u20131) because of the size-exclusion effect in the high-fold interpenetrated FIR-12a-ht with small pores. Compared to previous FIR-5a-ht,(9b) which also possesses an inorganic rod-shape chain and a Langmuir surface area of 1457 m2\u00b7g\u20131, the surface area of FIR-8a-ht is inferior. However, the H2 uptake capacity, 165.2 cm3\u00b7g\u20131 (1.48 wt %) at 77 K and 1 atm, is higher than that for FIR-5a-ht (109.6 cm3\u00b7g\u20131, 0.98 wt %) and comparable to those of recently reported MOFs at the same condition.(12) In addition, the CO2 uptakes of FIR-8a-ht are 63 and 39 cm3\u00b7g\u20131 at 273 and 298 K under 1 atm, respectively (Figure 3b).Figure 3. (a) N2 and H2 adsorption isotherms for FIR-8a-ht and FIR-12a-ht at 77 K, (b) CO2 adsorption isotherms for FIR-8a-ht at 273 and 298 K, and (c) C3H8, C2H6, C2H4, and CH4 sorption isotherms of FIR-8a-ht at 298 K. Solid symbols, adsorption; open symbols, desorption.We also measured the pure component sorption isotherms of various hydrocarbons for FIR-8a-ht at 298 K under 1 atm. As shown in Figure 3c, FIR-8a-ht takes up different amounts of C3H8 (53.3 cm3\u00b7g\u20131), C2H6 (54.1 cm3\u00b7g\u20131), C2H4 (54.7 cm3\u00b7g\u20131), and CH4 (15.3 cm3\u00b7g\u20131) at 298 K. Although the maximum uptake of C3H8, C2H6, and C2H4 is significantly lower than that for MOF-74 with unsaturated metal ions under the same condition,(13) the C2H6 and C2H4 uptake capacities are better than those for UTSA-35a and UTSA-36a, as previously reported by Chen et al.(14)Because FIR-8 and FIR-12 crystallize in noncentrosymmetric space groups, their second-harmonic generation properties were also studied by using an Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) (Figure 4). The second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements were carried out on the microcrystalline samples, using 1064 nm radiation, and the results reveal that the bulk materials for FIR-8 and FIR-12 display strong powder SHG efficiencies, which are approximately 8 and 3 times that of a potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) powder in the particle size of 125\u2013180 \u03bcm, and further confirms their acentricity as well as evaluates their potential as second-order NLO materials. The phase matching curves are shown in Figure 4b. The SHG intensity of FIR-8 is higher than those of Zn(tzbc)2 (tzbc = 4-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) benzoic acid) and (Me2NH2)[CdLi(odba)2] (odba = 4,4\u2032-oxidibenzoate) with 5-fold interpenetrating diamondoid networks.(15)Figure 4. (a) Comparison of the measured SHG response of FIR-8 and FIR-12 with that of KDP at the same particle size of 125\u2013180 \u03bcm and (b) phase-matching curves (i.e., particle size versus SHG response) for FIR-8, FIR-12, and KDP.The solid-state emission spectra of compounds FIR-8 to FIR-15 together with the H3L ligand in this work have been investigated at room temperature. It is shown that the free H3L ligand displays the emission maxima at 494 nm, which can be assigned to the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition (Figure 5). Apparently, all of the compounds have a peak similar to that of the ligand with a maximum absorption emission band range from 478 to 493 nm, which exhibits a slight blue-shift compared with the emission peak of the H3L ligand. In this case, the ligand-based luminescence dominates and the blue-shifted phenomenon may possibly be attributed to the metal\u2013ligand coordinative interactions. However, except for the ligand-based emission, compound FIR-15 shows other four emission peaks at 558, 594, 642, and 701 nm, which are corresponding to the 4G5/2\u00a0\u2192 6H5/2, 4G5/2 \u2192 6H7/2, 4G5/2 \u2192 6H9/2, and 4G5/2 \u2192 6H11/2 characteristic transitions of the Sm3+ ion,(16) respectively, but these characteristic peaks are not obvious in the compound FIR-11. The photographs of the corresponding samples under laboratory UV light are seen in Figure S11 (Supporting Information).Figure 5. Solid-state emission spectra (\u03bbex = 360 nm) measured in air at room temperature of H3L ligand and compounds FIR-8 to FIR-15.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental sectionResults and DiscussionConclusionReferencesConclusionIn summary, by controlling the pH value of the reaction system, two sets of Ln\u2013tris((4-carboxyl)phenylduryl)amine (Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) frameworks with distinct structural features have been generated. They exhibit a noninterpenetrating rod-packing architecture (FIR-8 to FIR-11) and an 8-fold interpenetrating dia-type framework (FIR-12 to FIR-15), respectively. The noninterpenetrating type FIR-8 has high surface area and high H2 uptake capacity. However, the interpenetrating type FIR-12 with smaller pores can hardly adsorb N2 and H2. Surprisingly, FIR-8 and FIR-12 display strong powder SHG efficiencies, which are approximately 8 and 3 times as strong as that of a KDP powder. In addition, different from other compounds, except the ligand-based emission, compound FIR-15 also shows four characteristic emission peaks of the Sm3+ ion. The results reveal that these multifunctional Ln\u2013tris((4-carboxyl)phenylduryl)amine framework materials have potential applications in gas sorption, second-order nonlinear optics and luminescence.
