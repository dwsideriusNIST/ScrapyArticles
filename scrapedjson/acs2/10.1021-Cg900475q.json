Thus, by using N,N-piperazine(bis-methylenephosphonic acid) [H2O3PCH2\u2212N(C2H4)2NCH2PO3H2, LH4], compounds La2(LH2)2(LH4)Cl2, La2(LH2)2(LH3)Cl,(9) Gd2(LH2)3\u00b73H2O, and Nd2(LH2)3\u00b79H2O(10) were obtained which show open framework structures in which the inorganic chains composed of corner-sharing {LaO7} and {PO3C} polyhedra are linked through organic moieties. Mixed ligated compounds [Ln2(HL\u2032)(H2L)2(H2O)4]\u00b78H2O (Ln = La, Nd; H3L\u2032 = m-sulfophenylphosphonic acid) were also obtained which contain tetranuclear cluster units interconnected by the same phosphonate ligand (H2L2\u2212).(11) Large pore is achieved in [Ln(H2L\u2032\u2032(NO3)(H2O)2]\u00b72H2O\u00b72MeOH where 26,28-dihydroxy-25,27- dimethoxycalix[4]arene-11,23-diphosphonate (L\u2032\u20324\u2212) are linked by Ln3+ ions.(12)With regard to compounds containing both phosphonate and carboxylate groups, Pr4(H2O)7(O3PCH2\u2212NC5H9\u2212COO)4(H2O)5 provides the first open framework lanthanide carboxyphosphonate, where one-dimensional (1D) inorganic chains made up of corner- and edge-sharing {PrO8} and {PrO9} are linked by (4-carboxypiperidyl)-N-methylenephosphonate.(13) Isostructural lanthanide carboxyphosphonates Ln(HPMIDA)(H2O)2\u00b7H2O (Ln = Gd, Tb, Dy, Y, Er, Yb, Lu), based on N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic anion (H4PMIDA), are reported which exhibit three-dimensional (3D) open framework structures with helical tunnels.(14) The reactions of 1-phosphonomethylproline with lanthanide salts result in chiral porous compounds Ln[(S)-HO3PCH2NHC4H7CO2]3\u00b72H2O (Ln = Tb, Dy, Eu, Gd) built from 1D triple-strand helical chains.(15) A few lanthanide oxalatophosphonates with open framework structures are also described.(6, 16)In this paper, we describe four new isostructural lanthanide carboxyphosphonates Ln(O3PCH2\u2212NC5H9\u2212COO)(H2O)2\u00b7xH2O [Ln = Eu(1), Gd(2), Tb(3), Dy(4)]. All exhibit open framework structures containing parallelogram-like channels.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionReferencesExperimental SectionMaterials and Methods(4-Carboxypiperidyl)-N-methylenephosphonic acid (4-cpmpH3) was prepared according to the literature method.(17) All other reagents were purchased as reagent grade chemicals and used without further purification. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C elemental analyzer. The IR spectra were obtained as KBr disks on a VECTOR 22 spectrometer. Magnetic susceptibility data of compound 2 were obtained on microcrystalline sample (8.13 mg), using a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer. Diamagnetic corrections were made for both the sample holder and the compound estimated from Pascal\u2019s constants.(18)Syntheses of Ln(O3PCH2\u2212NC5H9\u2212COO)(H2O)2\u00b7xH2O [Ln3+ = Eu (1), Gd (2), Tb (3), Dy (4)]Compounds 1\u22124 were synthesized following a similar procedure.

The data were integrated using the Siemens SAINT program,(19) with the intensities corrected for Lorentz factor, polarization, air absorption, and absorption due to variation in the path length through the detector faceplate. Multiscan absorption corrections were applied. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F2 by full matrix least-squares using SHELXTL.(20) All the non-hydrogen atoms were located from the Fourier maps and were refined anisotropically. All H atoms were refined isotropically, with the isotropic vibration parameters related to the non-H atom to which they are bonded.

It is found that the pH values play a key role in the formation of four compounds. The pH value above 4.0 results in flocculent mixture, whereas the pH value below 3 leads to a lower yield, and even clear solution. Compounds with good crystal quality and high yields are obtained in the pH values between 3.5 and 4.0.Crystal structuresCompounds 1\u22124 are isostructural and crystallize in monoclinic space group P21/c. As shown in Figure 1, the building unit of 1 contains one Eu atom, one 4-cpmp3\u2212 ligand, two coordination and one lattice water molecules. Each Eu is eight-coordinated by four phosphonate oxygens (O1, O2, O2C, and O3B) from three equivalent 4-cpmp3\u2212 ligands, two carboxylate oxygens (O4D and O5D) from the fourth equivalent 4-cpmp3\u2212 ligand and two water oxygens (O1W and O2W). The Eu\u2212O bond lengths and the O\u2212Eu\u2212O bond angles are in the normal range of 2.280(5)\u22122.534(5) \u00c5 and 52.00(18)\u2212161(3)\u00b0, respectively.Figure 1. Building unit of structure 1 with atomic labeling scheme (50% probability). All H atoms are omitted for clarity.Each 4-cpmp3\u2212 serves as a pentadentate ligand, binding four Eu atoms through three phosphonate oxygens (O1, O2, O3) and two carboxylate oxygens (O4, O5) (Scheme 1a). The phosphonate oxygen O2 bridges two equivalent Eu atoms, forming a dimer of {Eu2O14} with the Eu1C\u2212O2\u2212Eu1 bond angle of 113.5(2)o. The dimers are connected by {PO3C} tetrahedra through corner- or edge-sharing, resulting in a 1D double chain running along the a-axis (Figure 2). Within the chain, the Eu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Eu distances over \u03bc3-O2, O1\u2212P1\u2212O3, and O2\u2212P1\u2212O3 bridges are 4.031, 5.485, and 5.552 \u00c5, respectively. The chain is further linked to its four equivalent neighbors through the coordination of the phosphonate and carboxylate oxygens to the Eu atoms, leading to a 3D open framework containing uniform large parallelogram-like channels with the size of 15.978 \u00d7 9.777 \u00c5 (van der Waals radii not accounted) (Figure 3). The lattice water molecules fill in these channels and are involved in hydrogen bonding networks formed among phosphonate oxygens (O3, O4) and lattice waters (O3W, O4W, O5W). The three shortest contacts are 2.779 \u00c5 for O3W\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O4a, 3.029 \u00c5 for O4W\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O5Wb, and 3.034 \u00c5 for O4W\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O3Wc (symmetry codes: a: x \u2212 1, \u2212y + 1/2, z + 1/2; b: \u2212x, \u2212y + 1, \u2212z + 1; c: x, \u2212y + 1/2, z \u2212 1/2).Scheme 1Figure 2. One inorganic chain in structure 1.Figure 3. (a) Structure 1 packed along the a-axis. The lattice water molecules are omitted for clarity. (b) The channel in structure 1.The structures of 2\u22124 are analogous to 1 except that the Eu atom in 1 is replaced by Gd in 2, Tb in 3, and Dy in 4. The crystal cell volume decreases in the decreasing sequence of ionic radii with Eu > Gd > Tb > Dy. The Ln\u2212O distances and O\u2212Ln\u2212O bond angles are 2.273(4)\u22122.536(4) \u00c5 and 51.70(15)\u2212161(2)o for 2, 2.267(4)\u22122.526(4) \u00c5 and 51.87(14)\u2212161(2)o for 3, and 2.262(7)\u22122.520(7) \u00c5 and 51.8(2)\u2212161(3)o for 4, respectively. The sizes of the channels are 15.978 \u00d7 9.792 \u00c5 in 2, 15.920 \u00d7 9.734 \u00c5 in 3, and 15.879 \u00d7 9.733 \u00c5 in 4.The open-framework structures of 1\u22124 are different from that of Pr4(H2O)7(O3PCH2\u2212NC5H9\u2212COO)4(H2O)5. In the latter case, chains of edge-sharing {PrO8} and {PrO9} polyhedra are observed, which are interconnected via organic acids to create an open framework structure. While in 1\u22124, the inorganic chain is built from dimers of edge-sharing {LnO8} connected by {PO3C} linkages. Further, each chain is linked by its four equivalents via eight 4-cpmp3\u2212 ligands in Pr4(H2O)7(O3PCH2\u2212NC5H9\u2212COO)4(H2O)5, instead of four 4-cpmp3\u2212 in 1\u22124. Finally, the coordination modes of 4-cpmp3\u2212 in 1\u22124 (Scheme 1a) are also different from those in Pr4(H2O)7(O3PCH2\u2212NC5H9\u2212COO)4(H2O)5 (Scheme 1b\u2212d). It is worth noting that a few transition metal phosphonates based on 4-cpmp3\u2212 were also reported, including Mn(O3PCH2\u2212NHC5H9\u2212COO),(17) Zn(O3PCH2\u2212NHC5H9\u2212COO), and Co3(O3PCH2\u2212NHC5H9\u2212COO)2(O3PCH2\u2212NC5H10)(H2O).(21) Their structures, however, are all pillared layered, and the 4-cpmpH2\u2212 ligand adopts two other coordination modes (Scheme 1e,f).Thermal AnalysisIn order to explore the thermal stability of these materials, the TG curves of 1\u22124 were measured. The first step decomposition appears in the temperature range 50\u2212235 \u00b0C, with a weight loss of about 17.1% for 1, 15.6% for 2, 16.7% for 3, and 15.0% for 4. These values are in agreement with the theoretical values expected for the release of two coordinated and two lattice water molecules (16.2% for 1, 16.0% for 2, 16.0% for 3, 15.8% for 4). A plateau appears in the range 235\u2212348 \u00b0C in all four cases, above which a rapid weight loss occurs, corresponding to the decomposition of the organic ligands and the collapse of the structure. In order to determine whether the framework is maintained after dehydration, compounds 1\u22124 were heated at 110 \u00b0C for 2 h. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements reveal that the dehydrated samples become amorphous.Luminescent and Magnetic PropertiesThe solid-state luminescent properties of compounds 1 and 3 were investigated at room temperature under excitation at 395 nm for 1, and 376 nm for 3, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, compound 1 emits strong red luminescence characteristic for the f\u2212f transitions of Eu3+ ion. The emission bands at 592, 616, 698 and 650 nm are attributed to 5D0 \u2192 7FJ (J = 1\u22124) transitions. Compound 3 shows four emission bands at 489 nm (5D4 \u2192 7F6), 545 nm (5D4 \u2192 7F5), 583 nm, 590 nm (5D4 \u2192 7F4), and 622 nm (5D4 \u2192 7F3). The most intensive one is 5D4 \u2192 7F5, in accordance with the typical Tb3+ ion emission spectrum.(22) The observed luminescent lifetimes are \u03c41 = 0.84 \u03bcs (43.21%), \u03c42 = 3.04 \u03bcs (20.31%), and \u03c43 = 18.76 \u03bcs (36.48%) for 1, and \u03c41 = 1.12 \u03bcs (61.35%), \u03c42 = 11.95 \u03bcs (38.65%) for 3.Figure 4. Room temperature emission spectra of 1 (left) and 3 (right).The magnetic behavior of 2 is given in Figure 5 in the forms of \u03c7M and \u03c7M\u22121 vs T plots. At 300 K, the effective magnetic moment per Gd (7.81 \u03bcB) agrees well with the spin only value of 7.94 \u03bcB for S = 7/2. The magnetic behavior follows the Curie\u2212Weiss law in the whole temperature range, leading to a Curie constant of 7.67 cm3\u00b7K\u00b7mol\u22121 and a very small Weiss constant \u03b8 = \u22120.054 \u039a which suggests that compound 2 is paramagnetic.Figure 5.
