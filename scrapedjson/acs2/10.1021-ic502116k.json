Other tetraarylporphyrin, such as meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP) and meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP), have been also utilized for the construction of MOFs.(32-38) In particular, the Zhou research group recently reported a Zr6-cluster-based mesoporous porphyrin MOF [PCN-222(Fe)] containing large one-dimensional hexagonal open channels with a large diameter of 3.7 nm based on TCPP that displays exceptionally high water stability.(39) In addition, Ma and co-workers successfully strutted several isophthalate-derived porphyrin ligands in constructing nanoscopic polyhedral cage-containing metal\u2013metalloporphyrin frameworks.(40-44) On the other hand, tetrazolate heterocycles can form a number of MOFs with different topologies and applications.(45, 46) Compared with imidazole, pyrazole, and triazole, 5-substituted tetrazolate ligands are  much less developed for constructing MOF materials.(47-49) Long and co-workers reported several MOFs from polytetrazolates displaying pyrazolate coordination modes.(50-53) They also synthesized a number of highly porous frameworks from M4Cl(ttz)8-(solv)4 clusters (M = Mn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Ni2+; ttz = tetrazole) and triangular polytetrazolate ligands. In this contribution, we herein present the structure of the first example of a (tetrazolyl)porphyrin-based MOF, {Mn(II)0.5[Mn(II)4Cl(Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp)2(H2O)4]}\u00b7(DEF)20\u00b7(CH3OH)18\u00b7(H2O)12 (UTSA-57), constructed from the metalloligand {5,10,15,20-tetrakis[4-(2,3,4,5-tetrazolyl)phenyl]porphyrinato} manganese(III) chloride [denoted as Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp, Scheme 1] with a three-dimensional robust microporous structure. UTSA-57 is a rare example of a porous MOF whose structure consists of a polyhedral cage and one-dimensional open channel.(54, 55) Furthermore, UTSA-57a displays highly selective gas sorption for C2H2/CH4 at room temperature.Scheme 1. Organic Linker Mn(III)Cl-ttzppTop of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferences2 Experimental Section2.1Materials and MethodsAll general reagents and solvents were commercially available and were used as received. Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp was synthesized according to the reported literature method.(56) Caution: Sodium azide, which was used in the synthesis of the ligands, is very acutely toxic and potentially explosive. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern was recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation operated at 40 kV and 44 mA at a scan rate of 2.0\u00b0 min\u20131 at room temperature. 1H NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA 400 MHz spectrometer at room temperature. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 2100 Series II CHN/S analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min using a Shimadzu TGA-50 thermogravimetric analyzer. A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area analyzer was used to measure gas adsorption isotherms. The methanol-exchanged UTSA-57 was activated under a high vacuum at room temperature for 24 h until the outgas rate was <5 \u03bcmHg min\u20131 prior to measurements to generate the activated UTSA-57a. A sample of activated UTSA-57a was used for sorption measurements. The sorption measurements were performed at 77 K with liquid nitrogen, and the samples were kept at 196 K with a dry ice\u2013acetone slurry and at 273 K with an ice\u2013water bath. As the center-controlled air condition was set at 23 \u00b0C, a water bath was used for adsorption isotherms at 296 K.2.2{Mn(II)0.5[Mn(II)4Cl(Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp)2(H2O)4]}\u00b7(DEF)20\u00b7(CH3OH)18\u00b7(H2O)12 (UTSA-57)A mixture of MnCl2\u00b74H2O (0.03 g) and Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp (0.011 g) was dissolved in N,N\u2032-diethylformamide (DEF, 2 mL) and methanol (2 mL) in a 20 mL screw-capped vial. After 6 M HCl (8 \u03bcL) had been added to the mixture, the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 75 \u00b0C for 48 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the oven was cut off, leading to the separation of perfect brownish red crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction by filtration with a yield of 0.013 g, 51% [based on Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp ligand]. It was formulated as {Mn(II)0.5[Mn(II)4Cl(Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp)2(H2O)4]}\u00b7(DEF)20\u00b7(CH3OH)18\u00b7(H2O)12 based on elemental microanalysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, and the phase purity of the bulk material was independently confirmed by powder XRD (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

Found: C, 50.34; H, 7.30; N, 16.41.2.3Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction DeterminationX-ray diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation (\u03bb = 0.40663 \u00c5) at Advanced Photon Source on beamline 15ID-C. Indexing was performed using APEX2 (difference vectors method). Data integration and reduction were performed using SaintPlus 6.01. Absorption correction was performed by the multiscan method implemented in SADABS. The structure was solved using SHELXL-2014 (direct methods) and refined using SHELXL-2014 (full-matrix least-squares on F2). Despite using a synchrotron source and trying several crystals from different batches, diffraction experiments resulted in relatively low-quality diffraction data. This can be attributed to the presence of solvent disorder. All non-H atoms were found in the difference Fourier map and were refined using distance restraints. Restraints were also used to refine the anisotropic displacement parameters of the C, N, and O atoms. Hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions and included in the refinement process using the riding model with isotropic thermal parameters: Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C). The contribution of heavily disordered solvent molecules was treated as diffuse using the Squeeze procedure implemented in the PLATON program.

UTSA-57 crystallized in the tetragonal system and P4/mmm space group. As expected, UTSA-57 is based on cubic Mn4Cl(ttz)8-(H2O)4 clusters (Figure 1b) linked by square Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp ligands (Figure 1a). In the Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp ligand, the four tetrazole groups and their connecting phenyl rings are almost coplanar, whereas the porphyrin moiety and the phenyl rings are nearly perpendicular (calculated dihedral angle \u03b8 = 90.9\u00b0). In the Mn4Cl(ttz)8-(H2O)4 cluster, the Mn2+ ions of the chloride-centered square-planar {Mn4Cl}7+ units are connected through nitrogen atoms of tetrazolates from Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp ligands. Considering the four tetrazole groups of the Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp ligand as four-connecting nodes (Figure 1c) and the M4Cl(ttz)8-(H2O)4 clusters as eight-connecting nodes (Figure 1d), the overall structure of UTSA-57 adopts a very rare 4,8-c 2-nodal net with an scu-a topology (Schlafli symbol {44\u00b762}2{416\u00b7612}; Figure 1f).(57-63) In addition, UTSA-57 represents the first scu MOF that is built from 8-connected bridging SBUs. The resulting anionic framework in UTSA-57 is balanced by Mn2+ ions. It is noteworthy that, in UTSA-57, one type of polyhedral cage coexists with a one-dimensional nanotube. Such framework structures are very rare. The cage has an approximately ellipsoid cavity of ca. 11.9 \u00c5 diameter. Remarkably, the three-dimensional framework contains very large square one-dimensional open channels with a diameter as large as 20.3 \u00c5 along the c axis (Figure 1e). It should be noted that most of the scu-topology structures reported to date suffer from a significant degree of distortion. On the contrary, along the c axis, the porphyrin moieties are unprecedentedly parallel to each other. The calculated solvent-accessible volume of UTSA-57 is 75.1% by PLATON.(64)Figure 1. Portions of the crystal structure of UTSA-57: The four- and eight-connected nodes, represented by Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp4\u2013 and {Mn4Cl(tetrazolate)8} units, respectively, combine to form a three-dimensional structure with the scu topology. Solvent molecules and hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.The phase purity of the material was confirmed by elemental analysis and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Figure S2, Supporting Information). TGA of the as-synthesized UTSA-57 (Figure S3, Supporting Information) revealed a weight loss of 56% from 25 to \u223c240 \u00b0C for solvent molecules. The framework started to decompose at about 400 \u00b0C.To evaluate the permanent porosity of UTSA-57, we carried out gas sorption measurements on the activated UTSA-57 sample. A freshly prepared UTSA-57 sample was washed with DEF and anhydrous methanol several times and thermally activated at 80 \u00b0C under a dynamic vacuum before gas sorption measurements. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) isotherm of UTSA-57a shown in Figure 2a exhibits type I behavior, showing pore condensation with adsorption\u2013desorption hysteresis. This indicates the existence of micropores in UTSA-57a with a maximum N2 uptake of 137 cm3/g. UTSA-57a has a Langmuir surface area of 330.5 m2/g and a BET surface area of 206.5 m2/g. The CO2 gas sorption isotherm at 196 K (Figure S5, Supporting Information) further confirmed the permanent porous nature. The hydrogen capacity at normal pressure was assessed for UTSA-57a, with up to 1.0 wt % at 77 K (Figure 2b). The maximum adsorption of 1.9 wt % at 77 K can be predicted from the Langmuir\u2013Freundlich equation (R2 = 0.99957).Figure 2. (a) N2 and (b) H2 sorption isotherms of UTSA-57a at 77 K.We examined UTSA-57a for its potential application in gas separation. CO2, CH4, and C2H2 adsorption isotherms were collected at 273 and 296 K. As shown in Figure 3a, UTSA-57a takes up much less CH4 (15 cm3/g) at 273 K and 1 atm than CO2 (65 cm3/g) and C2H2 (57 cm3/g). Their adsorption isotherms at 296 K (Figure 3b) further confirmed the different gas uptakes of UTSA-57a for these examined gas molecules. The coverage-dependent adsorption enthalpies of UTSA-57a for CO2, C2H2, and CH4 were calculated based on the virial method from fits of their adsorption isotherms at 273 and 296 K (Figures S6\u2013S9, Supporting Information).(65) The enthalpies at zero coverage of gases were calculated to be 35.0, 37.2, 47.0, and 25.7 kJ/mol for C2H2, C2H4, CO2, and CH4, respectively. The adsorption enthalpies for C2H2, CO2, and CH4 in UTSA-57a are moderately higher than the reported values.(66) The relatively high Qst value of this compound might be due to open metal sites in the activated framework, which favors selective gas separation for these gas molecules.(67) The Henry\u2019s law selectivities (Sij) for C2H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4, which are moderately high,(68, 69) are also reported in Table S1 (Supporting Information).Figure 3. CO2, C2H2, CH4, and C2H4 sorption isotherms of UTSA-57a at (a) 273 and (b) 296 K.To establish the potential of UTSA-57a for gas separation, we applied ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations to evaluate their gas adsorption selectivities.(70) The mixture adsorption isotherms and selectivities at different temperatures and pressures calculated by the IAST for C2H2/CH4 (C2H2/CH4 = 50:50), C2H4/CH4 (C2H4/CH4 = 50:50), and CO2/CH4 (CO2/CH4 = 50:50) mixtures in this activated MOF as a function of total bulk pressure are shown in Figure 4 and Figures S10 and S11 (Supporting Information), respectively. As reported in Table S2 (Supporting Information), the IAST selectivities for C2H2/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and CO2/CH4 are 58.7, 40.3, and 28.0, respectively, at 273 K and 43.1, 25.7, and 20.0, respectively, at 296 K. The moderately high IAST selectivities established the potential of UTSA-57a for these gas separations. The IAST C2H2/CH4 separation selectivity of 58.7 at 296 K in UTSA-57a is relatively high and close to the reported value for UTSA-50a.(71)Figure 4.
