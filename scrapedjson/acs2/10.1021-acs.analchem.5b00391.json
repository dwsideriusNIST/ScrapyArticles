{"abstract": "Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous materials assembled from metal ions and organic linkers. Recently, many studies have been focused on the syntheses of MOFs with permanent porosity for various applications. However, no attention has been paid to controllable disassembly of MOFs and related applications. In this work, for the first time we synthesized novel tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)-functionalized MOFs (i.e., RuMOFs) that could be ion-responsively disassembled and release massive guest materials loaded in the frameworks. The synthesized RuMOFs exhibited much stability in aqueous solutions containing H, and many metal ions, but could be selectively and sensitively disassembled by Hg ions, resulting in the release of large quantities of Ru(bpy). The target-responsive release mechanism was investigated and discussed in detail. On the basis of the ion-responsive disassembly and release, an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence sensing method for Hg has been developed with a very low limit of detection (5.3 \u00d7 10 M). It was envisioned that the RuMOFs and similar target-responsive functional MOF materials would have promising applications in ultrasensitive and highly selective chemical sensing and even in accurately controllable drug delivering and releasing.", "text": "10.1021/acs.analchem.5b00391 Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous materials assembled from metal ions and organic ligands.(1) MOFs have attracted much attention due to their unique porosity, stability, and versatility.(2) Up until now, various MOFs for storing gases,(3, 4) loading catalysts,(5) separation,(6) and transporting and releasing drugs(7) have been synthesized and extensively studied since they have very promising applications in green energy industry, chemical engineering, and new biomedicine. Recently, syntheses and applications of functionalized MOFs for target sensing have become another hot topic in the research field of MOFs due to the unique properties of MOFs, such as high specific surface areas, size-controllable pores and apertures, abundant unsaturated open metal sites, and uncoordinated ends of linkers.(8)Among the synthesized MOFs for sensing purpose, luminescence-functionalized MOFs have attracted more and more attention for they may exhibit various and tunable optical properties and thus have promising applications as a new type of optical sensing materials.(9) Usually, most unfunctionalized MOFs can have intrinsic luminescence activities due to using aromatic linkers or lanthanide ions. However, their luminescence activities are not satisfying since most aromatic linkers do not contain large conjugated systems (i.e., fused aromatic rings) or metal-linker charge transfers are not significant (except for lanthanides-linkers), resulting in low detection sensitivity and thus limiting their sensing applications.Several efforts have been made to improve luminescence activities of MOFs by functionalizing MOFs, including the utilities of special linkers with high luminescence quantum yield,(9) and encapsulation luminescent guest molecules or nanoparticles.(10-12) The introduction of highly luminescent materials into MOFs while basically maintaining the original structures and properties of host MOFs has shown obvious improvements in both sensing selectivity and sensitivity. For example, encapsulation of highly fluorescent (FL, quantum yield >40%) carbon quantum dots in ZIF-8 has led to a significant increase (2 orders of magnitude improvement) in detection sensitivity for copper ions, compared with fluorescence sensor without MOFs.(12) However, there is still much room for improving the sensitivities of MOFs-based sensors. Up until now, most reported MOF sensors are based on luminescence quenching of lanthanide ions or aromatic fluorophores. The luminescence quenching (or signal off) transduction modes do not result in very low detection limits due to significant luminescence backgrounds. Additionally, the luminescence quenching events usually happen between one luminophore and one target, i.e., one point to one point interaction, thus it is difficult to amplify signal by raising the quantities of luminophores in MOFs. Therefore, design and synthesis luminescent MOFs that can be used for signal-on and signal-amplifying sensing of targets will be an important alternative for improving the sensitivities of MOF-based sensors.As well-known, MOFs are porous materials with very high specific surface areas, which enable them to contain large quantities of cargoes, such as drugs or luminophores. Apparently, the detection sensitivities of MOFs-based sensors would be greatly improved if large quantities of luminophores loaded in MOFs can be responsively released by small quantities of targets in an appropriate way. To reach this target-responsive release of luminophores from MOFs, the luminescence-functionalized MOFs should have following two properties: first, MOFs containing luminophores can maintain great stability in aqueous solutions in the absence of targets in order to get low optical background. Second, the release of large quantities of luminophores should be completed in a short time to obtain high sensitivity and fast response. Apparently, this is a challenging task in the design and synthesis of the desired MOFs since the good stability of luminescence-functionalized MOFs may conflict with easy release of guest luminophores from MOFs. Generally, if stable MOFs are used, it is difficult to release guest cargoes (luminophores or drugs) from the frameworks in short time. For example, MOFs have now been used for drug delivery and release, in which the drugs are slowly released over tens of hours, even several days.(7) Apparently, these types of MOFs with slow guest material release are unfit for sensing although they have shown promising applications in medicine.Recently, we have found a kind of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)-functionalized MOFs (RuMOFs) can serve as ideal signal-on and signal-amplifying sensing materials. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis, properties, and sensing applications of the RuMOFs. As shown in Scheme 1, the RuMOFs are assembled from adenine, zinc(II) salt, biphenyldicarboxylate (BPDC), and tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+). It should be noted here, Ru(bpy)32+ was selected as the guest molecules in MOFs since it is a versatile molecule that has many applications in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing,(13) biodiagnostics,(14) photovoltaics, and organic light-emitting diode.(15, 16) The main skeleton of the RuMOFs is bio-MOFs-1,(17-20) while the luminescent Ru(bpy)32+ is both doped in the frameworks (displacing BPDC) and encapsulated in the pores of MOFs. The luminescence-functionalized RuMOFs are very stable in aqueous solution but can be ion-selectively, rapidly, and completely disassembled by small quantities of mercury ions (Hg2+), resulting in the release of large quantities of luminescent guest materials, Ru(bpy)32+ cations, that give rise to strong fluorescence or electrochemiluminescence signals. On the basis of the novel RuMOF material, an ultrasensitive and highly selective chemical sensor for Hg2+, a highly toxic heavy metal ion often requiring assay,(21-23) has been developed, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.3 \u00d7 10\u201313 M. For the first time, stable luminescence-functionalized MOFs in aqueous solution can be target-responsively disassembled and release guest materials. It is envisioned that the RuMOFs and similar target-responsive functional MOF materials would have promising applications in ultrasensitive and highly selective chemical sensing and even in accurately controllable drug delivering and releasing.Scheme 1. Principle of the Synthesis of RuMOFs and Hg2+-Responsive Disassembly and ReleaseTop of PageAbstractExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesExperimental SectionChemicals and MaterialsTris (2, 2-bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate (Ru(bpy)3Cl2\u00b76H2O, >98%) and adenine (>99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. 4,4\u2032-Biphenyldicarboxylate (PBDC, >97%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) of analytical purity were from Tianjin Standard Science and Technology Co. (Tianjin, China). Other chemicals were of reagent grade unless otherwise noted. All chemicals were used without further purification.ApparatusThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TG209F1 thermal analysis system. All TGA experiments were performed under N2 atmosphere at temperature over 30\u2013800 \u00b0C with a temperature rising rate of 10 \u00b0C/min, and data were analyzed using TA Universal Analysis software package. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were taken using a Rigaku Miniflex X-ray diffractometer at 30 kV, 15 mA for Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) with scan speed of 0.1 s/step and a step size of 0.01\u00b0. TEM and SEM images were taken by a Tecnai G2 F20S-TWIN electronic microscope and a Nova NanoSEM 230 field-emission microscope, respectively. The specific surface areas of the products were measured by the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) method using nitrogen gas adsorption/desorption at 77 K (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2020). Cross-sectional confocal microscopic images were recorded on a laser confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon C2). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an F-4600 FL spectrofluorometer. The solid fluorescence was measured on a steady state and transient state fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920). ECL measurements were carried out on an EC&ECL detection system (MPI-E, Remex Electronic Instrument Lt. Co., Xi\u2019an, China) equipped with a glassy carbon (GC) working electrode (2.0 mm in diameter), a Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode, and a Pt wire counter electrode. In ECL measurements, TPrA (1.0 \u00d7 10\u20133 mol/L) was used as the coreactant, and the potential was cycled within the window from 0 V to +1.25 V, with a scan rate of 200 mV/s. An Agilent 7500 ICPMS system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to detect the Hg2+ concentration of the Min River water sample.Synthesis of Ru(bpy)32+-Functionalized bio-MOF-1 (RuMOFs)Typically, RuMOFs were prepared by adding adenine (0.25 mmol), 4,4\u2032-biphenyl dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) (0.5 mmol), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.75 mmol), tris(2,2\u2032-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) chloride hexahydrate (0.0145 mmol) in a mixed solvent of nitric acid (2 mmol), DMF (27 mL), and water (2 mL). The mixed solution was heated to 130 \u00b0C for 24 h, producing rod-shaped crystals. The crystals were collected, washed three times in turn with DMF and water, and finally dried by a vacuum oven at 70 \u00b0C for 2 h. The content of Ru(bpy)32+ in RuMOFs was controlled by adding various concentrations of Ru(bpy)32+ (from 0 to 1.25 mM) in the synthesis solution and calculated from the amount of Ru(bpy)32+ completely released from a certain weight of RuMOFs into pure water by Hg2+ (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). A constant content (3.64 wt %) of Ru(bpy)32+ in RuMOFs was reached when the concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ in the synthesis solution was 0.5 mM. Therefore, unless otherwise statement, RuMOFs were synthesized in DMF solution containing 0.5 mM Ru(bpy)32+.Top of PageAbstractExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesResults and DiscussionCharacterization of RuMOFsThe prepared RuMOF crystals are porous (see SEM images in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) and rod-shaped with length less than 100 \u03bcm and diameter less than 20 \u03bcm (see Figure 1A and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Under the excitation of UV or blue light, the whole RuMOFs rod emits strong red fluorescence (Figure 1B). The fluorescence spectrum measurements show that the RuMOFs have a maximum excitation wavelength and a maximum emission wavelength at 455 and 612 nm, respectively (Figure 1C). The fluorescence spectra of the RuMOFs are consistent with those of pure Ru(bpy)32+,(13, 14) indicating the MOFs have been well functionalized with Ru(bpy)32+. In order to confirm whether the luminopore Ru(bpy)32+ is homogeneously dispersed in the MOFs or just absorbed on the outmost surface, confocal microscopy was measured for the RuMOFs. The cross-sectional confocal microscopic images (Figure 1D) show that the red fluorescence emits from both the surface and inside of the MOF crystal, suggesting that Ru(bpy)32+ is indeed dispersed well in whole MOFs.Figure 1. (A) Bright filed microscopic image of RuMOFs. (B) Fluorescence microscopic image of RuMOFs. (C) Excitation (455 nm) and emission (612 nm) spectra of RuMOFs. (D) Cross-sectional confocal microscopic images of RuMOFs. (E) XRD data of bio-MOF-1 (black) and RuMOFs (red). (F) N2 adsorption isotherm for RuMOFs.The comparison of X-ray powder diffraction data of RuMOFs (see red line in Figure 1E) with that of their precursor MOFs (i.e., bio-MOF-1) (see black line in Figure 1E) indicates that the functionalization with Ru(bpy)32+ does not impact the crystalline integrity of bio-MOF-1. The BET isotherm of the RuMOFs (Figure 1F) shows a typical type-I isotherm characteristic of a microporous material, from which the BET surface area of the RuMOFs is found to be 424 m2/g, which is obviously lower than that the unfunctionalized MOFs (1388 m2/g, Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Additionally, TGA data (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) show that the thermal degradation process of RuMOFs is very similar to bio-MOF-1. There is a weight loss of 5.82% from room temperature to 125 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the loss of solvent guest molecules. Thereafter, a small weight loss (2.17% at 180 \u00b0C) prior to decomposition, which corresponds to the loss of dimethylammonium cations. Apparently, thermal stability of MOF does not change upon the functionalization with Ru(bpy)32+.Ion-Selective Triggered Disassembly and ReleaseIt is well-known that most MOFs can strongly adsorb some metal ions; however, unlike the classic MOFs, the RuMOF can be selectively decomposed by Hg2+ ions and release the luminorphore of Ru(bpy)32+ inside. As shown in Figure 2, the interactions between the RuMOFs and 17 commonly existing H+ and metal ions, including Hg2+, Li+, Na+, K+, NH4+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ were investigated. After adding 100 \u03bcM of above cations into water containing the same amount of the RuMOFs, only Hg2+ could trigger the release of the yellow component (i.e., Ru(bpy)32+) into the supernatant, whereas no release from the RuMOFs was found in pure water, acid solution (containing H+), or solutions of other metal ions. In addition to metal ions, the effects of some commonly existing anions, such as Cl\u2013, NO3\u2013, SO42\u2013, CO32\u2013, PO43\u2013, C2O42\u2013, CH3COO\u2013, SO32\u2013, S2\u2013, CN\u2013 (the counterions were all Na+) on the stability of RuMOFs were also investigated. No anion caused the release of Ru(bpy)32+ from the MOFs (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). Moreover, the interaction between methylmercury ion (CH3Hg+), an important organic mercury in environment, and RuMOFs was evaluated and compared with the inorganic of Hg2+ (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). It is evident that the organic mercury, CH3Hg+, does not cause any release of Ru(bpy)32+ from the RuMOFs. These experimental results show an extremely selective interaction between Hg2+ and the RuMOFs.Figure 2. Interactions between RuMOFs and various cations in water. Concentrations of the ions were all 100 \u03bcM. The counterions of the cations were all chlorine ion (Cl\u2013).The interaction between the RuMOFs and Hg2+ ion was further investigated in more detail. Before interaction with Hg2+, the RuMOFs are a kind of dark yellow powder (left cuvette in Figure 3A) and emit very bright red light under UV light (left cuvette in Figure 3B). The RuMOFs powder can remain very stable in water without Hg2+ for several months. However, after interaction with Hg2+ ions into water, yellow species can be released completely into the water phase (right cuvette in Figure 3A). The resultant yellow supernatant gives red light emission under UV (365 nm) light excitation (right cuvette in Figure 3B). The supernatant has a maximum FL emission at 620 nm (Figure 3C) and gives strong electrochemiluminescence signal in the presence of tripropylamine (TPrA) at potential higher than +1.0 V (Figure 3D), accompanied by a significant increase of oxidation current at +1.05 V (see inset of Figure 3D), which equals to the anodic peak potential of Ru(bpy)32+.(13) These results confirm that the yellow component released from the RuMOFs into water is Ru(bpy)32+. The Hg2+-triggered release of Ru(bpy)32+ was observed to be very rapid. The accurate release rate can be obtained by tracking the FL change on a single RuMOF crystal with the inverted FL microscope. Figure 4 shows that Hg2+-triggered release of Ru(bpy)32+ began at the surfaces of RuMOF crystals (Figure 4A,B), then propagated from outside to inside quickly (Figure 4B,C). During the release process, bright red light emitting crystals were displaced by dark blue FL objects (Figure 4D). The complete release of Ru(bpy)32+ could be finished within tens of seconds, depending the concentration of Hg2+, i.e., the higher Hg2+ concentration, the faster Ru(bpy)32+ release from the MOFs (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). It seems as if the morphology of the MOFs did not change during the fast release of Ru(bpy)32+ since their shapes are almost the same before (Figure 4A) and after (Figure 4D) the release. However, after a long time placing (more than 12 h), the compact MOF crystals deposited at the bottom of cuvette were changed to white floccular objects (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information), indicating the disassembly of RuMOFs or a significant change in morphology. The fast Hg2+-triggered release can be attributed to porous structure of MOFs, which facilitate the diffusion and interaction of Hg2+ and Ru(bpy)32+. It was found that a small amount of Hg2+ could trigger the release of a large amount of Ru(bpy)32+. Table S1 in the Supporting Information lists the concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ inductively released from RuMOFs by various concentrations of Hg2+. The data shows that the picomolar level of Hg2+ can trigger the release of the micromolar level of Ru(bpy)32+. The release efficiency, i.e., the molar ratio of Ru(bpy)32+ to Hg2+ was calculated to be in the range from \u223c103 to \u223c106. This means that one Hg2+ ion can inductively release thousands to millions of Ru(bpy)32+, depending on the concentration of Hg2+ used.Figure 3.

Fluorescence microscopic images obtained for the Hg2+-triggered release of Ru(bpy)32+ from RuMOF crystals. The images were recorded at (A) 0 s, (B) 10 s, (C) 20 s, and (D) 30 s after adding 10 \u03bcM Hg2+.Apparently, the Hg2+-triggered release of Ru(bpy)32+ from RuMOFs is not simply based on ion-exchange since the release efficiency via ion-exchange equilibrium should be less than 1. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the release of a large amount of Ru(bpy)32+ from RuMOFs is associated with the disassembly of RuMOF structure and complete release of Ru(bpy)32+ therein. The MOF disassembly hypothesis was confirmed by XRD, BET, TEM, and SEM experiments. XRD data show that the characteristic XRD peaks of MOFs (curve a in Figure 5A) completely disappear after the interaction of RuMOFs with Hg2+ (curve b in Figure 5A), an indication of destruction of RuMOFs. The XRD peaks of the resultant solid (i.e., after Ru(bpy)32+ release, curve b in Figure 5A) are the same as those of BPDC (curve c in Figure 5A), indicating that only one component of the MOFs, i.e., BPDC (low solubility in water), remains in the solid phase after disassembly of RuMOFs. BET data shows that resultant solid has very low BET surface area, only \u223c11 m2/g (curve b in Figure 5B), implying that the porous structure of MOFs with BET surface area of 424 m2/g (curve a in Figure 5B) is destroyed. TEM images show that the monolithic, uniform, and porous nanostructures of RuMOFs (Figure 5C) were changed into separated and nonuniform nanorods after the release of Ru(bpy)32+ (Figure 5D), an indication of significant morphology change in nanoscale. SEM should show that the regular micrometer-sized rod structure of RuMOFs (Figure 5E) completely collapsed into nanoparticles after the release of the guest molecules (Figure 5F). Apparently, the Hg2+-triggered disassembly of RuMOF structures results in the release of water-soluble components including Ru(bpy)32+, adenine, and Zn2+ into the water phase and leaving the water-insoluble BPDC in the solid phase.Figure 5. (A) XRPD data of RuMOFs (a), Hg2+-RuMOFs (b), and BPDC (c); (B) N2 adsorption isotherm for RuMOFs (a) and Hg2+-RuMOFs (b); (C) TEM images of RuMOFs; (D) TEM images of Hg2+-RuMOFs; (E) SEM images of RuMOFs; (F) SEM images of Hg2+-RuMOFs. The samples for TEM analysis were ground into smaller particles for electron beam transparency.Mechanism of Disassembly and ReleaseIt is interesting to understand why small quantities of Hg2+ ions can trigger the complete disassembly of RuMOFs and the release of large quantities of Ru(bpy)32+. In structure, the RuMOFs have the same frameworks as their precursor bio-MOF-1 (proved by the XRD data), which means that the basis frameworks does not change upon the Ru(II) functionalization. However, the BET surface area of RuMOFs is 424 m2/g, which is significantly lower than that of bio-MOF-1 (1388 m2/g). This means the pores of MOFs are occupied by some Ru(bpy)32+ ions. Moreover, RuMOFs rapidly collapse in the presence of Hg2+ ions (as shown in Figure 4), whereas the bare MOFs (i.e., bio-MOF-1) are very stable upon exposure to Hg2+.This suggests that Ru(bpy)32+ ions not only occupy pores of the MOFs but also dope the frameworks, most likely at the sites of BPDC due to their similarity in molecular size. Apparently, the dopant Ru(bpy)32+ at the frameworks cannot link zinc-adenine columns as BPDC does, since all active sites (N atoms) of the bipyridines in Ru(bpy)32+ combine the central metal ion, Ru(II), thus there is no direct bonding between the bipyridine of Ru(bpy)32+ and the zinc-adenine columns. However, Ru(bpy)32+ can be immobilized at the frameworks via electrostatic interactions between positively charged Ru(bpy)32+ ions and negatively charged MOFs.(19) When Hg2+ is added into the solution, it can be strongly and selectively complexed by the adenine(24-26) and thus increase positive charges near Ru(bpy)32+, which may remove Ru(bpy)32+ from the framework by electrostatic repulsion. Subsequently, the removal of the large species (i.e., Ru(bpy)32+ ions) lead to the collapse of the MOFs and release large quantities of Ru(bpy)32+ in the adjacent pores. The disassembly of outside layer of RuMOFs exposes the inner part to Hg2+ and causes further collapse of the inner framework until the RuMOFs are completely decomposed (Figure 6). Other metal ions, such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+ and so on, might have much weaker complexation with adenine than Hg2+,(24) thus their weak ion exchanges with Ru(bpy)32+ at low metal ion concentrations (e.g., less than 100 \u03bcM as shown in Figure 2) could not be enhanced by the way of metal ion-adenine complexation and could not cause the collapse of RuMOFs.Figure 6. Mechanism proposed for Hg2+-responsive disassembly of RuMOFs and release of the guest material of Ru(bpy)32+.Sensing ApplicationsThe excellent ion-selective, facile disassembly, and effective release property of RuMOFs may enable the development of signal-on and signal-amplifying sensing method for the detection of ultratrace Hg2+ ions. The excellent selectivity (as indicated by Figure 2) makes it possible to sense Hg2+ in the presence of large quantities of other metal ions without using any separation techniques or masking reagents. The large release efficiencies (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), i.e., each Hg2+ inducing the release of 103\u2013106 Ru(bpy)32+ ions, combined with the sensitive fluorescence and electrochemiluminescence detection (Figures S9 and S10 in the Supporting Information) abilities for Ru(bpy)32+,(13, 14) makes it possible to detect ultratrace Hg2+ (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). In practice, the fluorescence sensor for Hg2+ based on the RuMOFs functional material works well when the concentration of Hg2+ is in the range from 25 pM to 50 nM, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.2 pM; while the electrochemiluminescence sensor for Hg2+ based on the same RuMOFs is validated in the Hg2+ concentration range from 1 to 100 pM, with a LOD of 0.53 pM. The LODs are much lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandate of 2 ppb (10 nM) for Hg(II).(23) These LODs also suggest that the fluorescence and electrochemiluminesccence sensors based on RuMOFs are one of the most sensitive optical sensors for Hg2+, at least 3 to 4 orders of magnitude better than those of previously reported optical detection methods (usually with LODs of nanomolar levels).(27-29) The applicability of this sensing system for detecting Hg2+ in a real sample was further evaluated. We applied a standard working curve method to detect the concentration of Hg2+ in the sample of Min River (the largest river in Fujian Province, China). The concentration of Hg2+ ions in the Min River sample (n = 11) detected using this new approach was 2.49 \u00b1 0.075 nM; this value is consistent with the result obtained by the ICPMS method, namely, 2.46 \u00b1 0.059 nM. These results confirm the validity of this sensing method for the detection of Hg2+ in real samples.Top of PageAbstractExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesConclusionsFor the first time we synthesized novel luminescence-functionalized MOFs (i.e., RuMOFs) that could be ion-responsively disassembled and release large quantities of luminescent guest materials. In the RuMOFs, the important luminescent cathodic molecules, i.e., Ru(bpy)32+, were both encapsulated in the pores and doped in the frameworks. In aqueous solutions, the RuMOFs were very stable but can be selectively and sensitively disassembled by Hg2+ ions, leading to the release of large quantities of Ru(bpy)32+. The ion-responsive disassembly and release has been proposed to follow the mechanism: certain amounts of Ru(bpy)32+ molecules are doped in the frameworks by displacing the BPDC linkers with the similar molecular diameter, while other Ru(bpy)32+ molecules are encapsulated in the pores of MOFs. Upon exposure to Hg2+, the water-soluble cathodic Ru(bpy)32+ molecules are selectively exchanged into aqueous solution, leading to the collapse of the frameworks and release of large quantities of Ru(bpy)32+ in the pores of MOFs. One Hg2+ can triggered the release of \u223c103 to \u223c106 Ru(bpy)32+ molecules. On the basis of the ion-responsive release, an ultrasensitive sensing method for Hg2+ has been developed with a very low LOD (5.3 \u00d7 10\u201313 M). It can be envisioned that the RuMOFs and similar target-responsive functional MOF materials would have promising applications in ultrasensitive and highly selective chemical sensing and even in accurately controllable drug delivering and releasing.
