Recently, MOFs have received considerable attention for various separation, catalysis, and gas storage applications.(1, 2) A significant fraction of MOF studies have been focused on the adsorption of small molecules such as H2,(3) methane,(4, 5) and CO2,(6) though a number of other separations have been explored.(7)Hydrocarbon separations are of considerable importance in the chemical industry, and many MOFs have been studied using both experimental and computational techniques.(8) For instance, open metal site MOFs such as HKUST-1(9-11) and MOF-74(12, 13) show preferential adsorption of olefins over paraffins for both long-(14, 15) and short-chain(16) hydrocarbons. This selectivity is primarily attributed to the strong interaction of the unsaturated metal center with the olefin double bond.(10, 12) Another interesting separation that has been widely studied using MOFs is the removal of p-xylene from a mixture of C8 alkyl aromatics.(17-19) The most commonly reported MOFs used for this application include the MIL-47 and MIL-53 series, which show the selective adsorption of p-xylene.(20, 21) In contrast to the adsorption mechanism in open metal site MOFs, the selectivity in MIL-47 is due to entropic effects.(22) A number of MOF materials have been studied for various other hydrocarbon separations, as summarized in a recent review by Herm et al.(8)The ordered crystalline structure of MOFs makes them amenable to computational studies for predicting adsorption properties. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations have been used to calculate adsorption isotherms for various small molecules using generic force fields. For example, this approach has been employed for the high-throughput screening of MOFs for CO2 capture(23) and methane storage(5) applications. Generic force fields such as DREIDING(24) and the universal force field (UFF)(25) are straightforward to implement and give reasonable results for simple systems.A limitation of generic force fields is their suitability for systems that involve specific interactions.(26) For example, because of the presence of open metal sites, UFF and DREIDING fail at predicting the adsorption of CO2 in the MOF-74 series.(27, 28) Similarly, the adsorption of olefins in HKUST-1 cannot be well described by traditional approaches.(29-31) These observations suggest that due to the large diversity of available MOFs and functional groups, generic force fields may not always be suitable for describing complex MOF/adsorbate interactions.(32)One approach that is gaining in popularity is to use force fields that have been developed from quantum chemical calculations to model interactions of nanoporous materials.(33-36) A recent review from Fang et al.(32) provides a summary of the work in this area. Multiple groups have developed ab initio force fields for H2,(37, 38) CO2,(27, 28, 39-41) CH4,(42) and H2O(26) in MOFs using cluster calculations at various levels of theory. These methods involve calculating single-point energies for a variety of adsorbate configurations with a representative MOF cluster to obtain the force field parameters. An important factor that determines the accuracy of the force field is the level of theory used for the interaction energy calculations. Examples of high-quality quantum chemical methods that have been used include coupled cluster (CCSD(T)/CBS),(43) second-order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset (MP2),(27, 44) and symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT).(45, 46) Because of the high computational cost associated with these methods, their applicability is restricted to smaller clusters and a limited number of adsorbate configurations.(28, 32) A reasonable trade-off between computational cost and accuracy in many circumstances is provided by density functional theory (DFT).In related work on hydrocarbon adsorption, one focus has been on modeling olefin interactions in HKUST-1. Fischer et al.(10, 47) used DFT calculations (using the PBE functional(48)) to model the adsorption of propylene in HKUST-1. A representative cluster of the MOF was used to probe configurations of propylene that allow for the interaction of the double bond with the Cu atom. The potential energy surface was fitted to a functional form that was used to calculate the adsorption isotherms. The predicted results were in good agreement with experimental measurements, indicating that DFT was sufficiently accurate to model adsorption in this system.(10) Similarly, a cluster-based approach was used by Amirjalayar et al.(49) to study the adsorption of benenze in MOF-5 using MM3-type potentials for fitting.(50, 51)Most of the MOF force field development literature has used cluster calculations to model the interactions of the adsorbate with the framework. An inherent assumption in this approach is that the force field that has been fitted to a representative cluster is transferable to the periodic framework. This assumption can be tested by systematically increasing the size of the cluster,(10, 27) but is computationally impractical for large clusters and higher-order methods. The cluster approach does not account for the long-ranged interactions that may exist in the extended structure during the force field fitting step. For instance, the simple cutoff scheme used by Fischer et al.(10) resulted in an artificial enhancement of interaction energy and had to be rectified.(30, 52) Similarly, an MP2-derived force field(27) correctly predicted the CO2 adsorption isotherms in Mg MOF-74 but was unable to predict the experimental binding geometries.(28)An alternate approach that avoids these issues is to use periodic calculations to develop the force field. Compared to MP2 calculations with moderately sized clusters, a periodic DFT calculation is generally less computationally expensive. This approach has been used by Fang et al.(53, 54) to model the adsorption of CO2 in zeolites using periodic DFT calculations. Hundreds of randomly generated CO2 configurations in Si-CHA were used to calculate the interaction energies using PBE/D2 DFT calculations. This approach was recently extended to Na+-exchanged zeolites using the more accurate DFT/CC method.(55) The DFT/CC method corrects the DFT energies by using a pretabulated correction curve that is derived from (cluster-based) CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.(56) The resulting DFT/CC-derived force fields for CO2 accurately predict experimental adsorption isotherms and are transferrable across different Si/Al ratios and zeolite topologies.(53) A similar approach has been employed by Zang et al.(26) to describe the interaction of water with HKUST-1 using randomly generated water configurations. A simple scaling of a Lennard-Jones potential was found to be unsuitable, and an alternate empirical functional form was required to correctly match the PBE-D2 energies. Chen et al.(41) have performed DFT/CC calculations for CH4 adsorption in the periodic HKUST-1 framework. The potential energy surface was fit to a complicated functional form, and good agreement with experimental methane adsorption was observed. The resulting force field was transferrable to another MOF, PCN-14, which has the same chemical composition as HKUST-1 but different topology.(41) More recently, Lin et al.(28) have used a periodic model of MOF-74 to derive force fields for CO2 and H2O adsorption using DFT calculations with the vdW-DF2(57) functional. Similar to their previous work,(27) the authors identify a set of adsorbate orientations that maximize a given pairwise interaction and reduce the number of required energy calculations. The predicted CO2 and H2O adsorption and transport properties are in good agreement with experiments.The results summarized above indicate that periodic calculations at the DFT level can be used to derive transferable force fields in MOFs at a reasonable computational cost. Most of the literature on ab initio force field development for MOFs has been focused on modeling interactions of open metal sites with small molecules (CO2, H2O) or with olefins.(32) The limited number of computational studies for long hydrocarbons use off-the-shelf force fields such as DREIDING or UFF to model the MOF framework.(58-60) Even though the predicted isotherms may be in reasonable agreement with experiments, the accuracy of the generic force fields in modeling the interactions is unclear. To the best of our knowledge, first-principles-derived force fields for long-chain paraffin and olefins have not been reported for MOFs.In this work, we propose a general methodology for obtaining force fields for long-chain flexible adsorbates in MOFs using periodic DFT calculations. Of the MOFs that have been studied for alkane adsorption, reliable experimental data is available for MIL-47(V) and the MIL-53 series.(58, 59) To avoid complications associated with the framework flexibility of the MIL-53 series,(61-63) we choose MIL-47(V) as our model system for force field development.The article is organized as follows. In section 2, a brief overview of our algorithm and the computational methods is presented. Sections 3 and 4 describe the development and application of our force fields for predicting the adsorption and diffusion of alkanes in MIL-47(V). A brief extension of our approach to modeling olefins is presented in section 5. Finally, in section 6, we evaluate the transferability of the force field to MIL-53(Cr) and study the guest-induced structure transitions of MIL-53(Fe).Top of PageAbstractIntroductionForce Field Development AlgorithmModeling Alkane Adsorption in MIL-47(V)Diffusion of Alkanes in MIL-47(V)Force Field Development for AlkenesForce Field Transferability to the MIL-53 SeriesSummaryReferences2 Force Field Development Algorithm2.1OverviewThe goal of our force field development strategy is to ensure that the force field parameters reproduce the DFT energy for various configurations of the adsorbates in MIL-47(V). Briefly, this is done by generating a number of configurations from an initial generic force field, calculating the DFT interaction energies for these configurations in the periodic system, and fitting a classical force field to the DFT data to obtain the new force field. Next, this new force field is used to generate another set of adsorbate configurations, and this process is repeated until sufficient convergence of the force field parameters is obtained.2.2Structure OptimizationThe structure for MIL-47(V) was obtained from the literature(64) and was fully optimized using DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The GGA functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof(65) was used with Grimme\u2019s D2(48) corrections to include dispersion interactions with the PAW method.(66) The lattice constants were optimized at a plane wave cutoff of 700 eV, while the internal coordinates were energy minimized at a 400 eV cutoff. All single-point DFT calculations were performed at the \u0393 point to reduce computational cost. The DFT-optimized lattice constants give good agreement with the experimental data (Table S1). Compared to the MIL-53 series of materials, MIL-47(V) is known to be relatively nonflexible, and our DFT calculations assume the framework to be rigid.(59)2.3Initial Configurations and DFT Interaction EnergyFor a force field to be well suited to predicting adsorption, it is essential to describe the energetics of the relevant low-energy adsorbate configurations accurately. One approach is to generate hundreds of adsorbate configurations randomly for single-point energy calculations.(53, 54) For extended molecules such as linear C3\u2013C9 hydrocarbons, this approach is not straightforward as the adsorbate molecules are flexible. Additionally, it is likely that only a small fraction of randomly generated configurations will be energetically favorable. Instead, we performed configurational bias Monte Carlo (CBMC)(67) using an initial force field to obtain candidate low-energy adsorbate configurations at P/P0 = 0.1 and 303 K. Specifically, we use the generic DREIDING force field(24) and Lorentz\u2013Berthelot mixing rules to obtain the preliminary set of hydrocarbon configurations, which has been shown to reasonably predict hydrocarbon adsorption in MIL-47 (V).(58)The hydrocarbons are modeled as flexible molecules using the united atom TraPPE force field.(68) In the TraPPE description of hydrocarbons, no charges are assigned to the united atoms and the intermolecular interactions are described by a simple Lennard-Jones potential. To be consistent with the TraPPE force field, the pairwise interactions of the adsorbates with the MOFs are modeled using only van der Waals terms. Details of the fluid\u2013fluid interaction model, DREIDING parameters, and atom types for MIL-47(V) are provided in Table S2.The interaction energy of the adsorbate molecules with the framework is defined as(1)where EMOF and Eads refer to the DFT energies of the empty MIL-47(V) framework and the hydrocarbon molecule, respectively, while EMOF+ads is the DFT energy of the combined system. Typically, we use 300\u2013600 adsorbate configurations to derive a set of force field parameters. Note that only united atom positions are obtained from CBMC snapshots. Thus, hydrogen atoms must be correctly added to carbon chains prior to the DFT calculation. The structural constraints used during this step are summarized in Table S3. The length of a linear C6 hydrocarbon (\u223c6.3 \u00c5) is comparable to the unit cell size along the a axis of MIL-47(V), so DFT calculations with a 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 unit cell may cause overlap of the adsorbate with its own periodic image. Thus, all of the DFT single-point energy (SPE) calculations are performed using a 144 atom, 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 supercell of MIL-47(V) with reciprocal space sampled at the \u0393 point.The interaction of hydrocarbons with MIL-47(V) is dominated by dispersion interactions, and a DFT method that accounts for these interactions is required. Because the goal of this work is to develop force fields that are consistent with a given DFT method, we use two different DFT methods, PBE-D2(48) and vdW-DF2,(57) for our calculations.2.4Parameter Fitting and Functional FormsThe DFT energies obtained from CBMC configurations are fit to a chosen potential form of a force field in a least-squares sense. Specifically, we consider two functional forms, namely, the Lennard-Jones (LJ)(2)and the Buckingham potential(3)Compared to the two-parameter (\u03b5 and \u03c3) LJ potential, the Buckingham potential has three parameters (p0, p1, and p2) and should therefore fit the underlying data better. For the LJ potential, two types of parameter fits were attempted. In the first case, we fix the \u03c3 parameter to the value given by Lorentz\u2013Berthelot mixing rules (DREIDING + TraPPE) and vary only the \u03b5 parameter during the fitting procedure. In the second fitting procedure, we allow both the \u03b5 and \u03c3 of each interacting pair to vary. All of the parameter fitting calculations were implemented in MATLAB.2.5Adsorption Isotherms and Convergence of Force Field ParametersThe newly fitted force field parameters were used for the calculation of adsorption isotherms using configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) as implemented in the RASPA simulation code.(69) A spherical cutoff of 13.0 \u00c5 was used for the pairwise interaction potentials. The CBMC calculations were equilibrated using at least 100\u202f000 cycles. Production runs of 400\u202f000 cycles were used for measuring macroscopic properties.The first iteration of the FF parameters is obtained by fitting the configurations obtained from a generic force field. Even though interaction energies are calculated using DFT, they may not be well converged with respect to the DFT method after a single iteration. To ensure convergence, we obtained configurations from the new force field and repeated the steps described above in sections 2.3\u20132.5 to obtain the next iteration of the FF parameters. At each step, the configurations from all of the previous iterations are used for fitting. As we show later, typically two iterations are sufficient to obtain well-converged FF parameters and adsorption isotherms.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionForce Field Development AlgorithmModeling Alkane Adsorption in MIL-47(V)Diffusion of Alkanes in MIL-47(V)Force Field Development for AlkenesForce Field Transferability to the MIL-53 SeriesSummaryReferences3 Modeling Alkane Adsorption in MIL-47(V)3.1Comparison of DREIDING FF with the PBE-D2 MethodBefore moving to the FF development of ethane, it is useful to compare the energies of the generic DREIDING FF with the PBE-D2 DFT method for long hydrocarbons. We obtained adsorption isotherms and CBMC configurations for several C5 alkane and alkene isomers using the DREIDING FF. Figure 1 compares the PBE-D2 and DREIDING interaction energies for 100 configurations of pentane, 1-pentene, and trans-2-pentene in MIL-47(V). The mean absolute deviations (MADs) for the alkenes (3.6 and 5.6 kJ/mol) are significantly higher than for pentane (2.6 kJ/mol). The DREIDING interaction energies for trans-2-pentene show a systematic underprediction for low-energy configurations. This indicates that the DREIDING FF is not consistent with PBE-D2 and that a FF can be developed to better reproduce the DFT energies.Figure 1. Interaction energies for 100 configurations of pentane (red squares), 1-pentene (green circles), and trans-2-pentene (blue triangles) using DREIDING FF and PBE-D2 in MIL-47(V).3.2Force Field Development for Ethane3.2.1Method OverviewWe now move to modeling the adsorption of ethane in MIL-47(V) using our force field algorithm. As summarized in section 2.3, we use a generic force field to obtain the initial set of configurations for DFT calculations. Figure 2 shows the PBE-D2 interaction energies (blue triangles) for 200 configurations obtained from the DREIDING FF. Compared to PBE-D2, the DREIDING FF overpredicts adsorption energies by \u223c3 kJ/mol with a MAD of 2.5 kJ/mol. To make our classical FF consistent with PBE-D2, we fit the \u03b5 parameter for each LJ interaction pair (four element types in all) using least-squares fitting and recalculate the interaction energies with the new force field (denoted as FITTED_LJ). In this case, the \u03c3 values were held constant. By definition, the interaction energies calculated with FITTED_LJ (Figure 2, red circles) show much better agreement with PBE-D2 than the results from the DREIDING FF. The MAD is reduced to \u223c1.3 kJ/mol with a mean deviation (MD) of 0.03 kJ/mol.Figure 2. PBE-D2 interaction energies for 200 configurations of ethane in MIL-47(V) compared to generic DREIDING FF (blue triangles) and FITTED_LJ FF (red circles).3.2.2Convergence of FF ParametersThe force field parameters obtained after one iteration are presented in Table S4. To ensure that the new FF (FITTED_LJ) reproduces the PBE-D2 data consistently, we performed CBMC again with the new FF and obtained 200 additional ethane configurations. These configurations were used to calculate PBE-D2 interaction energies and to reparametrize the FF by fitting the \u03b5 values. Table S4 presents the evolution of the force field parameters for three such iterations and shows that the fitted FF parameters do not change significantly after two iterations. At each FF iteration, all of the configurations from the previous iterations are included during the fitting procedure. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis presented in the Supporting Information, we find that the fitting results and isotherms are essentially insensitive to the vanadium FF parameters. This is not surprising as the V atom is octahedrally coordinated and does not directly interact with the adsorbates. Thus, the \u03b5 value for V is set to zero for all further calculations.The convergence of the FF parameters is further confirmed by comparing the adsorption isotherms for various FF iterations in Figure 3. The adsorption isotherms for iterations 1\u20133 do not differ significantly but are all lower than the original DREIDING force field. The ethane force field is now consistent with PBE-D2 and is henceforth referred to as PBE-D2 FF. For all of the results presented in this work, at least two force field iterations were used to guarantee good convergence of the parameters.Figure 3. Ethane adsorption isotherms in MIL-47(V) at 303 K using three iterations of the DFT-derived FF. The isotherm from the DREIDING FF is also shown for comparison.3.2.3Choice of Classical Potential FormIn the previous section, we have shown that our approach can be used to develop force fields that can reproduce DFT energies in MIL-47(V) for a large number of configurations. We now turn to exploring the potential form used for fitting the data. The MIL-47(V) framework consists of four types of elements: C, H, O, and V. The ethane molecule is represented by the CH3 united atom, resulting in four distinct pairwise interactions. Earlier, we used an LJ potential form and allowed only the four \u03b5 values to vary during the least-squares fitting. Figure 4 shows the fitting results when the four \u03c3 values are also allowed to change, leading to a total of eight fitting parameters for the system (blue triangles). Similarly, we can use a Buckingham potential for each interacting pair, resulting in 12 total parameters (Figure 4, green squares). The fitted parameters using these two potentials are reported in Table S6.The MAD using 4 LJ parameters is reduced from 1.3 to 1.2 kJ/mol (1.1 kJ/mol) when 8 LJ parameters (12 Buckingham parameters) are used. Even though there is slight improvement in the quality of the fit by using more parameters, the final converged adsorption isotherms (Figure S1) are not significantly different for various functional forms of the force field. To simplify the implementation of our DFT-derived FFs, we choose the four-parameter LJ model for all further calculations. The converged PBE-D2 FF parameters for ethane obtained by using 600 PBE-D2 calculations and fitted to a four-parameter LJ potential form are presented in Table 1.Figure 4. Comparison of the fitted FF interaction energies with PBE-D2 for different potential functional forms: LJ, 4 parameters (red circles); LJ, 8 parameters (blue triangles); and Buckingham, 12 parameters (green squares).3.2.4Choice of DFT MethodWe now discuss the FF development using DFT calculations with the vdW-DF2 functional (denoted as VDW-DF2 FF), which will be compared with the previous PBE-D2 FF. Figure 5 shows the PBE-D2, vdW-DF2, and DREIDING energies for 200 configurations of ethane in MIL-47(V) MOF. The data has been arranged according to increasing PBE-D2 interaction energies. For the most favorable configurations, the average vdW-DF2 interaction energy (\u221229 kJ/mol) is more negative than the PBE-D2 (\u221226 kJ/mol) result. Coincidentally, for these configurations, the DREIDING energies (\u221225 kJ/mol) are comparable to the PBE-D2 energies. As we move toward the less favorable configurations (toward the right in Figure 5), the difference between the two DFT methods diminishes to zero at approximately \u221217 kJ/mol. For DFT interaction energies less negative than \u221217 kJ/mol, DREIDING FF overestimates the ethane-framework interactions relative to the DFT results.Figure 5. Interaction energies for 200 configurations of ethane in MIL-47(V) calculated using PBE-D2 (black, solid line), vdW-DF2 (red, dotted line), and DREIDING FF (blue, dotted line). The moving average for vdW-DF2 (red, solid line) and DREIDING FF (blue, solid line) is calculated using five configurations for each data point.Similar calculations as before were performed using vdW-DF2, and the final VDW-DF2 FF is obtained after three FF fitting iterations. Figure S2 shows the comparison of the vdW-DF2 interaction energies with the fitted force field for 600 ethane configurations. The MAD for the vdW-DF2-derived force field is slightly higher (2.1 kJ/mol) compared to the PBE-D2 (1.3 kJ/mol) version.Table 1 compares the final converged ethane force fields developed using the PBE-D2 and vdW-DF2 methods with the original DREIDING FF. It is interesting that \u03b5(C\u2013CH3) for DREIDING and VDW-DF2 FF are close to each other and are \u223c10 K higher than the PBE-D2 FF. More importantly, both the DFT force fields predict a higher \u03b5(O\u2013CH3) than the DREIDING FF, indicating that increasing the O\u2013CH3 interaction by 55% (40%) relative to the DREIDING value is necessary to better reproduce the PBE-D2 (vdW-DF2) interaction energy.Table 1.

One way of resolving this issue is to compare the simulated adsorption isotherms with experimental data. Figure 6 compares the predicted ethane adsorption isotherms using DREIDING, PBE-D2 FF, and VDW-DF2 FF with the experimental data from Rosenbach et al.(59) at 303 K. Consistent with our predictions in section 3.2.4, the PBE-D2 FF isotherms are indeed lower than the VDW-DF2 FF and DREIDING values. Additionally, because of the similar average interaction energies, the predicted uptakes from VDW-DF2 FF and DREIDING FF are comparable.Figure 6. Ethane adsorption isotherms in MIL-47(V) using the PBE-D2, vdW-DF2, and DREIDING FFs. The simulation data is compared to the scaled (dashed line) and unscaled (solid line) experimental data from Rosenbach et al.(59)Before comparing the DFT FF predictions with the experimental isotherms, it is useful to discuss the quality of the MOF sample used in the adsorption experiments.(59) The measured surface area for the MIL-47(V) sample (1200 m2/g) was significantly smaller than the calculated geometrically accessible surface area (1540 m2/g), and the authors suggest scaling up the experimental isotherms by \u223c28% for comparison with simulations.(59) In this case, the low surface area of MIL-47(V) was attributed to an incomplete removal of terephthalic acid from the pores during the activation.(59) Similar to this approach, other groups have employed pore volumes to derive the necessary scaling factors.(47, 52)With regard to measuring the BET surface area, Snurr and coworkers(70, 71) have highlighted the importance of using an appropriate pressure range for the calculation.(72) They conclude that BET calculations over the standard pressure range (0.05 < P/P0 < 0.3) may underestimate the true value. Given the nuances associated with the measurement of BET surface areas and the activation process, simply scaling up the experimental adsorption isotherm by almost 30% to compare with calculated data is less than optimal.To explain this further, instead of considering the BET surface area as one number, we introduce error bars into this measurement and calculate the bounds on the scaling factors necessary to match the perfect sample. This is summarized in Table 2 and Table S7. If the error bar for a given BET measurement is less than \u00b15%, then a scale up of anywhere between 22 and 35% is necessary. If the error bar is now increased to \u00b110%, then the scaling factor range increases to 27\u201343%. This calculation indicates that scaling adsorption isotherms for samples that are reported to have low BET surface areas compared to ideal theoretical values may lead to large uncertainties, depending on the accuracy of the BET calculation.Table 2. Scaling Factors for Different Hypothetical Error Bars in the Measured BET Surface Areaa% error inBETmeasurementscaling factorrange01.28<\u00b151.22\u20131.35<\u00b1101.17\u20131.43<\u00b1151.12\u20131.51aThe baseline surface areas for the experimental and \u201cperfect\u201d samples are 1200 and 1540 m2/g, respectively.For situations in which the adsorption data has not been reproducibly reported by multiple groups, we choose to compare our simulated results with both the scaled and unscaled experimental isotherms. Figure 6 shows that the predicted adsorption isotherms from the two DFT methods, along with the DREIDING force field, lie in between the two experimental curves.Although viewing the experimental data in this way does not indicate that any of the three FFs give implausible results, we cannot draw a clear conclusion about the suitability of the DFT-derived force fields based only on this ethane adsorption data. Nonetheless, as we will show in the following sections, we are able to extend our method to higher alkanes, and this allows us to compare our results to more reliable experimental adsorption measurements.3.3Force Field for PropaneFrom the ethane calculations above, we now have force field parameters that describe the interaction of the CH3_sp3_UA group with the MOF framework. As shown in Figure 7, propane molecules consist of two CH3_sp3_UA interaction centers and one CH2_sp3_UA interaction center. Similarly, within TraPPE, a hexane molecule is described by two CH3_sp3_UA and four CH2_sp3_UA interaction centers. To model the adsorption of higher linear alkanes, we need to correctly model the interaction of the CH2_sp3_UA site with the MIL-47(V) framework atoms.Figure 7. Description of linear alkanes using the TraPPE united atom model consisting of CH3_sp3_UA (gray) and CH2_sp3_UA (blue) interaction sites. The hydrogen atoms (white) have been shown for clarity and are not explicitly defined in the TraPPE force field. Each number in parentheses indicates the number of interaction sites of each type.This is achieved by repeating the FF development algorithm for propane using the PBE-D2 and vdW-DF2 methods. Figure 8 shows the results of fitting propane interactions with the framework for PBE-D2 and vdW-DF2 methods. To make the force field transferable across different linear alkanes, we allow only the CH2_sp3_UA interaction parameters to vary during the parameter fitting, while the CH3_sp3_UA parameters from our ethane results (Table 1) are held constant. Similar to the ethane calculations, the LJ potential form with four \u03b5 parameters was used for fitting. Starting with an initial set of 600 configurations used for the fitting, we considered 600 additional configurations to confirm the convergence of the FF parameters. The final mean absolute deviations for PBE-D2 FF and VDW-DF2 FF are 1.6 and 2.1 kJ/mol after two force field iterations, showing that the optimized force fields successfully reproduce the DFT energies.To test if fixing the CH3_sp3_UA interactions introduces a fitting bias, we considered a situation where both CH3_sp3_UA and CH2_sp3_UA parameters were optimized during the propane fitting procedure. We find that the CH3_sp3_UA parameters do not change significantly from the ethane values and essentially identical adsorption isotherms are obtained (data not shown). This indicates that the interaction parameters obtained for CH3_sp3_UA and CH2_sp2_UA are transferable across different adsorabtes that belong to the same homologous series.Figure 8. Force field fitting results for the adsorption of propane in MIL-47(V) using (a) PBE-D2 and (b) vdW-DF2 DFT energies. In each case, 1200 adsorbate configurations were used. Only the CH2_sp3_UA interaction parameters were allowed to vary, while the CH3_sp3_UA parameters were obtained from the ethane results in Table 1.A comparison of the two DFT methods for 600 propane configurations in MIL-47(V) is presented in Figure S3. Consistent with our previous ethane results, the vdW-DF2 method predicts stronger interaction energies than PBE-D2, especially for the more favorable configurations.The new CH2_sp3_UA interaction parameters for DREIDING, PBE-D2 FF, and VDW-DF2 FF are presented in Table 3. Comparing the \u03b5 values for DREIDING with the DFT FFs shows that the \u03b5(C\u2013CH2) does not change much, while the \u03b5(O\u2013CH2) increases \u223c50%. This is similar to the higher \u03b5(O\u2013CH3) observed for our DFT-derived ethane force fields in section 3.2.4.Table 3.

The VDW-DF2 FF predicts a higher uptake of propane than PBE-D2 FF and DREIDING. This is expected as the highest interaction energies are obtained with the vdW-DF2 DFT calculations (Figure S3).Similar to the ethane case discussed earlier, all three adsorption isotherms lie between the scaled and the unscaled experimental data. The experimental data for propane comes from the same study as the ethane data discussed above. For the same reasons as with the experimental ethane isotherms, the propane data does not allow a firm conclusion to be drawn on which simulated isotherm is more accurate.Figure 9. Comparison of the simulated heat of adsorption for ethane, propane, and butane in MIL-47(V) at 303 K. The experimental microcalorimetry data measured by Rosenbach et al.(59) is included for comparison. NC refers to the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule.Even though we choose to not compare our GCMC results for light hydrocarbons to the full experimental isotherms, it is reasonable to compare the experimental and simulated heat of adsorption (\u0394H) at low loadings. As reliable experimental adsorption isotherms at multiple temperatures are unavailable for this system, we compare our \u0394H results with microcalorimetric measurements.(59) Figure 9 compares the low-loading (P/P0 = 0.001) \u0394H obtained from CBMC simulations with the microcalorimetry measurements of Rosenbach et al.(59) at 303 K for ethane, propane, and butane. As expected from our DFT calculations, the simulated heat of adsorption for C2\u2013C4 hydrocarbons is the lowest for PBE-D2 FF. The VDW-DF2 FF and DREIDING values are comparable to each other and are within 2 kJ/mol of the experimental measurement. It is encouraging that the slope of the line for VDW-DF2 FF (8.6 mol per \u2212CH2) is similar to the experimental result (8.25 kJ/mol per \u2212CH2).Having verified that the predicted low loading heats of adsorption for C2 to C4 hydrocarbons are reasonable, we now proceed to extending our method to higher alkanes.3.4Force Field for Higher AlkanesLinear alkanes described using the TraPPE FF consist of only two types from interaction centers: CH3_sp3_UA and CH2_sp3_UA. Using the force field parameters listed in Tables 1 and 3, we can predict the adsorption of all linear alkanes using our DFT-derived FFs.Figure 10 compares the experimental adsorption isotherms for C5\u2013C9 alkanes in MIL-47 (V) at 303 K reported by D\u00e9roche et al.(58) with the predicted uptakes using DREIDING, PBE-D2 FF, and VDW-DF2 FF, respectively. Even though the BET surface areas of the MOF sample have not been explicitly reported by D\u00e9roche et al.,(58) they did not rescale the adsorption isotherms while comparing their simulated isotherms. We therefore compare our data to the experimental results on the same basis while acknowledging that this would be more satisfactory if information about the surface area of the experimental sample was available.Figure 10. Adsorption isotherms for pentane (black), hexane (red), heptane (green), octane (blue), and nonane (cyan) in MIL-47(V) at 303 K. The predictions from CBMC (filled circles) using (a) DREIDING FF, (b) PBE-D2 FF, and (c) VDW-DF2 FF are compared with the experimental data from D\u00e9roche et al.(58) (open diamonds).We will first discuss the adsorption of C5\u2013C8 alkanes using the three force fields. The DREIDING force field underestimates the adsorption of C5\u2013C8 alkanes over the entire pressure range. For these alkanes, the saturation capacity is systematically \u223c0.5 mmol/g lower than the experimental value. On the other hand, PBE-D2 FF gives significantly better agreement with the experimental data for C6 to C8 alkanes, both at lower pressures and at saturation. For pentane, a slight underestimation of \u223c0.2 mmol/g is observed at all pressures. The best prediction of the experimental data over the whole pressure range is obtained for the VDW-DF2 FF. In addition to getting the correct saturation capacity for C5\u2013C8 at higher pressures, the shape of the predicted isotherms is in very good agreement with the experimental data for the C5\u2013C8 linear alkanes.We now turn to the inconsistency in the simulated and experimental isotherms for nonane (Figure 10). Given that VDW-DF2 FF works well for the other alkanes, it is surprising that the saturation capacity of nonane is overestimated. The case for nonane is interesting because the experimental isotherm is lower than the simulated values for all three FFs. To examine this discrepancy, we used the experimental and VDW-DF2 FF isotherms to calculate the number of C atoms per unit cell at saturation for C5\u2013C9 alkanes. Figure S5 shows that the MIL-47(V) unit cell saturates at approximately 20 C atoms/unit cell for all hydrocarbons, except when the experimental nonane saturation capacity is used (1.9 mmol/g, 17 C/u.c). In contrast, the saturation capacity from the VDW-DF2 FF (2.2 mmol/g) corresponds to the same density (20 C/u.c.) calculated for the other cases. This result suggests that the experimental results for nonane adsorption may have been influenced by a kinetic limitations that cannot be considered in our equilibrium calculations.(58, 73) It is noteworthy that the excellent adsorption predictions in Figure 10(b,c) are obtained by using FFs that are developed purely from theoretical methods and do not require any information or parameter tuning from experimental data.The performance of VDW-DF2 FF is further confirmed by comparing the low loading heat of adsorption (\u0394H) for different force fields with the experimental values obtained by using Henry\u2019s constants.(74) Figure 11 shows that the simulated \u0394H values for C5\u2013C7 hydrocarbons from VDW-DF2 FF are within 1 kJ/mol of the experimental data. The PBE-D2 FF systematically underpredicts the heat of adsorption, which is consistent with the relatively lower PBE-D2 interaction energies for ethane and propane (Figure 5 and Figure S3). On the other hand, DREIDING FF gives reasonable agreement with experimental and vdW-DF2 heat of adsorption, but fails at predicting the correct saturation capacities (Figure 10(c)).Figure 11. Simulated heat of adsorption for C5, C6, and C7 alkanes at low loadings (P/P0 = 0.001) from DREIDING, PBE-D2 FF, and vdW-DF2 FF compared to the experimental zero-coverage heat of adsorption obtained from experimental Henry\u2019s constants.(74)In summary, as the VDW-DF2 FF gives excellent agreement with low coverage heat of adsorption measurements and experimental adsorption isotherms for a wide range of linear alkanes, we conclude that VDW-DF2 FF correctly describes the alkane/MIL-47(V) system. Even though the PBE-D2 FF does not perform as well as VDW-DF2 FF, it is still a considerable improvement over the original DREIDING force field.3.5Comparison of DFT-Derived and Generic FFsGiven that our DFT-derived FFs perform significantly better than DREIDING, it is important to explore the characteristics that distinguish them from the generic models. Similar to our DREIDING calculations, D\u00e9roche et al.(58) have reported adsorption isotherms for C5\u2013C9 alkanes using (1) the UFF force field and (2) a combined UFF + DREIDING approach. In both the cases, unsatisfactory prediction of the saturation capacities and/or the low-pressure region is observed. Typically, self-interaction parameters defined by UFF or DREIDING for the framework atoms are combined with the fluid model using Lorentz\u2013Berthelot mixing rules to obtain the required cross-species interactions. For the FFs developed in this work, we directly derive the cross-species interaction parameters from fitting to DFT calculations (Tables 1 and 3). Using these cross-species interactions and assuming Lorentz\u2013Berthelot mixing rules to be valid, we obtain the self-interaction parameters for the framework atoms based on DFT FF parameters. The force fields are referred to as PBE-D2-LB and VDW-DF2-LB in Table 4.Table 4. Self-Interaction Parameters (\u03b5, K) for Generic and DFT-Derived Force Fields to Be Used in Conjunction with Lorentz\u2013Berthelot Mixing RulesframeworkatomUFFDREIDINGPBE-D2-LBFFVDW-DF2-LBFFC\u2013C52.8747.8739.1643.38O\u2013O30.2130.21115.85100.41V\u2013V8.068.060.000.00H\u2013H22.167.650.285.21Our calculations show that the \u03b5(C\u2013C) self-interaction parameters for the DREIDING (UFF) force fields are only \u223c20% (10%) higher than for VDW-DF2 FF. On the other hand, for both DFT-derived FFs, the \u03b5(O\u2013O) values are \u223c300% higher than the generic FFs. This observation indicates that the chemical environment of the oxygen atom bound to the metal center and subsequently its interaction with the hydrocarbon is not well represented by UFF or DREIDING. Instead, using DFT calculations to derive the FF parameters allows for a more accurate description of the system and results in a better prediction of adsorption properties.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionForce Field Development AlgorithmModeling Alkane Adsorption in MIL-47(V)Diffusion of Alkanes in MIL-47(V)Force Field Development for AlkenesForce Field Transferability to the MIL-53 SeriesSummaryReferences4 Diffusion of Alkanes in MIL-47(V)Previously, we demonstrated that the VDW-DF2 FF performs better than the generic FFs at predicting the adsorption properties of alkanes in MIL-47(V). In this section, we discuss the diffusion properties of alkanes using VDW-DF2 FF and DREIDING FF.Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the NVT ensemble were used to calculate the diffusivities of C2\u2013C7 alkanes in MIL-47(V) at 300 K. All MD calculations were performed in RASPA(69) using a rigid 8 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 supercell of the framework. A time step of 1.0 fs was determined to be sufficient to ensure energy conservation. A typical MD trajectory consisted of 106 equilibration steps followed by 107 production steps during which the mean-squared deviation (MSD) of the alkane was measured. An order-N scheme(75) was used to calculate the self-diffusion coefficients from the MSD data. We used a minimum of five independent trajectories to calculate the average self-diffusion coefficient for each hydrocarbon.Figure 12 compares the self-diffusivities (Ds) obtained for different alkanes at a fixed loading of 3 C atoms per unit cell at 300 K. This allows us to compare our self-diffusivities with experimental QENS measurements at the same loading.(60, 76) The MD results in Figure 12 show that the self-diffusivity of alkanes in MIL-47(V) calculated using VDW-DF2 FF is in good agreement with the experimental results for C2\u2013C7 alkanes. For these alkanes, slightly higher diffusion coefficients are predicted for the DREIDING FF. Because of its large 1D pores, it is not surprising that the diffusivities of alkanes in MIL-47(V) are insensitive to the details of the FF. Moreover, the observed diffusivities are similar to the expected self-diffusion coefficients for liquid hydrocarbons.(77, 78) The experimentally observed sharp decrease in the diffusivity for longer alkanes (C8\u2013C16) is not observed from our calculations with either FF. This may be due to the representation of the alkanes as united atoms in our force field. Similar discrepancies have been previously observed for molecular diffusion in silicalite, although the origin of these discrepancies remains unclear.(60, 79) As MIL-47(V) consists of large 1D pores, our results suggest that Ds is not a strong function of the carbon chain length for short alkanes.Figure 12. Average self-diffusion coefficients of C2\u2013C9, C12, and C16 alkanes obtained from NVT MD simulations at 300 K using VDW-DF2 FF (red squares) and DREIDING FF (green squares). The error bars denote the range of Ds values obtained from five independent MD simulations. Experimental QENS values reported by Rives et al.(60) are represented by the black circles. Note that the orientationally averaged self-diffusion coefficient is defined as Ds = D1D/3.A decrease in the self-diffusion coefficient has been reported by Jobic et al.(76) at higher loadings of ethane, propane, and butane in MIL-47(V). Similar to our previous approach, we calculated diffusivities for C2\u2013C4 alkanes at multiple loadings (0.5\u20133.5 molecules/u.c.) using VDW-DF2 FF. The predicted ethane and butane self-diffusivities agree very well with the QENS measurements (Figure 13). However, our MD simulations overestimate propane diffusion at low loadings. The experimental measurements indicate that butane diffuses faster than propane, which has been described by a so-called \u201cblowgun\u201d effect.(76) This effect is not seen in our MD simulations using VDW-DF2 or DREIDING FF (Figure S6), where the diffusivity decreases on going from ethane to butane over the entire range of alkane loadings.Figure 13. Self-diffusion coefficients calculated from NVT MD simulations at 300 K using VDW-DF2 FF for ethane (open red circles), propane (open blue diamonds), and butane (open green triangles). The error bars denote the range of Ds values obtained from five independent MD simulations. The experimental QENS measurements from Jobic et al.(76) are shown with filled symbols.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionForce Field Development AlgorithmModeling Alkane Adsorption in MIL-47(V)Diffusion of Alkanes in MIL-47(V)Force Field Development for AlkenesForce Field Transferability to the MIL-53 SeriesSummaryReferences5 Force Field Development for AlkenesIn sections 3 and 4, we showed that VDW-DF2 FF successfully predicts the adsorption and diffusion properties of alkanes in MIL-47(V). This approach is not restricted to alkanes and can easily be extended to other adsorbates. As an example, we developed a force field for modeling the adsorption of ethene, propene, and higher olefins in MIL-47(V) using PBE-D2 and vdW-DF2 DFT calculations. Results of the FF fitting procedure are shown in Figure S7\u2013S9, and the fitted parameters are reported in Table S9.Figure S10 presents the single-component adsorption isotherms of C3\u2013C7 linear alkenes in MIL-47(V) at 303 K using DREIDING, PBE-D2, and VDW-DF2 FF. Similar to the previous alkane results, the VDW-DF2 FF predicts the highest olefin uptakes. To the best of our knowledge, olefin isotherms have not been reported experimentally, so direct validation of the DFT-derived FFs is not possible. As VDW-DF2 FF performs better than the other FFs for the alkane/MIL-47(V) system, we limit the discussion here to the VDW-DF2 FF results.To investigate the olefin/paraffin separation characteristics of MIL-47(V), we performed binary CBMC simulations for 50/50 bulk mixtures of C3\u2013C7 linear alkanes and alkenes. The results shown in Figure S11 indicate that even though MIL-47(V) does not contain any unsaturated metal sites, olefins are preferentially adsorbed from the equimolar olefin/paraffin mixture. The preferential adsorption of olefins over paraffins can be attributed to the stronger interaction of the O atom with the sp2 C atoms of the alkene (Table S9). The predicted olefin/paraffin selectivity decreases from \u223c2.3 for C3 to 1.7 for C7 hydrocarbons under saturation conditions.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionForce Field Development AlgorithmModeling Alkane Adsorption in MIL-47(V)Diffusion of Alkanes in MIL-47(V)Force Field Development for AlkenesForce Field Transferability to the MIL-53 SeriesSummaryReferences6 Force Field Transferability to the MIL-53 SeriesHaving established that the DFT-derived VDW-DF2 force field successfully predicts the adsorption and diffusion of alkanes in MIL-47(V), we now focus on evaluating the transferability of our force field to the MIL-53 series.Since its first synthesis by Millange et al.,(62, 80) the MIL-53 family of flexible MOFs has attracted attention because of its guest-induced breathing behavior.(62, 81, 82) A number of experimental and modeling groups have studied the structural transitions in MIL-53(Al, Fe, Cr, Ga, Sc) upon the adsorption of H2, CH4, CO2, H2O, and hydrocarbons.(62, 63, 82-86) These and related studies have been recently reviewed by Alhamami et al.(81) and Schneemann et al.(87) Even though a variety of techniques have been explored for modeling these materials,(87) our focus here is limited to studying the adsorption of short linear alkanes in MIL-53(Cr) and MIL-53(Fe) using the VDW-DF2 FF.6.1Alkane Adsorption in MIL-53(Cr)We will first discuss the breathing behavior in MIL-53(Cr).(59) X-ray powder diffraction results and adsorption measurements(59, 61) indicate a narrow pore (NP) to large pore (LP) structural transition in MIL-53(Cr) on adsorption of ethane, propane, and butane (Figure S12). This transition is clearly seen as steps in the experimental propane and butane adsorption isotherms (Figure S13), while the transition due to ethane is suggested from XRD results of Llewellyn et al.(61) The XRD results also suggest that the both LP and NP phases exist simultaneously over a significant pressure range.(61)The predicted CBMC isotherms are obtained using the following procedure. We first optimize LP and NP structures for MIL-53(Cr) using DFT, based on experimentally reported cell parameters for ethane, propane, and butane adsorption.(61) For both LP and NP structure corresponding to each alkane, we predict CBMC isotherms using the rigid framework and the VDW-DF2 FF. The predicted adsorption data is then fit to a dual-site Langmuir model. The final combined isotherms are obtained by directly using the \u201cphase mixture\u201d model of Rosenbach et al.(59) for propane and butane. This model was derived from hybrid GCMC/MD simulations of the MIL-53(Cr) framework.(88) As a significant step in the ethane adsorption isotherm is not observed experimentally, we report only the LP adsorption isotherm. Details of the DFT optimization, phase mixture model, and dual-site Langmuir fits are presented in the Supporting Information.Figure 14 compares the experimentally reported adsorption isotherms for (a) ethane, (b) propane, and (c) butane with the predicted CBMC isotherms using the aforementioned procedure. Figure 14(a) indicates that the predicted ethane adsorption isotherm in the LP MIL-53(Cr) structure slightly overestimates (\u223c0.15 mmol/g) the experimental data, though the shape of the isotherm is well predicted. By using the phase mixture model,(59) we obtain a good description of the transition region for butane, but the saturation capacity is slightly overestimated (\u223c0.1 mmol/g). For propane, the phase mixture model predicts a much sharper transition region than the experimental observations. However, the VDW-DF2 FF isotherm in the LP form is in very good agreement with the experimental data.Overall, we can conclude that the VDW-DF2 FF reasonably predicts the transition region and the adsorption isotherms over the entire pressure range. The discrepancies noted in the predicted and experimental adsorption isotherm may arise from the simultaneous existence of LP and NP phases leading to a continuous volume change on hydrocarbon adsorption.Figure 14. Adsorption isotherms for (a) ethane, (b) propane, and (c) butane in MIL-53(Cr) at 303 K. The experimental data from Rosenbach et al.(59) (black circles) is compared to the CBMC predictions (red circles). The dual-site Langmuir fits to the LP and NP CBMC adsorption isotherms are shown by the blue and green solid lines, respectively. The inset in each figure shows the zoomed-in region close to the transition pressure.6.2Phase Transitions in MIL-53(Fe)Given that the VDW-DF2 FF predictions for MIL-53(Cr) are in good agreement with experimental data, we now turn to studying the adsorption in the Fe version of MIL-53. Compared to the MIL-53(Cr) case, hydrocarbon adsorption in MIL-53(Fe) is further complicated by the existence of two more phases in addition to the LP and NP forms.(63, 89) These are denoted as very narrow pore form (VNP) and intermediate (INT) phases and are shown schematically in Figure S16.(63) In this section, we discuss the application of our force field to calculate the relative free-energy differences for the experimentally observed phases of MIL-53(Fe) using OFAST.(90)Llewellyn et al.(63) have measured the experimental adsorption isotherms of ethane, propane, and butane in MIL-53(Fe) at 303 K (Figure S17). In contrast to the MIL-53(Cr) case, a guest-induced transition for all three alkanes is clearly observed. The complex adsorption behavior for the three alkanes and the phase transitions has been described in the original publication.(63)The free-energy differences of MIL-53(Al, Cr, Sc, Ga) analogues have been studied using DFT calculations and/or the OFAST approach for different adsorbates.(84, 85, 91, 92) To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any computational studies for modeling hydrocarbon adsorption in MIL-53(Fe). As a \u201cphase mixture\u201d model(88) for MIL-53(Fe) has not been reported in the literature, we use the osmotic framework adsorbed solution theory (OFAST) approach to describe the various transitions.(86)At low pressures the PV contribution is negligible, and the governing equation for the isothermal OFAST calculation is(4)where \u0394\u03a9(P) is difference in the grand potential between two structures, \u0394Fhost is the host\u2013host free-energy difference, and Nads(P) is the adsorption isotherm. The OFAST method uses the host\u2013host free-energy difference (\u0394Fhost) and an adsorption-isotherm-dependent solvation term (second term in eq 4) to predict the thermodynamically preferred phase under each adsorption condition. Alternatively, if the transition pressure is known from experimental isotherms, then we can obtain \u0394Fhost for the corresponding transition. Table S16 summarizes the experimentally observed transition pressures for ethane, propane, and butane isotherms. In the following section, we use the VDW-DF2 FF predicted adsorption isotherms and the experimental transition pressures to calculate \u0394Fhost for the VNP \u2192 INT \u2192 NP \u2192 LP transition.Similar to the approach described for MIL-53(Cr), the following steps are used to predict ethane, propane, and butane adsorption isotherms in MIL-53(Fe): (i) DFT optimization using the experimentally reported lattice parameters, (ii) CBMC simulations with the LP, NP, and INT forms of MIL-53(Fe), (iii) fitting CBMC results to the dual-site Langmuir isotherms, and (iv) the OFAST method to obtain the final combined isotherms and calculate \u0394Fhost.Figure 15. Adsorption isotherms for (a) propane and (b) butane in MIL-53(Fe) at 303 K. The experimental data from Llewellyn et al.(63) (black circles) is compared to the CBMC predictions (red circles). The dual-site Langmuir fits to the LP and NP CBMC adsorption isotherms are shown by the blue and green solid lines, respectively. The light-colored regions indicate the experimentally observed dominant phase at different pressures from XRD measurements.As discussed earlier, the OFAST approach necessitates a priori knowledge of \u0394Fhost. Initially, we estimated the free-energy differences from DFT-based phonon calculations for the individual structures, but the results were found to be unsatisfactory (Supporting Information).(85, 93) Instead we use the approach of Coudert et al.,(82) which relies on using the experimentally observed transition pressure and CBMC isotherms to estimate this value.Figure 15 shows the adsorption isotherms (black circles) for propane and butane, respectively, in MIL-53(Fe) at 303 K. The figure also shows the dual-site Langmuir fit for the LP (blue lines) and NP (green lines) structures. For both alkanes, no adsorption uptake is observed at very low pressures. Power XRD experiments(63) suggest the nonporous VNP to be the dominant structure at these pressures. As the pressure is increased, a transition is observed that results in an uptake corresponding to the NP form (green line) of MIL-53(Fe) for both propane and butane. These results imply that the free-energy difference calculated from this transition is dominated by the VNP \u2192 NP transition. Encouragingly, the calculated free-energy differences from the propane isotherm (\u221230.0 kJ/mol-u.c.) are similar to the butane value (\u221232.5 kJ/mol-u.c.).As the pressure is increased further, a second step in the adsorption isotherm is observed for both propane and butane. On the basis of XRD results,(63) this corresponds to the NP \u2192 LP transition, and the calculated free-energy difference is \u22126.12 kJ/mol u.c. (from propane) and \u22126.59 kJ/mol u.c. (from butane). These values for the NP \u2192 LP transition are similar to the ones reported for the MIL-53 (Al, Cr) MOFs. The detailed OFAST results, including the grand potential energy differences, are presented in Figures S18 and S19. As only one structure is predicted from OFAST at each pressure, the steps for the simulated isotherms are much sharper than the experimental data. In the actual material, the LP, NP, and INT phases coexist(63) and result in a smooth isotherm close to the transition pressure.Figure 16. Adsorption isotherms for ethane in MIL-53(Fe) at 303 K. The experimental data from Llewellyn et al.(63) (black circles) is compared to the CBMC predictions (red circles). The dual-site Langmuir fits to the LP and NP CBMC adsorption isotherms are shown by the blue and green solid lines, respectively. The solid cyan line is the single site Langmuir fit to the INT part of the isotherm (1.0 bar < P < 9.4 bar). The light-colored regions indicate the experimentally observed dominant phase at different pressures.We now turn to describing the ethane adsorption isotherm using the OFAST approach. As with propane and butane, the near-zero uptake region at pressures of less than 1 bar corresponds to the nonporous VNP phase. As the pressure is increased, we observe a first step corresponding to \u223c1.3 mmol/g, which is 50% of the first VNP \u2192 NP transition for the propane (\u223c2.7 mmol/g) and butane (\u223c2.64 mmol/g) isotherm (Figure S17). Compared to the NP structure, where all of the pores are available for adsorption, 50% of the pores in the INT structure of MIL-53(Fe) are closed (Figure S16). It is likely that the step corresponding to 1.33 mmol/g is dominated by the INT phase. Moreover, this seems to be consistent with the power XRD results (Figure 16) that indicate the presence of the INT phase. We conclude that unlike propane and butane isotherms (VNP \u2192 NP transition), the first step in the ethane isotherm actually corresponds to the VNP \u2192 INT transition.The CBMC isotherms using the VDW-DF2 force field predicts zero ethane uptake in the INT form of MIL-53(Fe) at all pressures. However, our DFT calculations for a few ethane configurations indicate large interaction energies (\u221235 kJ/mol). Further analysis of these configurations shows the ethane molecule to be highly confined in small channels with the largest cavity diameter of 3.1 \u00c5 (Supporting Information). At such short distances, the united atom description of ethane fails at describing the energetics, and zero uptakes are incorrectly predicted.To circumvent this issue, we fit the isotherm corresponding to the INT phase (1.0 bar < P < 9.4 bar) to a single-site Langmuir model (cyan solid line in Figure 16) and repeat the OFAST calculations to obtain the free-energy difference of \u22126.18 kJ/mol u.c. corresponding to the VNP \u2192 INT. Because only a small region of the experimental data is used to fit the Langmuir isotherm, errors in the \u0394Fhost calculations are possible. Finally, by comparing the CMBC isotherm from the LP form (blue solid line in Figure 16) with the experimental data, we can conclude that the second step observed at \u223c9.4 bar corresponds to the INT \u2192 LP transition with a free-energy difference of \u221230.0 kJ/mol u.c. These free-energy differences can be represented by the energy-level diagram shown in Figure 17 and Table S19. The results indicate that the relative free energies calculated from ethane, propane, and butane adsorption isotherms are consistent with each other.Figure 17. Relative free-energy differences for the very narrow pore (VNP), intermediate (INT), narrow pore (NP), and large pore (LP) structures of MIL-53(Fe) from the ethane (red), propane (blue), and butane (green) isotherms.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionForce Field Development AlgorithmModeling Alkane Adsorption in MIL-47(V)Diffusion of Alkanes in MIL-47(V)Force Field Development for AlkenesForce Field Transferability to the MIL-53 SeriesSummaryReferences7 SummaryIn this work, we have presented a general framework for developing an ab initio force field for adsorbate molecules in nanoporous structures using periodic DFT calculations. This approach has been illustrated for modeling the interactions of short and long alkanes in MIL-47(V), and good predictions of adsorption and diffusion properties are obtained. Our results suggest that even for simple systems such as the adsorption of hydrocarbons in MOFs without open metal sites, the performance of generic force fields such as UFF and DREIDING can be improved using first-principles-derived FFs. An advantage of using this approach is that the developed force fields are likely to be transferable across different adsorbates and can be used for studying a larger library related to MOF materials. We believe that this approach would be an important step in evaluating and improving the performance of generic force fields before systems that are more complex are considered.
