The major constituents in the power plant flue gas include CO2 (\u223c15%) and N2 (\u223c75%); capture of CO2 is desired at about ambient pressure and an elevated temperature (\u223c350 K). The conventional method for CO2 capture involves absorption into an aqueous amine solution; however, this technique has severe drawbacks such as equipment corrosion, amine degradation, and high energy consumption in the solvent regeneration step.(4) A considerable amount of research has been focused on the development of adsorbent-based processes for CO2 capture. Other adsorptive separations of CO2 include its separation from CH4 at pressures as high as 70 bar in natural gas purification and from CO2/CH4/CO mixture in steam reforming of natural gas. In general, adsorptive separation techniques are mainly driven by synthesis of suitable porous adsorbents. A variety of adsorbents such as zeolites, activated carbon, silica gel, activated alumina, etc. have been widely investigated for adsorption and separation of CO2. In addition, over the past decade, a new class of porous adsorbent commonly known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been widely synthesized and investigated by several researchers for CO2 capture and separation applications.(5-24)Metal-organic frameworks are formed by coordinative bridging of metal ions and organic linkers. The choice of metal and organic linker has significant influence on the structure and properties of the framework. These materials have several better characteristics (like high CO2 uptakes/selectivity, easier regeneration, tunable structure, etc.), compared to other conventional adsorbents.(13-24) However, some of the MOFs are not stable and easily degenerate upon exposure to water vapor and other gases.(18, 23, 24) One of the MOFs from the MIL family, MIL-53(Al), has good stability, comparable to that of other conventional adsorbents(6, 24) and it is one of the main reasons behind its choice for this work. This MOF is composed of corner-sharing interconnected Al clusters with benzene dicarboxylate (BDC) organic ligands.(6, 7) Another important characteristic of this material is its structural transformation from the large pore (lp) domain to the narrow pore (np) domain and vice versa (so-called breathing phenomena) upon exposure to certain guest molecules like CO2, H2O, etc.,(6, 8, 10) by applying mechanical pressure,(25-27) or by change in its temperature.(7) The cell volume of MIL-53(Al) decreases by \u223c35%, from 1412 \u00c53 to 947 \u00c53 during its transformation from the lp domain to the np domain.(6)Most of the available studies on MIL-53(Al) attempt to explain the breathing phenomena exhibited by this material upon adsorption of CO2 or H2O.(6-8, 10) However, adsorption isotherms of other polar gases such as CO are rarely reported in the literature.(12, 28) Moreover, in order to evaluate the potential of MIL-53(Al), which has better stability, compared to most of the other MOFs, it is necessary to measure its pure component adsorption capacity over the range of temperature and pressure of interest. In this work, pure gas adsorption isotherms on MIL-53(Al) are measured for industrially relevant gases such as CO2, N2, CH4, and CO. These isotherms are suitably modeled and Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST)(29) is used to predict the selectivity of their binary gas mixtures.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionSynthesisExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferences2 SynthesisThe synthesis of MIL-53(Al) was carried out under hydrothermal conditions using aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)2\u00b79H2O, Aldrich), benzene 1,4-dicarboxylic acid (BDC, Merck), dimethylformamide (DMF, Merck), and deionized water as per the procedure suggested by Loiseau et al.(6) The starting materials with molar composition of 1(Al(NO3)3\u00b79H2O):0.5(BDC):80(H2O) were mixed and placed in a Teflon-lined steel autoclave at 493 K for 3 days. The product was filtered and washed with deionized water. For removal of the unreacted BDC in the resultant product, typically 1 g of as-synthesized MIL-53(Al) and 25 mL of DMF were kept in a Teflon-lined autoclave for 15 h at 423 K.(11) The filtered product was calcined overnight at 553 K.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionSynthesisExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferences3 Experimental SectionThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the synthesized MIL-53(Al) sample was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (Mettler Toledo, Model No. TGA/SDTA 851e). The temperature was ramped from 298 K to 973 K at a heating rate of 5 K min\u20131, and the measurements were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. A Beckman Coulter surface area analyzer (Coulter SA model 3100) was used for performing surface area and pore volume measurements. The specific surface area was calculated from nitrogen physisorption at 77 K in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05\u20130.2, using the BET (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller) model. The pore volume was calculated at a relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.98. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Bruker A8 Avance instrument operating at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) radiation. Adsorption equilibria of all gases were measured gravimetrically in a Rubotherm Magnetic Suspension balance. Prior to each isotherm measurement, MIL-53(Al) was activated by heating it at 493 K under a purge flow of 30 cm3 min\u20131 of helium. Excess amount adsorbed was calculated from the raw measurements using buoyancy corrections.(30, 31) The impenetrable solid volume for buoyancy correction was obtained from helium measurements at 294 K in the pressure range of 0\u201326 bar, using nonadsorbing helium assumption. In order to account for gas phase nonideality at higher pressures, fugacity was used instead of pressure.(31)Top of PageAbstractIntroductionSynthesisExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferences4 Results and DiscussionTGA of the calcined MIL-53(Al) is shown in Figure 1. The TGA profile obtained in this work for MIL-53(Al) is similar to that reported in the literature.(6, 12) The initial weight loss below 373 K is due to the removal of water from the sample. Thereafter, the material continues to show stable weight up to \u223c723 K. The sharp increase in weight loss above 723 K is due to the collapse of MIL-53(Al) structure, i.e., removal of structural BDC linkers from the framework.(6) Thermal stability of this MOF (723 K) is higher than most of the other MOFs such as Zn/DABCO,(20) CuBTC,(30) MIL-101,(18) MOF-210,(17) Mg/DOBDC,(32) etc. Superior thermal stability is also one of the reasons for selecting MIL-53(Al) for this work.Figure 1. Thermogram of MIL-53(Al) at a heating rate of 5 K min\u20131 under a flow of 40 cm3 min\u20131 of N2.Prior to measuring N2 physisorption at 77 K, MIL-53(Al) sample was degassed at 493 K for 2 h. MIL-53(Al) exhibits a reversible, Type-I N2 isotherm at 77 K (Figure 2), indicating the microporous nature of this material. The BET surface area and pore volume were \u223c1284 m2 g\u20131 and 0.64 cm3 g\u20131, respectively. The detailed comparison of these results with the existing literature is provided in Table 1.Figure 2.

The patterns obtained in this work are very close to that of the lp domain of MIL-53(Al) reported by Loiseau et al.(6)Figure 3. X-ray diffractogram of MIL-53(Al) after high-temperature activation.The above TGA, BET, and XRD characterization results match well with previous literature reports; we therefore conclude that MIL-53(Al) MOF has been successfully synthesized for the adsorption studies.CO2 isotherms of MIL-53(Al) at 294, 314, 332, and 350 K are shown in Figure 4. The isotherm at 294 K is in good agreement with the earlier reported data.(8, 10) In general, microporous adsorbents having rigid framework, exhibit Type-I isotherms. However, a Type-IV isotherm was obtained for CO2 adsorption onto microporous MIL-53(Al) at 294 and 314 K. According to the literature,(8, 28) during CO2 adsorption at 294 K, MIL-53(Al) material transforms from the large-pore (lp) phase to the narrow-pore (np) phase at \u223c0.8 bar and remains in the np phase up to \u223c4 bar. After this pressure, reverse transformation from the np to the lp phase occurs resulting in a sudden increase in the adsorption uptake. This structural transformation results in the Type-IV isotherm.Figure 4. CO2 adsorption isotherms on MIL-53(Al) at (\u25cf) 294 K, (\u25b2) 314 K, (\u25a0) 332 K, and (\u25c6) 350 K. Symbols are experimental data; lines are fits obtained using model parameters (given in Tables S6 and S7 in the Supporting Information).It is reported in the literature that MIL-53(Al) transforms from the lp phase to the np phase, because of hydrogen bonding between the adsorbate molecules and the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate and the \u03bc2-hydroxo group.(8) The np-to-lp phase transformation occurs at high pressure, because of the stress in the framework.(10) Both the lp-to-np and subsequent np-to-lp transformations at 314 K occur at a higher pressure, compared to those at 294 K. As the temperature is further increased (to 332 and 350 K), CO2 isotherms show a Type-I behavior and adsorbent does not exhibit structural transformation. This observation matches closely with the predicted temperature-vapor pressure phase diagram for CO2 adsorption on MIL-53(Al) by Boutin et al.,(10) indicating the absence of structural transformation at temperatures above 340 K.The CO2 loading on the MIL-53(Al) sample under ambient conditions is higher than that on many other adsorbents such as IRMOF-1,(35) IRMOF-3,(35) MOF-177,(35) ZIF-8,(35) MIL-47,(8) AC (Norit R1),(36) H-mordenite,(37) silicalite,(38) and ZnDABCO;(20) however, it is lower than that on benchmark Zeolite 13X,(39) and some open metal sites containing MOFs such as CuBTC,(39) and MgDOBDC.(32) Although the CO2 capacity for CuBTC and MgDOBDC is better, unlike MIL-53(Al), these MOFs are not stable in a humid environment.(24) Thus, MIL-53(Al) may be a potential MOF-based adsorbent for CO2 separation applications.The isotherms of other gases on MIL-53(Al) at 294, 314, and 350 K are shown in Figures 5\u20137. The CH4 isotherm at 294 K matches well with that reported in the literature.(8, 10, 28) Similarly, N2 and CO adsorption uptakes at 294 K closely follow the literature data.(12, 28) To the best of our knowledge, none of the literature reports adsorption isotherms of these gases at higher temperatures.As expected, relatively nonpolar CH4 (Figure 5) and N2 (Figure 6) gases did not induce any structural change and exhibit Type-I isotherms for all three temperatures. In fact, the isotherms for even CO (which has a dipole moment) show Type-I behavior at the three experimental temperatures (see Figure 7).Figure 5. CH4 adsorption isotherms on MIL-53(Al) at (\u25cf) 294 K, (\u25b2) 314 K, and (\u25c6) 350 K. Symbols are experimental data; lines are fits obtained using model parameters (given in Table S6 in the Supporting Information).Figure 6. N2 adsorption isotherms on MIL-53(Al) at (\u25cf) 294 K, (\u25b2) 314 K, and (\u25c6) 350 K. Symbols are experimental data; lines are fits obtained using model parameters (given in Table S6 in the Supporting Information).Figure 7. CO adsorption isotherms on MIL-53(Al) at (\u25cf) 294 K, (\u25b2) 314 K, and (\u25c6) 350 K. Symbols are experimental data; lines are fits obtained using model parameters (given in Table S6 in the Supporting Information).The adsorption capacity of CO2 on MIL-53(Al) is higher than that of the other three gases. Since the kinetic diameter of CO2 is smallest, it also exhibits higher saturation uptake than other gases. Although CO has a permanent dipole, its adsorption uptake is lower than that of CH4 (CH4 has higher polarizability than CO). N2 has the lowest adsorption uptake, because of its low polarizability and quadrupole moment (physical properties of studied gases are given in Table S1 in the Supporting Information).Attempts were made to model the experimental results using a Langmuir isotherm. A simple Langmuir equation did not fit the isotherm well enough, possibly because of its inability to describe the heterogeneity that is likely to exist in MOFs (because of the presence of several groups in their structure). On the other hand, a virial isotherm (eq 1) is versatile and was used to describe the adsorption behavior of CO, N2, and CH4 on this MOF with good statistical significance:(1)where N (mol kg\u20131) is the amount adsorbed, f (bar) is the fugacity, \u03b2 (mol kg\u20131 bar\u20131) is Henry\u2019s constant, and b (mol\u20131 kg) and c (mol\u20132 kg2) are the second and third virial coefficients, respectively. The usual temperature dependency was considered for these parameters:(2)where T is the temperature (in Kelvin). This model was also used to fit Type-I isotherms of CO2 at higher temperatures (332 and 350 K). The modeling results are included in Figures 4\u20137, along with the experimental data; the parameter values are given in Table S6 in the Supporting Information.In the literature, attempts were made to model the Type-IV behavior of the CO2 isotherm on this material by assuming that adsorption on each one of the two phases (np and lp) follows a Langmuir model; the two sets of model parameters (one per phase) were obtained by using experimental data in the low-pressure region (0\u20135 bar) for the np phase, and in the high-pressure region (9\u201330 bar) for the lp phase.(40) However, in this work, we have used a dual-site Langmuir-type model (eq 3) to fit the isotherm over the entire pressure:(3)where N1max and N2max (mol kg \u20131) represent the saturation capacities of the np phase and lp phase, respectively; b1 and b2 (bar\u20131) are affinity parameters for the np phase and lp phase, respectively.In addition to the conventional Langmuir-type terms for describing the adsorption uptake on the two sites (corresponding to the np and lp phases), an additional parameter \u03c8 appears in this model. The significance of this parameter can be readily seen by rearranging eq 3 to yield(4)where N denotes the actual amount adsorbed on the material at a temperature T and fugacity f, Nlp and Nnp denote the amounts adsorbed at the same bulk gas conditions, if the material were to exist in pure lp and pure np forms, respectively. Thus, \u03c8 is the uptake capacity as a fraction of the difference between the uptakes on the lp and np phases under the same conditions. Since the uptake capacity at any given condition is related to the \u201ctrue\u201d structure of the bulk adsorbent material (i.e., a pure np phase or a pure lp phase or somewhere between these two phases), \u03c8 will also be related to the extent of np to lp structural transformation. It must be mentioned that it will not be possible to obtain the extent of structural transformation, when the isotherm is modeled using the low-pressure and high-pressure experimental data separately.In this work, we use a normal distribution function to represent the variation of \u03c8 with fugacity at a given temperature:(5)where m is the mean and s is the standard deviation for the underlying Gaussian.This model successfully describes the CO2 isotherms (at 294 and 314 K) involving structural transition (Figure 4). The parameters for the model are given in Table S7 in the Supporting Information.Figure 8 shows the variation of \u03c8 with fugacity at the two temperatures and can be used to identify the fugacity range corresponding to the structural transition. At 294 and 314 K, the transition occurs approximately between 2.4\u20137.2 bar and 5.7\u201310.8 bar, respectively. In addition, one can also identify the bulk gas condition where the transition is maximum (corresponding to the parameter m).Figure 8. Variation of \u03c8 with fugacity during adsorption of CO2 on MIL-53(Al) at 294 K (solid line) and 314 K (dashed line).Using the model parameters, the Henry\u2019s constant of CO2 at 294 K for the np phase (5.98 mol kg\u20131 bar\u20131) is higher than that for the lp phase (4.43 mol kg\u20131 bar\u20131). These values are similar to earlier reports (9 and 2.6 mol kg\u20131 bar\u20131, respectively, for the np and lp phases) and indicate higher affinity of the np phase for CO2 adsorption.(40)The enthalpy of adsorption is a measure of the strength of adsorbate\u2013adsorbent interactions and also governs the ease of regeneration. The adsorption enthalpies at zero loading (\u2212\u0394hads,0) shown in Figure 9 are calculated from the model parameters. While N2 and CO have similar values, CH4 has higher enthalpy (\u2212\u0394hads,0), because of its polarizability.(41) The adsorption enthalpy for CH4 obtained in this work (\u223c24.6 kJ mol\u20131) is slightly higher than that measured experimentally by Bourrelly et al.(8) In the case of CO2, the enthalpy of adsorption is calculated for both the np and lp phases from the Langmuir model parameters (eq 3) obtained using the adsorption data at 294 and 314 K. The enthalpy (\u2212\u0394hads,0) obtained in this work for the lp phase (\u223c26.3 kJ mol\u20131) is similar to that obtained by Boutin et al.(10) and it is slightly higher than the reported value (\u223c18 kJ mol\u20131) obtained by calorimetry at room temperature.(8) On the other hand, the enthalpy (\u2212\u0394hads,0) of the np phase (\u223c41 kJ mol\u20131) is significantly higher than that of the lp phase, indicating stronger interactions of the CO2 molecules with the np phase of the adsorbent. This value matches well with that obtained by Bourrelly et al.(8) (\u223c36\u201340 kJ mol\u20131) from calorimetry and that obtained by Boutin et al.(10) (\u223c38.8 kJ mol\u20131).Figure 9. Enthalpy of adsorption at zero coverage on MIL-53(Al) for various gases.In addition to good uptake capacity, an adsorbent must also have good CO2 selectivity. At lower temperatures, when the structure of the adsorbent is not rigid, a host of factors (including its history) govern the adsorption characteristics of a gas mixture.(28) In any case, for separation of CO2 from industrial flue gases, selectivity values at higher temperatures will be more relevant. The selectivity for various relevant equimolar gas mixtures at 350 K is shown in Figure 10. These values were calculated from Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) using the pure gas isotherm models.(29) At low coverage, CO2 selectivity over both CO and N2 is \u223c4.5; this value slightly increases with pressure. In addition, the adsorbent is also selective for CO2 over CH4 and is slightly selective for CH4 over CO and N2.Figure 10. Variation of selectivity with pressure on MIL-53(Al) for various equimolar binary mixtures at 350 K.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionSynthesisExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferences5 ConclusionsIn this work, adsorption characteristics of MIL-53(Al) MOF were studied for industrially relevant gases over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. CO, CH4, and N2 exhibit Type-I isotherm behavior. CO2 isotherms at the two higher experimental temperatures (332 and 350 K) also follow this trend, indicating the absence of structural transformation in MIL-53(Al). However, adsorption of CO2 at the two lower temperatures (294 and 314 K) induced the transformation in the adsorbent structure and as a result the isotherms are of Type-IV. A temperature-dependent virial equation was successful in modeling the Type-I isotherms for all of the gases. On the other hand, for modeling of Type-IV isotherms of CO2, an additional parameter was included in the conventional dual-site Langmuir formulation to account for the transformation from the np phase to the lp phase. Higher adsorption enthalpy at zero coverage for CO2 on the np phase (\u223c41 kJ mol\u20131) than that on the lp phase (\u223c26.3 kJ mol\u20131) indicates better affinity between CO2 molecules and the np phase of MIL-53(Al). While the enthalpy of adsorption for CH4 is close to that of CO2 on the lp phase, the enthalpies for CO and N2 were significantly lower (<15 kJ mol\u20131). At 350 K, the selectivity predicted by IAST for CO2 over CO and N2 is between 4.5 and 8 for the pressure range considered. The stability of the MIL-53(Al), along with good selectivity for CO2 at high temperature, should make this adsorbent a potential candidate for further studies.
