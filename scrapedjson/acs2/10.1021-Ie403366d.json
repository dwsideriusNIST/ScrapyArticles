Specifically, many respirators used by emergency and/or military personnel require broad-spectrum chemical removal because of the wide variety of toxic chemicals used worldwide. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) requires chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) filters to provide protection against a wide variety of gases, including ammonia (NH3) and cyanogen chloride (CNCl).(1) These two chemicals require different chemistries for removal. NH3 is typically removed through interaction with acidic sites or hydrogen-bonding sites,(2, 3) whereas CNCl requires hydrolysis and/or interaction with functional groups capable of reacting with the cyanide moiety.(4, 5)Several studies on activated, impregnated carbons have demonstrated the ability to create conflicting chemistries on a single sorbent.(6, 7) Yet, most of these efforts focus on postsynthetic impregnation techniques, creating a mobile active phase that shows poor aging characteristics as a result of deleterious interactions within the substrate.Over the past decade, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensely studied for a variety of potential applications, including gas storage,(8, 9) catalysis,(10, 11) separations,(12-14) and toxic gas removal.(15-17) The ability to incorporate multiple functionalities(18-20) into the backbone of MOFs is a major advantage over traditional activated, impregnated carbons. The UiO-66 series of MOFs are of particular interest because of their stability toward moisture and acids.(21-23) UiO-66-NH2, which contains amine pendant groups on benzene dicarboxylate linkers, is capable of postsynthetic modification, allowing for further tailoring of functionality.(24) However, even without modification, the amine groups provide hydrogen-bonding sites for NH3 sorption, as well as possible reactive sites for CNCl.Several studies have been conducted on how physical properties and performance are affected by pressurization and/or other methods of forming granules and particles.(25-27) We previously investigated the effects of pressure on CuBTC and UiO-66 MOFs at pressures ranging from 1000 to 10000 psi, with results indicating that the UiO-66 material does not show degradation in surface area or performance.(28) In this study, we investigated how pressure affects the physical properties and chemical removal performance of UiO-66-NH2, with the objective of forming particles for simulated filter breakthrough testing against NH3 and CNCl. UiO-66-NH2 was chosen as a candidate material over UiO-66 because of its increased performance against ammonia (Figure S1, Supporting Information).Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferences2 Experimental SectionUiO-66-NH2 was synthesized by modifying established methods for large scale.(29) Zirconium(IV) chloride (12 g) and water (3 mL) were added to 800 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirred until fully dissolved. 2-Aminoterephthalic acid (9.4 g) was added to 400 mL of DMF and stirred until fully dissolved. The solutions were mixed in a B\u00fcchiGlasUster Ecoclave 075 batch reactor with 1.6 L glass reactor vessel. The reactor was stirred at 500 RPM and held at 120 \u00b0C for 24 h. The pale yellow solid was isolated by filtration. Up to seven batches were mixed for subsequent steps.Samples were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol for 24 h. Excess solvent was removed by heating in air at 85 \u00b0C. Removal of solvent from the pores was achieved by evacuating the samples to <50 mTorr and heating at 85 \u00b0C for 4 h and then at 150 \u00b0C for 18 h. The reaction yield after solvent removal was measured at 84%.In the initial pressurization study, approximately 1 g of UiO-66-NH2 powder was pressed into pellets using a Carver Press and 0.5-in. die at loads of 1000, 2000, 5000, and 20000 lbs, corresponding to pressures of approximately 5000, 10000, 25000, and 100000 psi, respectively. The pellets were then ground into powders to conduct appropriate characterization and performance studies. Subsequent pellets were made with a 1.5-in. die using approximately 5 g of UiO-66-NH2 powder, made into granules using a Sepor jaw crusher, and then sieved to 20 \u00d7 40 mesh particles. A broad-spectrum carbon (BSC) was acquired from 3M (Minneapolis, MN) in a 20 \u00d7 40 mesh particle size distribution as a baseline for breakthrough performance.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were recorded using a PANalytical X\u2019Pert X-ray powder diffractometer with an X\u2019celerator detector. Samples were scanned at 45 kV and 40 mA using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.54 \u00c5) and a step size of 2\u03b8 = 0.033\u00b0 (10.08 s/step) over a 2\u03b8 range of 5\u201330\u00b0. Zero-background disks were used to minimize background scattering. PXRD patterns were processed using the Reflex module in Material Studio 6.1 by Accelrys.Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy data were collected on composites using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer with a platinum accessory and a single-reflection diamond crystal. Sixteen scans from 4000 to 600 cm\u20131 were averaged, and the background was subtracted with a resolution of 4 cm\u20131.Nitrogen isotherm data were collected at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 1200 system. Samples were off-gassed at 120 \u00b0C under nitrogen for approximately 16 h. Surface area measurements were calculated using the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) method, and pore volume was calculated at a relative pressure of 0.975. Pore size distributions were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and a carbon slit pore kernel. A silica\u2013alumina standard run on the system exhibits less than 1% standard deviation on surface area measurements.Microbreakthrough testing was conducted on a push system designed for evaluating small (\u223c20 mg) quantities of powders and has been described previously.(16, 30) Test conditions are summarized in Table 1. Sorbents were activated at 120 \u00b0C for 1 h in flowing dry air, equilibrated at the proper relative humidity (RH) for 2 h as applicable and then packed at a constant volume of approximately 50\u201355 mm3 in a 4-mm-i.d. (nominal) fritted glass tube to a height of 4 mm. Each chemical was injected into a ballast and then pressurized; from the ballast, the chemical was delivered to either a dry or humidified air stream at a rate necessary to achieve the desired challenge concentration. Water vapor was delivered to the system through a saturator cell within a water bath. The challenge was dosed to a packed bed until saturation (effluent = feed), after which the materials were purged with air to evaluate desorption. Effluent concentrations were monitored using Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5890 gas chromatographs equipped with a flame ionization detector (CNCl) and a photoionization detector (NH3). Microbreakthrough graphs are plotted on a mass-weighted basis to account for differences in density. Loadings were calculated in moles per kilogram by integrating the breakthrough curves to saturation. The standard system error is approximately 10%.Table 1.

Each gas was delivered directly from a cylinder through a mass flow controller and then mixed with a diluent air stream at a rate necessary to achieve the required challenge concentration. The diluent stream flow and humidity were controlled using a Miller-Nelson HCS-401 system. Test tubes were packed using a storm-filling method(31) to a depth of 1.0 cm, simulating full-scale individual protection filters. The NH3 feed and effluent concentrations were monitored using a Miran 1A infrared detector and an Innova 1314 Photoacoustics Multigas monitor, respectively. The CNCl feed and effluent concentrations were measured using an HP5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. The breakthrough time was calculated when the effluent concentrations reached 17 and 8 mg/m3, corresponding to military toxic exposure limits for NH3 and CNCl, respectively.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferences3 Results and Discussion3.1Materials CharacterizationFigure 1 presents the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns, and Figure 2 presents the ATR-FTIR spectra for the as-synthesized and pressed samples. The materials pressed between 5000 and 25000 psi all show similar PXRD patterns, indicating that the structural integrity and crystal structure remain intact. The sample pressed at 100000 psi shows peaks with 2\u03b8 values similar to those pressed at lower pressure; however, the decreased signal-to-noise ratio, lower overall intensity, and peak broadening all indicate reduced crystallinity. Similarly, the FTIR-ATR spectra show no noticeable differences between the as-synthesized sample and those pressed up to 25000 psi, indicating that the functional groups remain intact. Yet, the UiO-66-NH2-100K sample shows significant reduction in several FTIR bands.Figure 1. PXRD spectra of UiO-66-NH2 powder and pressed samples.Figure 2. FTIR-ATR spectra of UiO-66-NH2 powder and pressed samples.Nitrogen isotherm data were collected to determine the effects of pressurization on surface area and pore volume. The uptake curves and resulting pore size distributions are illustrated in Figure 3; surface area and pore volume measurements are summarized in Table 2. Initial losses in nitrogen uptake, and thus surface area and pore volume, are modest up to 25000 psi. The surface area of the as-synthesized sample was found to be 1182 m2/g, which is similar to values reported in the literature.(21, 32) The total pore volume of 0.50 cm3/g is also similar to that reported by others.(33) Pressing the powder at 5000 and 10000 psi resulted in 5% and 14% decreases, respectively, in surface area but no noticeable trend in the change of total pore volume. Further increasing the pelletization pressure to 25000 psi decreased the surface area by approximately 26% and the total pore volume by approximately 12%. It is likely that these decreases in surface area are due to increased density from a loss in interparticle voids in the micropore regime during pelletization. A pressure of 100000 psi resulted in surface area and pore volume reductions of 83% and 74%, respectively. Even with these changes in surface area and pore volume, the pore size distribution remained consistent, even up to 100000 psi.Figure 3. (Left) Nitrogen isotherm and (right) pore size distribution (logarithmic scale) data for pressed samples.Table 2.

Figure 4 presents the NH3 breakthrough curves under dry and humid conditions, and Table 3 summarizes the loadings for each sample. A clear trend presents itself, with NH3 uptake decreasing with increasing pelletization pressure under both dry and humid conditions. The as-synthesized sample provides the highest loading on a mass basis, with loadings of 3.3 mol/kg (0.056 g/g) and 2.9 mol/kg (0.082 g/g) under dry and humid conditions, respectively. The loadings themselves are lower than those on other MOFs such as CuBTC(17, 34) and M/DOBDC(16) analogues by several moles per kilogram but surpass those of other sorbents such as zeolite 13X and BPL activated carbon. Furthermore, the enhanced stability of UiO-66-NH2 makes it favorable over other MOFs studied.(23)Figure 4. NH3 microbreakthrough curves under (left) dry and (right) humid conditions.Table 3. NH3 Loadings on UiO-66-NH2sampleRH (%)mass (mg)loading (mol/kg)UiO-66-NH2010.03.38013.52.9UiO-66-NH2-5K017.02.38017.72.2UiO-66-NH2-10K020.62.78023.32.3UiO-66-NH2-25K026.22.28028.51.8UiO-66-NH2-100K040.91.08057.30.8The overall trends seem logical, as the surface area and pore volume also decrease with increasing pressure, resulting in less availability of active sites for NH3 sorption. Based on the shape of the desorption curves, it appears that the removal mechanism is not permanent, as NH3 continues to elute for a relatively long time after feed termination. Coupled with post-NH3-exposure FTIR data (see Figure 5), which show almost no change in functional groups on the surface of the material, and post-NH3-exposure PXRD data (Figure S2, Supporting Information), the likely removal mechanism is simple hydrogen-bonding, likely with both adsorbed moisture as well as pendant amine groups.Figure 5. Post-NH3-exposure FTIR-ATR spectra for UiO-66-NH2.CNCl microbreakthrough curves are illustrated in Figure 6, and calculated loadings are summarized in Table 4. As with the NH3 results, a clear trend is present: the CNCl loading decreases with increasing pelletization pressure. Under dry conditions, most of the materials exhibit traditional S-shaped breakthrough curves, indicating the formation of a wavefront through the materials; however, the UiO-66-NH2-100K sample shows immediate breakthrough, indicating poor diffusional properties to the active sites. The as-synthesized material exhibits a high CNCl loading, and in conjunction with the desorption profiles, the removal mechanism seems to be fairly strong, with the CNCl concentration dropping quickly after feed termination. However, under humid conditions, all samples show immediate breakthrough of CNCl, with a gradual increase to saturation. This behavior indicates that adsorbed water poisons the interaction/reaction with active sites within the UiO-66-NH2 material.Figure 6. CNCl microbreakthrough curves under (left) dry and (right) humid conditions.Table 4. CNCl Loadings on UiO-66-NH2sampleRH (%)mass (mg)loading (mol/kg)UiO-66-NH207.94.1807.81.2UiO-66-NH2-5K010.83.98015.51.0UiO-66-NH2-10K011.32.98011.80.5UiO-66-NH2-25K018.32.78020.50.9UiO-66-NH2-100K033.20.88040.00.3The FTIR spectra in Figure 7 reveal that there is little change in the chemical modes present upon exposure to CNCl under both wet and dry conditions. However, the band observed at \u03bd \u2248 2235 cm\u20131 for UiO-66-NH2 exposed to CNCl under both dry and wet conditions represents a C\u2261N stretch. Because free CNCl shows a band at \u03bd \u2248 2200 cm\u20131, it is unclear whether the observed band represents CNCl in the pores of the MOF or a more complex interaction such as NH2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7NC, similar to that witnessed between CNCl and OH groups by Kim et al.(35) In any case, some CNCl, or byproducts thereof, is present after the desorption step, indicating permanent removal.Figure 7. Post-CNCl-exposure FTIR-ATR spectra for UiO-66-NH2.In all, most samples (except UiO-66-NH2-100K) show high CNCl uptake under dry conditions, ranging from 4.1 mol/kg (0.25 g/g) for the as-synthesized sample to 2.7 mol/kg (0.17 g/g) for the samples pressed at 25000 psi. Even under humid conditions, the actual capacity remains relatively high for multiple samples, albeit at the expense of mass transfer and reaction sites due to moisture poisoning.3.3Engineering and Simulated Filter ExperimentsBecause of the high capacities demonstrated by the UiO-66-NH2 material, scaling to larger quantities was conducted for the purpose of evaluation under conditions simulating individual protection filters. The sample pressed at 5000 psi was chosen because it demonstrated almost no degradation in performance as compared to the as-synthesized powder. As a comparison, breakthrough testing of a 3M broad-spectrum carbon was also conducted. The density of the UiO-66-NH2-5K sample is significantly lower than that of the carbon (Table S1, Supporting Information), and the particle size distribution is skewed toward larger particles (Table S2, Supporting Information).Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the NH3 and CNCl breakthrough curves for the two materials. Results show NH3 begins to break through the packed bed of UiO-66-NH2-5K around 15 min, whereas the BSC material lasts over 20 min before NH3 begins eluting. The breakthrough times were calculated to be 17.3 and 24.9 min for UiO-66-NH2-5K and BSC, respectively, to a concentration of 17 mg/m3. Of particular note is the shape of the NH3 breakthrough curves. Whereas the curve through BSC is relatively sharp, going from 0 to over 200 mg/m3 in less than 5 min, the curve through UiO-66-NH2-5K is much broader, taking approximately 10 min over the same concentration range. This behavior is typical of a material with high capacity but mass-transfer limitations of NH3 going from the bulk phase (contaminated air stream) to the sorbent. One explanation for this behavior is the difference in particle size distribution (Table S2, Supporting Information). As noted above, the average particle size of the UiO-66-NH2-5K sample is larger than that of the BSC material. The other potential cause of the diffusional limitations in UiO-66-NH2-5K is the pore size distribution. Whereas activated carbons generally have a heterogeneous pore structure consisting of meso- and macropores,(36) which act as transport pores for toxic chemicals, the UiO-66 materials are almost completely microporous, providing physical limitations to diffusion rates. Differential and cumulative pore volumes for the BSC and baseline UiO-66-NH2 material are shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). In all, however, the capacity for NH3 removal is sufficiently high on UiO-66-NH2 to warrant further investigation.Figure 8. NH3 breakthrough of UiO-66-NH2-5K compared to BSC. The challenge concentration was 1000 mg/m3, and the RH was 15%.Figure 9. CNCl breakthrough of UiO-66-NH2-5K compared to BSC. The challenge concentration was 4000 mg/m3, and the RH was 15%.Similarly, the CNCl breakthrough curves indicate that the BSC provides much better removal than the UiO-66-NH2-5K material. Whereas BSC provides a CNCl breakthrough time of 14.8 min to 8 mg/m3 (see Table 5), the chemical immediately penetrates the MOF, indicating that the amount of MOF used is less than the critical bed depth required to sufficiently remove CNCl. Although it is apparent that the MOF is capable of removing CNCl, the removal mechanism (adsorption + reaction) is sufficiently slow to cause breakthrough, once again likely due to diffusional limitations. With the larger particles, the critical bed depth under the conditions studied is likely significantly larger, resulting in immediate breakthrough. Furthermore, the kinetic diameter of CNCl (approximately 5.6 \u00c5)(37) is similar to that of the UiO-66-NH2 pore aperture,(38) which likely further inhibits diffusion. Yet, even with this immediate breakthrough, the UiO-66-NH2 shows significant capacity similar to that of the BSC, as the breakthrough curves to higher concentration levels are quite similar.Table 5.

It was determined that surface area and porosity decreased slightly at pressures up to 25000 psi, after which the structure degraded significantly. NH3 and CNCl removals also dropped significantly as pressure increased. The material pressed at 5000 psi was scaled to large quantities for breakthrough testing against NH3 and CNCl. The results indicate that the material provides significant capacity but lacks the mass-transfer kinetics necessary for use in a filter. This result likely stems from a lack of a hierarchical pore structure, as UiO-66-NH2 is very microporous in nature, and further studies must be conducted to enhance diffusion characteristics of the material.
