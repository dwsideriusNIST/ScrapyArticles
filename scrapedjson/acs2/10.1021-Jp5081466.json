Currently, limited knowledge is available on the effects of crystal size on framework flexibility and structural transition for ZIFs/metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) and other porous solids. Sakata and co-workers(15) studied a shape memory effect of flexible crystalline porous coordination polymers (PCPs) as a result of crystal downsizing. Kumari and co-workers(16) observed substantial differences in sorption capacity within micro- and nano-sized ZIF-8 crystals. A fundamental understanding of such effects may be critical to the design of nano-sized nanoporous materials with desirable properties. One useful example of a structural transition in a ZIF is the change of crystal structure of ZIF-8 induced by adsorption of N2.(8) This transition causes an appreciable \u201cstep\u201d in the N2 adsorption isotherm of ZIF-8. Similar transitions in other ZIFs can be induced by adsorption or other factors such as external pressure,(17) although it is important to note that the presence of a step in the isotherm is not necessarily evidence of a structural transition, and vice versa.In addition to experimental studies, several groups have used molecular simulations to examine framework flexibility and structural transitions in the bulk ZIF-8 framework. Haldoupis et al. combined ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and classical simulations to predict the effect of framework flexibility on the diffusion of CH4 and CO2 in ZIF-8.(18) Several groups have developed classical force fields to describe the static and dynamic properties of ZIF-8 on the basis of the AMBER and DREIDING force fields.(19-22) Zhang et al. recently developed a classical force field to describe the N2-induced structural transition of ZIF-8.(23) These authors demonstrated that this force field was able to accurately reproduce the structural transition first observed experimentally by Fairen-Jimenez et al.(8) using hybrid grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations.The osmotic framework adsorbed solution theory (OFAST) is a useful simulation method that has been used to study structural deformations in flexible nanoporous solids.(24, 25) OFAST predicts the equilibrium-favored system on the basis of adsorption simulations in a series of metastable frameworks. This technique has been a critical tool for understanding and predicting adsorption-induced structural transitions of flexible MOFs. All previous applications of OFAST have been to bulk materials. Some recent work examining the spatial extent of adsorption stresses in nanoporous crystals has focused on introducing coarse-grained simulation techniques.(26) Although this work has been successful in describing transitions in bulk materials, it is unclear how these techniques could be extended to include surface effects in nanoparticles.In this study, we investigated the effect of crystal size on the structural transitions of ZIF-8 by applying OFAST to simulate an entire ZIF-8 nanoparticle. To test the validity of this approach experimentally, 10 ZIF-8 samples with distinct crystal diameter (10 nm\u2013324 \u03bcm) were synthesized. The samples were characterized with N2 physisorption, and experimental isotherms were compared with OFAST-simulated N2 physisorption isotherms of ZIF-8 nanoparticles and the ZIF-8 bulk phase.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionSimulation DetailsExperimental MethodsResults and DiscussionConclusionReferences2 Simulation DetailsThe ZIF-8 nanoparticle used in our simulations was constructed by clipping a sphere from the center of a large simulation cell of the bulk structure, as shown in Figure 1. This procedure was motivated by the roughly spherical shape of the smallest nanoparticles observed using electron microscopy (see Figure 2, below) and the qualitatively similar XRD patterns of these particles and the bulk material (Supporting Information (SI), Figure S4). We should note that our model can handle other crystal shapes and orientations as long as the crystal structure is known. Our simulated nanoparticle has half the diameter of the smallest experimental crystal; this was the largest size that was readily feasible. We will show below that this model is able to effectively reproduce trends in the adsorption isotherm observed for varying particle sizes. Any under-coordinated imidazole groups (metal atoms) at the surface of the nanoparticle were terminated with \u201ccapping\u201d hydrogen atoms (imidazole groups). Recent studies have found evidence for NH-terminated imidazole groups at the surface of Zn(Im)2-containing systems as well as a combination of N groups, OH groups, and under-coordinated Zn atoms.(27, 28) We assume that any unstable ions at the surface will quickly terminate with hydroxyl or imidazole ions present in the aqueous synthesis conditions. The effect of different nanoparticle surface terminations on adsorption uptake is discussed in more detail later.Figure 1. Schematic comparison of the (a) nonperiodic nanoparticle and (b) periodic bulk ZIF-8 systems prior to force field energy minimization, shown to scale. The unit cells comprising the simulation cell of the bulk structure are bounded by dotted blue lines and are superimposed in the nanoparticle to guide the eye. The domain over which grand canonical Monte Carlo moves were performed for both structures is indicated by a solid line. The C atoms of the framework are shown in gray, N in blue, H in white, and Zn as purple tetrahedra.Adsorption isotherms for the nanoparticle and bulk systems were simulated using GCMC simulations as implemented in RASPA.(29) All structures were force field energy-minimized prior to these simulations. The GCMC simulations used an equilibration (production) period of 1 \u00d7 104 (2.5 \u00d7 104) cycles. The GCMC moves were restricted to a spherical shell encompassing the entire nanoparticle and included an additional 1.0 nm shell to capture adsorption in extracrystalline space. Any GCMC move that allowed an adsorbate to leave the system was rejected. The amount of adsorbed molecules was calculated using a fixed cutoff that was approximately equal to the radius of the particle.The bonded and nonbonded force field parameters used to describe the bulk structure were the same as those used in the study of Zhang et al.(23) We assumed that these parameters are able to describe the interactions in the nanoparticle, with only minor modifications to include the \u201ccapping\u201d hydrogen atoms. The van der Waals interactions were modeled using a 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential for both systems. The spherical cutoff radius for the LJ interactions was 16.5 \u00c5 (20 \u00c5) for the bulk (nanoparticle). Analytical tail corrections were applied for the bulk system, and the potential was truncated at the cutoff radius for the nanoparticle. The electrostatic interactions were calculated using Ewald summation for the bulk system and a Coulombic pairwise potential with a cutoff radius spanning the entire system for the nanoparticle. Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were applied for the bulk structure, whereas finite boundaries were used for the nanoparticle. We used finite boundary conditions with a Coulombic potential for the nanoparticle because these conditions were found to give results equivalent to those obtained using PBCs and Ewald summation but at reduced computational expense. Additional simulation details are provided in the SI.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionSimulation DetailsExperimental MethodsResults and DiscussionConclusionReferences3 Experimental MethodsDetailed synthesis procedures of all ZIF-8 samples are described in the SI. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to estimate crystal size of synthesized ZIF-8 samples. SEM images were obtained on a LEO 1530 field emission scanning electron microscope (LEO Electron Microscopy, Cambridge, UK). TEM images were obtained on a FEI Tecnai F30 high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 300 kV. Electron microscope images are shown in Figure 2, which reveal (truncated) rhombic dodecahedron-shaped microcrystals and spherical nanocrystals. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was used to confirm the crystal structure of synthesized ZIF-8 samples. XRD data were collected on a Phillips X\u2019Pert X-ray diffractometer (using Cu K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 0.154 nm at 45 kV and 40 mA). Experiments were carried out scanning from 2\u03b8 = 5\u00b0 to 40\u00b0. PXRD patterns of the synthesized ZIF-8 samples are shown in Figure S4, which are well consistent with the simulated pattern.Figure 2. Electron microscope images of synthesized ZIF-8 samples: (A) 10 nm, (B) 18 nm, (C) 52 nm, (D) 92 nm, (E) 540 nm, (F) 1 \u03bcm, (G) 3.4 \u03bcm, (H) 7.6 \u03bcm, (I) 15.8 \u03bcm, and (J) 324 \u03bcm. Panels (C), (I), and (J) are reproduced with permission from ref 11.N2 physisorption isotherms (77 K) were measured with an ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA). Samples were degassed at 120\u2013150 \u00b0C for 12\u201316 h prior to measurements. Figure S5 shows N2 physisorption isotherms of the ZIF-8 samples. N2 molecules sorbed in the windows through the multilayer formation and micropore filling mechanism at low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.01), as shown by the dramatic increase in sorption capacity. As relative pressure increased, sorption continued on the crystal external surfaces until a \u201cplateau\u201d was reached for micro-sized crystals.(30) A further increase in sorption capacity took place for nano-sized crystals close to the saturation pressure (P/P0 = 1), which was believed to be condensation in the mesopores and macropores formed by agglomeration of nano-sized crystals. Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface areas and micropore volumes were obtained from the N2 physisorption isotherms and are listed in Table S5. The BET surface area was analyzed on the basis of the consistency criteria,(31) which was comparable (with the exception of the 10, 18, and 52 nm samples) with the value of the commercial sample by BASF.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionSimulation DetailsExperimental MethodsResults and DiscussionConclusionReferences4 Results and DiscussionWe applied the OFAST method to study the structural transition induced by N2 adsorption in the bulk and nanoparticle structures by comparing results in the ZIF-8 low-loading (LL) and high-loading (HL) structures defined in the earlier work of Fairen-Jimenez et al.(8) Our model does not account for kinetic barriers or inhomogeneity between the LL and HL phases, although these effects might be captured using a mesoscopic model similar to the one proposed by Triguero et al.(26) As shown in Figure 3, our OFAST calculations predict that N2 adsorption induces a structural transition in bulk ZIF-8 at a relative pressure (P/P0) of \u223c5 \u00d7 10\u20133. This value is in good agreement with the hybrid GCMC results of Zhang et al.,(23) which predicted that the transition occurs over a P/P0 range of 5 \u00d7 10\u20133\u20131 \u00d7 10\u20132. It is important to note that the agreement between the simulated and experimental bulk material (Figure 3) is not unexpected; this transition pressure was used to parametrize the Zhang et al. force field.(23) It should be noted that we observed another minor step in the experimental isotherm of the bulk materials at P/P0 \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u20133, which was consistent with the results of a previous study.(32) However, we were not able to simulate this effect using the Zhang et al. force field.Figure 3. OFAST-simulated and experimental adsorption isotherms for N2 in the ZIF-8 bulk and nanoparticle (NP) frameworks at T = 77 K.Our results in Figure S2 show the grand potential \u03a9 of the bulk ZIF-8 framework as a function of P/P0. These calculations predict that the LL form of ZIF-8 is the equilibrium-favored structure at zero loading, in agreement with experimental observations. The calculated difference in free energy per formula unit between the empty LL and HL structures of ZIF-8 with the Zhang et al. force field(23) is \u223c1.8 kJ mol\u20131 Zn\u20131, which is \u223c3 kT at T = 77 K. At high N2 pressures the HL system becomes lower in free energy relative to the LL system due to the increased guest molecule loading in this system. This effect provides the thermodynamic driving force for the system to undergo the transition from the LL to HL structures.Our simulated and experimental N2 adsorption isotherms show that the adsorption uptake in the nanoparticle follows a substantially different trend than the bulk, as shown in Figure 3. The isotherm for the nanoparticle follows a Type II-like isotherm. The experimental isotherm also shows that capillary condensation occurs in the mesopores between the nanoparticles near P/P0 = 1, although this effect is neglected in our simulations. The N2 adsorption uptake in the nanoparticle is lower than in the bulk on a framework mass basis. It should be noted that this was contradictory with the results reported by Kumari et al.,(16) who observed much lower sorption capacity in micro-sized ZIF-8 crystals than nano-sized ZIF-8 crystals. It is speculated that such contradiction was due to the use of DMF for synthesis and washing the micro-sized ZIF-8 sample in the referenced work, which possibly led to partial activation.(6) Figure 3 shows that our simulated isotherms are in reasonable agreement with experiments until P/P0 approaches \u223c1 \u00d7 10\u20131. It is unclear why the adsorption uptake in the Henry\u2019s region is higher in the experimental d = 10 nm nanoparticle compared to the bulk material, although this effect was also observed in the study by Sakata et al.(15) It is clear that the simulation data show a step in adsorption isotherm at P/P0 \u2248 1 \u00d7 10\u20131, while the experimental data show no evidence of such a transition. It was possible that the structural transition on the 10 nm sample was too subtle to be experimentally observed due to limited device sensitivity. Regardless of this disagreement, we still find that this method is able to describe the experimentally observed trend of transition pressure versus particle size.As mentioned previously, we were not able to simulate particle sizes larger than d = 5 nm due to computational limitations. However, we were able to evaluate the effect of decreasing particle sizes on the simulated transition behavior. Figure 4 shows the OFAST-simulated N2 adsorption isotherms at T = 77 K for the bulk material, d = 5 and 2.5 nm nanoparticles. We observe that the smallest simulated nanoparticle (d = 2.5 nm) does not exhibit a step in the isotherm over the entire range of P/P0. This result is similar to our experimental observation that a step is observed for the d = 20 nm particle but absent for the d = 10 nm particle and demonstrates that the transition pressure is very sensitive to particle size for smaller nanoparticles.Figure 4. OFAST-simulated adsorption isotherms for N2 in ZIF-8 bulk and d = 5.0 and 2.5 nm particles at T = 77 K.Although we assumed that the bulk material and nanoparticle have similar compositions, we also tested the sensitivity of our simulation results to alternate nanoparticle surface terminations. To examine this effect, we replaced the imidazole groups on the surface of the d = 5.0 nm nanoparticle with less bulky hydroxyl groups using the procedure described in the SI. As shown in Figure 5, the hydroxyl-terminated surface exhibits a similar transition pressure compared to the imidazole-terminated surface. This result is reasonable because the surface functional groups are far from the center of the nanoparticle, where the adsorption uptake is maximal. Therefore, we expect that the effect of surface termination has a minor impact on the trends observed in our simulation analysis.Figure 5. OFAST-simulated adsorption isotherms for N2 in ZIF-8 bulk and d = 5.0 nm imidazole- and d = 5.0 nm hydroxyl-terminated (NP-OH) particles at T = 77 K.To better understand the differences in adsorption uptake in the nanoparticle and the bulk materials, we partitioned the adsorption uptake in the nanoparticle into \u201cbulk-like\u201d and surface regions. The bulk-like region was defined as any N2 molecule lying within a radial distance of approximately one bulk ZIF-8 unit cell from the center of the nanoparticle. We observed that the adsorption uptake in the surface region is negligible compared to that at the interior, at P/P0 < 10\u20133 (Figure S3). The preferential adsorption in the bulk-like region at low pressures is due to the increased number of neighboring framework atoms compared to the surface. This effect leads to a decrease in nitrogen heat of adsorption at infinite dilution of \u223c1.5 kT at the surface relative to the interior. The suppressed adsorption uptake at the surface results in a lower transition pressure compared to that at the bulk-like region (Table S4). This effect results in a reduced thermodynamic driving force for the transition in the nanoparticle over the entire range of bulk fluid pressures compared to the bulk.Our calculations confirm that the different transition behavior was due to adsorption effects rather than structural properties of the nanoparticle compared to the bulk. Although the nanoparticle does not have a precisely defined formula unit as in the bulk structure, we can estimate the free energy difference between the LL and HL structures as \u223c1.9 kJ mol\u20131 Zn\u20131 in the nanoparticle. This value is similar to that observed for the bulk, indicating that this energy is not the primary driving force behind the difference in transition behavior. Moreover, an experimental Williamson\u2013Hall analysis (Figure S7) confirmed that the experimental nanocrystals did not exhibit differences in crystal strain from the bulk.To further understand the effects of crystal size on structural transition of the material, an additional eight ZIF-8 samples were synthesized (Figure 2). Experimental N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of all ten ZIF-8 samples are plotted individually in Figure S5. Adsorption isotherms are also shown in Figure 6A with magnification of the relative pressure range 10\u20133\u201310\u20131 in Figure 6B. A closer examination of isotherms in this range revealed very differently shaped isotherms. For 324 and 15.8 \u03bcm ZIF-8 samples, the structural transition featured a sharp step in the isotherm. As particle size decreased, this step became less defined and the structural transition gradually shifted to higher relative pressures. As the particle size started to fall into the nano regime (i.e., d < 100 nm), the structure transition became much less obvious. A similar effect was observed by Sakata et al.,(15) although it was unclear whether their transition was suppressed by kinetic or thermodynamic limitations. For the smallest sample with d = 10 nm, the isotherm was completely devoid of an observable step. Additionally, magnification at the Henry\u2019s region is shown in Figure S6; however, no size-dependent features were observed at this region.Figure 6. (A) Experimental N2 adsorption isotherms. (B) Experimentally observed crystal-size-dependent structural transitions. Isotherms are artificially offset for clarity.Unfortunately, simulating N2 physisorption isotherms of intermediate crystal sizes (18 nm, 52 nm, 92 nm, 540 nm, 1 \u03bcm, 3.4 \u03bcm, 7.6 \u03bcm, and 15.8 \u03bcm) would be overly computationally expensive. As a result, we were not able to directly compare OFAST-simulated isotherms with experimental data. Based on our findings for the 5 nm nanoparticle, we applied a simple core\u2013shell model to examine the trend in transition pressure versus particle size. We assumed that the surface for each structure consisted of a shell the size of the smallest particle for which a transition was observed surrounding the interior of the particle. The transition pressure for each crystal size was a volume-weighted value between the transition pressures for the largest and smallest crystal size for which a transition was observed in experiments and simulations. As shown in Figure 7, this model gives reasonable agreement with the trends observed experimentally. We also observe that the difference in transition behavior compared to the bulk becomes more pronounced with smaller particle sizes, which was also shown in Figure 4. The discrepancies between the model and experiments may be due to differences in particle shape versus crystal size which are not included in the model. The disagreement between simulated and experimental transition behavior is likely due to a combination of experimental error and inaccuracy of the force field, which was parametrized on the basis of adsorption uptake in the bulk material. Overall, these results give further indication that the effect of crystal size on transition pressure is due to the influence of the surface on the adsorption uptake in each crystal.Figure 7. Transition pressure versus inverse crystal size from experiments and using a simple core\u2013shell model with experimental and simulated transition pressures.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionSimulation DetailsExperimental MethodsResults and DiscussionConclusionReferences5 ConclusionIn this study, we investigated the crystal-size-dependent structural transition of ZIF-8 induced by N2 adsorption using simulations and experiments. We developed a new methodology to simulate the adsorption and transition behavior of entire ZIF-8 particles at nanometer length scales. Our simulations predict that the structural transition occurs at a significantly higher pressure in the nanoparticle compared to the bulk. Our models show that this is caused by a destabilizing effect of the nanoparticle surface which results in reduced guest molecule loadings in this region. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that our models do not depend on surface termination but are strongly dependent on particle size for the smallest particles. We also developed a simple core\u2013shell model to explain the trend in transition pressure versus particle size on length scales inaccessible to simulations. These models successfully predicted the trends in transition behavior observed using crystal-size-dependent experimental measurements for this system. The methods developed in our study should be useful for understanding thermodynamically controlled crystal-size-dependent structural transitions in porous materials in general.
