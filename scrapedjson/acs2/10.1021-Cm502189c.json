MOFs tend to possess complex pore topologies, typically 3D in nature, allowing exchange of adsorbed species and pathways through the material.(7) These pores are typically in the 1\u20132 nm size range and are tailorable through judicious selection of components used.(8) Conversely, CNTs contain only a 1D channel and have relatively poor adsorption behavior due to their weak interactions with gases.(9) The uptake properties can be enhanced by incorporation of sites with stronger affinities for gaseous guests, such as by doping metal ions into the nanotubes.(10) Nanotubes also have a lack of size control below ca. 1 nm, thereby giving poor size-based selectivity, and there is difficulty in aligning the tubes in bulk samples in order to take advantage of any potential separation applications.Coordination polymers, of which MOFs represent a significant subset,(11) can be rationally designed as proposed by Robson.(12) Some significant advantages of MOFs with regards to providing strong host\u2212guest interactions are their ability to be synthetically modified to expose bare metal sites,(13) chemical reduction of the framework by metalation, cation exchange,(14) or the addition of internal pendant groups.(15-17) MOFs are also able to display pore-size control that cannot be reliably achieved with CNTs and that has been shown to be very beneficial for CO2 capture if pore size is complementary to the kinetic diameter of CO2.(18-21) It has been postulated recently that it should be possible to reliably access metal\u2013organic materials (MOMs) that display nanotube-like structure and behavior, which have been termed SWMONTs (single-walled metal organic nanotubes).(22) While reports of tubular metal\u2013organic materials are relatively rare, an alternative strategy of great promise is the synthesis of more traditional MOFs with arrays of nonintersecting 1D channels. Size control is again important, and there is currently considerable interest in ultramicroporous MOMs, which possess channels with internal diameters <0.7 nm (i.e., smaller than an N2 bilayer).(23) Such small pores can lead to highly selective sorption by size discrimination and display unique sorption properties, including significant pore-blocking at low temperatures and quantum effects on guest sorption.(3, 24-29)We report here a unique mixed-valent copper framework containing ultramicroporous, nonintersecting 1D channels in two directions with an unprecedented density of vacant CuII sites embedded within the walls. The material has been shown by neutron powder diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to host CO2 in tight confines close to these metal sites, with guest orientation largely dictated by the size of the channels, and to display size-dependent adsorption of CO2 over CH4.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesExperimental SectionSynthesisK(cdm) was prepared according to a literature procedure.(30) K(cdm) (240 mg, 1.63 mmol) was almost completely dissolved in methanol (30 mL) with the aid of sonication. To this was added a methanolic solution (3 mL) of anhydrous CuCl2 (216 mg, 1.61 mmol). Upon the addition of the green CuCl2 solution, the remaining suspended K(cdm) was dissolved to give a deep orange solution. Dark orange crystals of solvated [Cu3(cdm)4] (173 mg, 0.252 mmol, 62% yield) formed on the walls of the reaction vessel over a period of 2 days.

Data were collected using a Bruker X8 Apex2 diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Mo\u2013K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5). The data collection temperature was maintained at 123 K using an open-flow N2 cryostream. Data reduction was carried out using the Bruker Apex2 software suite.(31) The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-2013.(32) Refinement was carried out against F2 using SHELXL-2013.(33) All non-hydrogen atoms were refined using an anisotropic model. Hydrogen atoms belonging to the amide group were placed in idealized X-ray positions and refined using a riding model. Solvent coordinated to the Cu(II) was modeled as 50:50 H2O/MeOH. Additional refinement details are supplied in the Supporting Information.Crystal data for [Cu3(cdm)4(H2O)(MeOH)]: C17H13Cu3N12O6, M = 672.01, orange block, 0.140 \u00d7 0.120 \u00d7 0.120 mm3, I4\u03052d space group (No. 122), V = 2737.7(3) \u00c53, Z = 4, Dc = 1.630 g/cm3, F000 = 1336, 2\u03b8max = 55.0\u00b0, 5238 reflections collected, 1561 unique (Rint = 0.0313).

CCDC 1000273.Neutron Powder DiffractionNeutron powder diffraction data were collected on the high-intensity neutron diffractometer, Wombat (OPAL, ANSTO, Australia).(34) Prior to neutron powder diffraction measurement and gas dosing, 1.119 g of desolvated [Cu3(cdm)4] was transferred to a cylindrical vanadium can (internal diameter of ca. 6 mm) inside a helium-filled glovebox equipped with water and oxygen monitors. The sample cell was connected to a custom-designed gas-delivery center-stick and inserted into a top-loading cryofurnace. Temperature control at the sample was achieved using cartridge heaters and silicon-diode temperature sensors at the top and bottom of the cell. The gas-delivery line was also temperature-controlled in order to avoid freezing CO2 inside the tube, so that the sample could be left in place throughout the experiment without the requirement of warming the entire cryofurnace between gas doses. An initial diffraction pattern was collected on the evacuated sample at 15 K to be used as a structural reference point from which subsequent data for the CO2-dosed sample could be analyzed. The sample was then warmed to 300 K prior to dosing with a known amount of CO2, before being slowly cooled to the measurement temperature of 15 K, all the while ensuring that the temperature was kept above the boiling/sublimation point of CO2 at the current pressure. By 150 K the pressure reading was zero, indicating that all CO2 had been absorbed by the sample. No evidence of frozen CO2 was observed in the diffraction patterns. The total cooling time was approximately 1 h, with the intention of ensuring diffusion of the CO2 molecules to their thermodynamic equilibrium positions and minimizing random disorder of guest molecules prior to the diffraction measurement. Thirty minutes of diffraction data were acquired for each dose using an area detector in the angular range 17\u00b0 < 2\u03b8 < 137\u00b0 with an incident neutron wavelength of 2.4145(3) \u00c5, determined using an Al2O3 standard reference material (NIST SRM 676). A correction was applied to the Debye\u2013Scherrer ring curvature before data reduction.Rietveld analysis and difference Fourier analysis of the diffraction data was carried out using GSAS and EXPGUI,(35, 36) with a pseudo-Voigt peak shape and 16-term shifted Chebyshev background function. VESTA was used for visualization of the crystal structure and nuclear density isosurfaces.(37) Following refinement of the guest-free structure, this was used together with the data from the CO2-loaded sample to generate Fourier difference maps of residual nuclear density. Further details are provided in the Supporting Information.CalculationsThe static cavity size distribution was calculated using the geometric sizing algorithm using atomic coordinates from the single crystal data.(38) There is a dominant cavity size of around 3.9 \u00c5 that represents the main channels. Using molecular dynamics (MD) with generic UFF, the flexibility of the channel size was investigated over one nanosecond at 123 K with fixed cell volume. The window size was defined as the maximum size of a spherical probe allowed to pass through the structure.(39) All DFT calculations were performed using VASP 5.2 with the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional and Gaussian smearing of partial occupancies (see Supporting Information for full experimental details).Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesResults and DiscussionSynthesis and StructureThe mixed-valent CuI/CuII coordination polymer [Cu3(cdm)4(MeOH)(H2O)] was synthesized by reaction of K(cdm), where cdm is the dinitrile anion C(CN)2(CONH2)\u2212, with CuCl2 in aerobic conditions following from our extensive work on discrete coordination complexes using this ligand(40) (full synthetic details in Supporting Information). Mixed-valent coordination polymers of copper are not unknown, with precedents typically being materials containing cyanide, halide, azide, or thiocyanate bridging ligands. Powder diffraction confirms that the synthesis gives a phase-pure product (see Supporting Information). Elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicate that both water and methanol are present within the as-synthesized material. In part these solvents are coordinated, although the proportion of coordinated MeOH/H2O is difficult to determine crystallographically as the solvent lies on a crystallographic 4-fold axis.The material crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4\u03052d with a single cdm ligand in the asymmetric unit, the CuII atoms residing on a rotoinversion site and the CuI atoms lying on rotation axes. The CuI atoms are tetrahedral and are exclusively coordinated by nitrile groups. The CuII atoms are octahedral with four \u03baO-cdm ligands in the equatorial positions and coordinated solvent, a mixture of MeOH and H2O, in the axial positions. Both metals therefore act as four-connecting nodes. The cdm ligand is a three-connecting node giving the structure an overall self-penetrating (82.10)4(83.103)2(85.10) topology (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The closely related anions dicyanamide (dca) and tricyanomethanide (tcm) are both known to form 3D structures in binary complexes, although in these instances the metal coordination spheres are filled completely by the ligands and typically give close-packed structures.(40) The mixed nitrogen/oxygen donor groups in cdm, alongside the mixed CuI/CuII present in the structure, mean that the metal/donor preferences are ideal for easily removed solvent to be present in the axial CuII sites, thereby allowing guest-accessible pores. The short distance between the donor atoms is ideal for forming ultramicroporous channels.Nonintersecting, nanotube-like channels run through the structure parallel to the crystallographic a and b axes (Figure 1). In the as-synthesized material, axially coordinated solvent on the CuII atoms protrudes into these narrow channels, effectively blocking them for any application. The most striking feature of these 1D channels is the high density of vacant CuII coordination sites that is present once the solvent has been removed, with open-metal sites known to enhance interactions with gases.(41) These metal sites occupy opposing walls of the channels and are spaced apart by ca. 11.2 \u00c5 along one wall. Taking into account the two CuII-lined walls this gives a vacant metal site every 5.6 \u00c5 along the channels, with the closest Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distance being 7.8 \u00c5 (cf. 8.0 \u00c5 in the narrow \u201cwindows\u201d in the structure of HKUST-1).(42) Further potential points of interaction for guest molecules are provided by the NH2 group of the ligands, which protrudes very slightly into the channels at a similar spacing. The extremely small size of the channels is obtained by the use of the cdm ligand, which is itself small and sterically undemanding, with only single atoms as points of coordination to the metals. Thus, this ligand has advantages over larger, more complicated ligands that rely on bulkier coordinating groups, such as pyridine, which crowd the immediate metal coordination sphere. The small bridging distance between the coordinating groups of the cdm ligand, with the three Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu distances around one ligand in the range 6.36\u20138.26 \u00c5, is ideal for forming an ultramicroporous material.Figure 1. Ultramicroporous structure of [Cu3(cdm)4] contains nonintersecting channels with a dynamic diameter fluctuating around 3.5 \u00c5, intermediate between the kinetic diameters of CH4 and CO2, and significantly smaller than the smallest reported CNT.The static cavity size distribution for these channels was calculated using a geometric sizing algorithm, showing a dominant cavity size of ca. 3.9 \u00c5 that represents the main channels in the structure (Figure 1).(43) The flexibility of these channels was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations over 1 ns with the generic universal force field (UFF, Figure 1).(44) The window size in the MD simulations was defined by the maximum size of a spherical probe that is allowed to pass through the channel. Over the course of this simulation the window size fluctuated around 3.5 \u00c5, suggesting that the material may have a potential sieving mechanism as the channel size lies intermediate between that of CO2 (kinetic diameter = 3.3 \u00c5) and CH4 (kinetic diameter = 3.87 \u00c5). The remarkably small internal size of these channels is significantly smaller than those in the ultramicroporous salen-derived MOF of Chen et al. (5.6 \u00d7 12.0 \u00c5), which also contains vacant CuII coordination sites,(24) and marginally smaller than those in the SIFSIX-3 MOM (ca. 3.8 \u00c5 at low temperatures).(19, 25, 45)Gas Sorption ExperimentsThe coordinated solvent molecules, and uncoordinated solvent within the channels, can be removed by treatment of the material with supercritical CO2 (scCO2), well-known as an effective method of MOF activation,(46) to give the desolvated framework [Cu3(cdm)4]. Retention of crystallinity upon desolvation was demonstrated by neutron powder diffraction (NPD, Figure 2).Figure 2. Rietveld refinement (red) against NPD data (black) for guest-free [Cu3(cdm)4] at 15 K after activation by supercritical CO2.Studies of the gas sorption properties of the material were conducted for CO2, CH4, H2, and Ar (Figure 3; full details in Supporting Information). At 273 K almost twice as much CO2 is taken up as CH4 (46 cm3 g\u20131 vs 25 cm3 g\u20131 at 1000 mbar) bearing out the prediction from the MD simulations that the size of the pore may lead to sieving or selective adsorption between these two gases. While increased uptake of CO2 is not unexpected for most MOFs,(1, 3) it is uncommon for the cavity diameter to be intermediate between that of the two gases. Uptake of hydrogen and argon are negligible at 77 and 87 K, respectively, with nitrogen also not adsorbed at similar temperatures. Such sorption behavior is known for ultramicroporous MOFs/MOMs.(3, 32) The adsorption kinetics are also remarkably slow, with CO2 sorption at 273 K requiring 68 h to reach saturation (Supporting Information, Figure S12) giving further evidence of sieving kinetics even at relatively high temperatures.Figure 3. Experimental (icons) and simulated (solid lines) sorption traces highlighting the difference in behavior between CO2 and CH4 and negligible uptake of Ar and H2.Predictions of the adsorption behavior were conducted using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations (Figure 3). These simulations overestimate the experimental isotherms although the general trends that are observed are captured. It appears that the size, shape, and charge composition of CO2 is much more favorable for adsorption within the channels than CH4, with twice as many molecules of CO2 being taken in. Calculations of experimental enthalpies are unreliable due to step-like behavior at low pressures, indicative of the tube-like adsorption (see Supporting Information, Figure S11). The predicted and experimentally determined uptake of H2 is less than 1 cm3 g\u20131. The postulated reason for this low uptake is a quantum effect that occurs due to nanoscale confinement of light gases. The enormous reduction in predicted H2 uptake is accounted for by incorporating the quantum Feynman\u2013Hibbs potential into calculations (see Supporting Information, Figure S13).(47, 48) Similar behavior is observed for other ultramicroporous materials, including the recent NOTT-300 material, which has somewhat larger (ca. 6.5 \u00d7 6.5 \u00c5) pores.(49) The difference in adsorption between CH4 and CO2 in [Cu3(cdm)4] was further investigated by fitting the experimental isotherms with the dual Langmuir expression and utilizing the ideal adsorbed solution (IAST) model to predict mixed-gas isotherms of various industrially relevant compositions (see Supporting Information).(50, 51) These results suggest that there is good selectivity for CO2 over CH4 under the conditions that were modeled, although higher selectivities are known.(52)Neutron Powder DiffractionTo explore the host\u2013guest interactions within the material, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments with in situ gas loading were performed using the Wombat diffractometer at ANSTO.(34) An initial diffraction pattern from scCO2-activated and evacuated [Cu3(cdm)4] at 15 K was used as a structural reference point for analysis of the CO2-loaded structures with Rietveld refinement giving a low R value with no evidence of residual solvent (Figure 2). The sample was treated with two successive doses of CO2 with loadings of 1.00 and 2.00 CO2/[Cu3(cdm)4]. Slow uptake during the final part of the second gas dose indicated that the sample was reaching its maximum CO2 capacity. The final quantity of adsorbed CO2 was equivalent to 73 cm3 g\u20131 at STP, which, due to the lower temperature involved, is considerably greater than the uptake measured at 1 bar and 273 K. No new reflections were observed in the CO2-loaded diffraction patterns, indicating that the original symmetry is preserved.Fourier-difference analysis of the NPD data revealed two CO2 sites within the channels (Figure 4). Site A, which at the 1 CO2/[Cu3(cdm)4] loading level contains the most nuclear density, is close to the open CuII site with the residual density suggestive of CO2 lying side-on to the metal. CO2 typically binds in an end-on fashion,(53-55) but in the present case this arrangement would align poorly with the geometry of the channel, whereas the side-on orientation enables increased interaction with the pore walls. Site B is located in the narrower part of the channel, midway between two diagonally opposite open CuII sites. The constricted pore environment does not appear to allow the geometric arrangement necessary for a strong interaction between CO2 molecules and the NH2 groups, and no significant residual nuclear density was found in their vicinity.Figure 4. Two distinct adsorption sites in CO2-loaded [Cu3(cdm)4], as determined by the combination of NPD and DFT calculations. The labeled distances are from the Rietveld refinement for [Cu3(cdm)4]\u00b71CO2. Because of the short distance between the two sites, both cannot be simultaneously filled as shown.The somewhat diffuse nuclear density at these sites indicates some positional disorder of the CO2 molecules, despite confinement by the small channels. A single partially occupied CO2 molecule in the side-on arrangement was satisfactorily modeled at site A, with refined occupancies of 0.35 and 0.40 for the C and O atoms, respectively. A single 0.15 occupancy C atom was modeled at the center of the residual density at site B, but as a consequence of the disorder, the corresponding oxygen atoms of the CO2 are not readily located. The relative ease of locating this C atom implies that the orientation of the CO2, rather than its center of mass, is disordered. The combined C occupancies at the two sites are in good agreement with the dosed amount for both loading levels (Table 1). The occupancy of site A increases only slightly at higher loading, indicating that it is nearly saturated by the first dose, while the site B occupancy increases significantly. The overall result is roughly half-filling of each site at the higher CO2 loading.Table 1. Refined Occupancies and Distances from the Nearest CuII Site for the Two Unique CO2 Adsorption Sites in [Cu3(cdm)4] (1)\u00a0CO2 occupancy\u00a0Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C\u00a0(\u00c5)CO2:1 dosedsite\u00a0Aasite\u00a0BbCO2:1 foundsite Asite B0000\u00a0\u00a01.000.37(6)0.147(29)1.04(13)3.0465(5)3.8788(4)2.000.43(8)0.55(6)1.97(20)3.0926(6)3.8923(4)aBased on C and O occupancies.bBased on C occupancy.DFT-based MD simulations at 100 K were performed to validate the NPD experimental results and determine the orientation of the CO2 molecules. The time-averaged site A position in the MD simulation is in good agreement with the NPD data with CO2 side-on to the metal. The simulation shows CO2 molecules moving back and forth between sites A and B and provides strong evidence that the preferred orientation of the CO2 molecule at both sites is along the direction of the channel. The motion is rapid even at 100 K, with each CO2 molecule switching sites an average of three times during the 25 ps simulation, indicating a small energy difference between the two sites. When occupying site B, the CO2 molecules are located with their C atoms midway between the two Cu sites, in good agreement with the C position refined from the NPD data.DFT structure relaxation at 0 K was performed in order to clarify the most energetically favorable arrangement for CO2 molecules at each site. The optimized arrangement for CO2 in site A is in good agreement with the side-on orientation observed in the Rietveld refined NPD structure. The calculated Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C distance of 3.76 \u00c5 is longer than that observed experimentally, likely a result of the fact that DFT does not account for van der Waals interactions.The distance of 7.78 \u00c5 between open CuII sites on either side of site B is comparable to the 7.15 \u00c5 distance between open metal sites in the Co3[Fe(CN)6]2 Prussian blue analogue (PBA) in which a bridging CO2 binding mode was recently established.(56) [Cu3(cdm)4] provides a second example of a CO2 molecule interacting with two bare metal sites, although due to the highly constricted pore environment, the CO2 is unable to adopt a similar binding mode to that in the PBA. All DFT energy minimizations in which a CO2 molecule was initially placed in site B and end-on to the two CuII sites quickly resulted in the molecule returning to an orientation parallel to the channel, indicating that such an end-on bridging mode carries a large energy penalty due to the narrowness of the channels. The channel-aligned arrangement yields a longer M\u2013CO2 distance than in the PBA (M\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7C = 3.89 \u00c5) but enables greater interaction with the channel walls.The simultaneous occupation by CO2 of both an A-site and the adjacent B-site is not energetically favorable due to the short guest\u2013guest distances that this would entail (O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O \u2248 1.0 \u00c5), thereby limiting the CO2 capacity of the framework with each site only ca. 50% occupied at the maximum achieved loading of 2.0 CO2/[Cu3(cdm)4]. The small energy difference (calculated to be 2 kJ mol\u20131) between the two sites means that they both compete relatively equally to bind CO2. Additionally, once 50% occupancy is reached at site A, there is on average one CO2 molecule interacting with each CuII ion, which is likely to alter the energetics of this site and reduce the likelihood of another molecule interacting with the opposite axial site of the same CuII ion. Site B could then become the more favorable site and subsequently fill until the aforementioned steric limit of 2.0 CO2/[Cu3(cdm)4] is reached. This filling regime is supported by the changes in the adsorption site occupation from NPD experiments.Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesConclusionsThe ultramicroporous structure of [Cu3(cdm)4], which contains 0.35 nm nonintersecting channels combined with close vacant CuII sites lining the internal walls, has been shown to display selective gas uptake of CO2. The internal pore size is ideal for improved sorption of CO2 over CH4 with a dynamic diameter intermediate between the kinetic radii of the two gases, although the tight confines of the 1D channel results in slow kinetics. Gas sorption experiments, supported by GCMC simulations, show that the uptake of CO2 is almost twice that of CH4 up to a pressure of 1000 mbar. There is negligible uptake of H2 arising from a quantum effect. Neutron powder diffraction and DFT/MD calculations show the interaction of CO2 at two positions close to the open metal sites, aligned with the direction of the narrow channels. The system demonstrates the influence of free metal sites for CO2 binding, and calculations suggest a significant role of the channel size in separations.
