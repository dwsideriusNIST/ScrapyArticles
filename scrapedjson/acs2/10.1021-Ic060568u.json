Self-assembly of metal ion and/or metal clusters with a variety of organic linkers has not only led to a unique type of porous materials for gas storage, separation, and catalysis but also produced a series of functional materials with special magnetism, nonlinear optics, and luminescence properties.1,2 The research on luminescent MOF materials has been mainly focused on their UV\u2212vis emission,3 while emissive near-IR MOF materials have not yet been explored.4  To incorporate near-IR emissive metal sites such as Er3+, Nd3+, and Yb3+ into their MOF materials, we are particularly interested in tuning their functional properties for potential applications in sensing and optics.5,6 The special advantage of such a MOF approach is to change the concentration of the emissive metal ions/unit volume systematically simply by incorporation of different organic linkers.7 Species containing high-energy C\u2212H, N\u2212H, and/or O\u2212H oscillators (normally existing in the ligands and solvents) significantly quench the metal excited states nonradiatively, leading to decreased luminescence intensities.8 To reduce/eliminate such quenching effects, fully deuterated/fluorinated organic ligands have been incorporated into molecular organolanthanide compounds to enhance their luminescence intensities.9-11 However, the effect of fluorination on the luminescence intensities of lanthanide\u2212organic framework materials has not yet been examined. Herein we report the synthesis  and crystal structures of two erbium\u2212organic frameworks, Er2(BDC)3(DMF)2(H2O)2\u00b7H2O (1) and Er2(BDC-F4)3(DMF)(H2O)\u00b7DMF (2) (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; BDC-F4 = 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate or tetrafluoroterephathlate; DMF = dimethylformamide), and the near-IR\u2212luminescence of the as-synthesized and activated compounds 1, 2, Er2(BDC)3 (1a), and Er2(BDC-F4)3(DMF)\u00b7DMF (2a). The results demonstrate that the luminescence intensity of near-IR emissive MOFs can be significantly enhanced by incorporation of fluorinated organic linkers.      Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionSupporting Information AvailableExperimental Section Materials and Instrumentation. All reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as supplied without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) diffractograms were measured with a Siemens D5005 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu K\u03b1 line (\u03bb = 1.541\u200978 \u00c5) as the incident beam. A Gobel mirror was employed as a monochromator. The sample powder was loaded into a glass holder and leveled with a glass slide before mounting it onto the sample chamber. The specimens were scanned between 4 and 40\u00b0. The scan step width was set to 0.01\u00b0 and the scan rate to 0.01\u00b0/s. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)\u2212differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data were obtained on a TGA G500 V5.3 Build 171 instrument with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under a N2 atmosphere. The Fourier transform IR spectra were recorded by a Nicolet Avatar 360 spectrometer using KBr pellets. Solid samples of compounds 1 and 2 were employed to determine their UV\u2212vis\u2212near-IR absorption spectra, respectively. The UV\u2212vis\u2212near-IR absorption spectra of solid samples were determined by a Hitachi U-4100 spectrometer; the samples were deposited on glass substrates (Corning 2947) by a few drops of a sample\u2212ethanol emulsion followed by the evaporation of ethanol before measurement and then measured by transmittance. Solid samples of compounds 1, 2, 1a, and 2a were used to determine their near-IR\u2212photoluminescence spectra. The near-IR\u2212photoluminescence spectra were determined at room temperature by using a spectrometer equipped with a monochromator (Spex 1269; SPEX Industries Inc., Edison, NJ) and a liquid-N2-cooled Ge detector (EO-817L; Yellow River Systems Inc., USA), together with a 808-nm laser diode (LD) as the excitation source. The solid samples employed in near-IR\u2212photoluminescence spectral measurements were in the form of tablets, which were fabricated in a cavity-like sample holder with the same amount of solids under the same pressure. The measuring geometry and focusing were kept unchanged during near-IR\u2212photoluminescence spectral measurements. In detail, the sample tablets were excited by the LD and the signals were collected by a focal lens whose focus position was the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The axis of the focal lens was leaned against the pump beam at 30\u00b0 and intersected with the pump beam at the front surface of the sample. A filter to reflect the 808-nm pump beam but having high transmittance at longer wavelength was employed in front of the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The integral time was aptly selected according to the photoluminescence intensity, with the spectral resolution of 2 nm for all photoluminescence measurements.

Crystals of 1 and 2 were transferred from a crystallization vessel to a drop of polybutane oil on a microscope slide. Using a nylon loop, a single crystal was than picked and mounted on a Bruker X8 APEX II diffractometer (Mo radiation) in a cold (\u2212100 \u00b0C) N2 stream. Data collection and reduction were done using the Bruker Apex2 software package. The structures were solved by direct methods and subsequent difference Fourier techniques (SHEXLTL). All non-H atoms were refined anisotropically. H atoms were added to a model in their geometrically ideal positions.

Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionSupporting Information AvailableResults and Discussion Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized by solvothermal reactions in mixed solvents of DMF, ethanol, and H2O at a temperature of 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. The formulas of the compounds were determined by single-crystal XRD studies, and the phase purity of the bulk materials was independently confirmed by elemental microanalysis, PXRD, and TGA.  Crystal Structure Descriptions of 1 and 2. As shown in Figure 1a, the structure of 1 consists of binuclear Er clusters as building blocks bridged by two bis-monocarboxylates from two BDCs. Each Er is further coordinated by four O atoms from two bidentate chelating carboxylates of two BDCs, one terminal DMF, and one terminal H2O in a distorted square-antiprism geometry. These binuclear Er clusters can be topologically viewed as octahedral nodes, which are connected by six BDCs to form a three-dimensional (3D) distorted primitive cubic framework (Figure 1b). When the binuclear Er cluster is simplified as a Po atom, the overall structure of 1 is a pair of identical \u03b1-Po nets of Er2(BDC)3(DMF)2(H2O)2 that are mutually interpenetrated with each other to form a doubly interpenetrating 3D framework (Figure 1c). A space-filling model of the structure 1 is shown in Figure 1d, indicating that the pores are filled by another identical framework and coordinated solvent molecules.   Figure 1 Structure of 1 showing (a) the coordination geometry of the secondary building unit of a Er2(BDC)3(DMF)2(H2O)2 cluster, (b) its primitive cubic \u03b1-Po net (H atoms are omitted for clarity; Er, light green; N, blue; O, red; C, gray), (c) a schematic illustration of the doubly interpenetrating frameworks in purple and green [center of the Er2(BDC)3(DMF)2(H2O)2 cluster as the Po node], and (d) its corresponding space-filling representation indicating the formation of a condensed structure.   The structure of 2 is a rod-packing framework12 consisting of two types of Er atoms, both in distorted square-antiprism geometries, which are bridged by two bis-monocarboxylates from two BDC-F4 linkers. As shown in Figure 2a, Er1 (right) is further coordinated by five O atoms from four BDC-F4 linkers and one H2O, while Er2 (left) is fulfilled by five O atoms from four BDC-F4 and one DMF. Each Er atom is further connected with the central symmetrically related Er atom by four BDC-F4 linkers, forming a one-dimensional (1D) rod (Figure 2b,c). The space-filling model indicates that the pores in this framework are mainly occupied by coordinated solvent molecules, and there exist 1D tiny pores along the a axis that are filled with free DMF molecules (Figure 2d).   Figure 2 Structure of 2 showing (a) the coordination geometry of the binuclear Er2(BDC-F4)3(DMF)(H2O) fragment, (b) a 1D infinite secondary building unit with ball-and-stick representation (left) and with Er atoms shown as polyhedra (right), (c) a 3D MOF viewed along the 1D Er2(CO2)6 rod (DMF and H2O molecules are omitted for clarity), and (d) a space-filling representation viewed along the a axis (uncoordinated DMF molecules are omitted for clarity; Er, light green; F, light cyan; N, blue; O, red; C, gray).    Although 1 and 2 have quite different crystal structures, the emissive Er ions/unit volume of 1.24 Er3+/1000 \u00c53 in 1 is only slightly higher than that of 1.14 Er3+/1000 \u00c53 in 2. Their structural diversity is partly attributed to the different spatial arrangement of the organic linkers BDC and BDC-F4 in 1 and 2, respectively. The carboxylate group in 1 is almost coplanar with the phenyl plane of the BDC linker, while the carboxylate group in 2 significantly deviates from  the phenyl plane of the BDC-F4 linker because of the stronger repulsion between F and carboxylate.  TGA\u2212DSC Study. TGA\u2212DSC studies indicated that compound 1 starts losing solvent molecules at a temperature of 135 \u00b0C and the desolvated compound 1a is stable up to about 480 \u00b0C (calcd solvent loss (2DMF + 3H2O), 19.48%; exptl, 19.15%; Figure 3a). Compound 2 gradually loses H2O (calcd, 1.49%; exptl, 1.77%), free DMF (calcd, 6.05%; exptl, 6.18%), and coordinated DMF (calcd, 6.05%; exptl, 6.58%) at elevated temperatures (Figure 3b).   Figure 3 TGA\u2212DSC diagrams of (a) 1 and (b) 2.    UV\u2212Vis\u2212Near-IR Spectroscopy and Luminescence Properties. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit well-resolved UV\u2212vis\u2212near-IR absorption spectra (Figure 4). The strong absorption below 350 nm is ascribed to the organic linker's \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 transitions, while 10 absorption bands above 350 nm can be readily assigned to the corresponding electronic transitions of the Er3+ ion from the ground state 4I15/2 to the excited states 4I13/2, 4I11/2, 4I9/2, 4F9/2, 4S3/2, 2H11/2, 4F7/2, 4F5/2, 2H9/2, 4G11/2, and 2G9/2.   Figure 4 UV\u2212vis\u2212near-IR absorption spectra of (a) 1 and (b) 2, respectively.    The fluorescence properties of the compounds were studied under excitation of an 808-nm band using LD as the light source. No fluorescence was detected from the as-synthesized compounds 1 and 2 at room temperature. This is mainly because of the quenching effect of high-energy C\u2212H and/or O\u2212H oscillators from free and coordinated H2O and DMF solvent molecules. To minimize the solvents' quenching effect, the as-synthesized compounds were activated under vacuum at 140 \u00b0C overnight to form the desolvated solid 1a and the partially desolvated solid 2a for near-IR\u2212luminescence studies, which were also carried out under the excitation of an 808-nm band using LD as the light source (Figure 5). Before their luminescence properties were examined, compounds 1a and 2a were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, and PXRD. 1a is a poor crystalline solid whose PXRD is significantly broadened and different from that of 1. IR spectra of 1a show that DMF CO stretches at 1651 cm-1 completely disappear and carboxylate CO stretches and phenyl vibrations match well with those of 1. 1a is stable in air, presumably a condensed solid by further coordination of some carboxylate O atoms to Er ions. 2a has the same  structure as 2, as shown in its PXRD, which is slightly different from that of 2, and IR spectra, which are almost identical with that of 2. It is of special interest to note that the fluorescent emission intensity of 2a at about 1.55 \u03bcm, which is attributed to the 4I13/2 \u2192 4I15/2 transition of a Er3+ ion, is significantly enhanced and is about 3 times higher than that of 1a. Because 2a still contains a certain amount of DMF solvent molecules, which can reduce the luminescence intensity, we speculate that the fluorination can greatly improve the quantum yield of the 4I13/2 \u2192 4I15/2 transition in erbium\u2212organic framework materials.   Figure 5 Near-IR\u2212fluorescence spectra of (a) 1a and (b) 2a excited at 808 nm by a LD.   The mechanisms for such an improvement in fluorescent erbium\u2212organic framework materials are clearly illustrated in Figure 6, in which the energy level diagrams of the Er3+ ion, C\u2212H (2950 cm-1) and C\u2212F (1220 cm-1) vibrations, are presented. It can be seen that the second-order C\u2212H bond vibrational frequencies (5900 cm-1) are almost in resonance with the emission bands of the Er3+ ion at 1.5 \u03bcm (4I13/2 \u2192 4I15/2), while only the fifth-order C\u2212F bond vibrational frequencies (6100 cm-1) can approach in resonance with such an emission transition; thus, the effect of the C\u2212F vibration on the fluorescence quenching of the Er3+ ion emission is much lower than that of the C\u2212H vibration. By making use of fluorinated organic linker BDC-F4 instead of BDC, such a fluorescence quenching effect is much reduced and minimized, leading to a higher luminescence intensity of compound 2a than of 1a.   Figure 6 Schematic representation of the vibrational quenching of the 4I13/2 emission of Er3+ by the vibrational modes of CH, OH, and CF functional groups.    It is assumed that the luminescence intensity of Er\u2212BDC-F4 frameworks can be further enhanced by eliminating the solvents' quenching effect. Because it is quite difficult to further activate compound 2a at elevated temperature to form a new stable solid because of its low thermal stability, we plan to incorporate ancillary electron-rich organic ligands instead of solvent molecules to saturate the Er3+ coordination sites. Such efforts have been ongoing to target more promising near-IR emissive Er\u2212BDC-F4 framework solids for their potential applications in sensing and optics.
