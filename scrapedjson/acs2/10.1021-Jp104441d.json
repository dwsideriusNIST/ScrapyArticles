This is partly due to the wide variety of different inorganic connectors, the so-called secondary building units (SBUs).(4) However, a large number of new network topologies and structural variations result from new or modified organic linkers combined with well-known SBUs. In this context, one type of SBU, namely, the Cu2(O2C)4 paddle-wheel metal dimer, forming a four-coordinate square-planar vertex is extensively used. These systems can be synthesized relatively easily, and the remaining axial coordination site, usually referred to as an open metal site,(5) can be advantageous for gas storage or in catalysis. One of the earliest and most investigated MOFs is the copper paddle-wheel-based Cu3(btc)2 (btc is 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), abbreviated in the following text as Cu-btc (Figure 1).(6) Many other copper paddle-wheel-based systems have been synthesized, as, for example, systems with a high hydrogen storage capacity.(7) Another structurally interesting example is the chiral networks that could be realized by using a homochiral linker together with the copper paddle-wheel SBU.(8) The possibility to tune the structure and dimensionality of such frameworks by systematic modifications of the linker was exemplified on this inorganic node.(9) Note that an additional class of porous coordination polymers can be formed by using ditopic nitrogen donor ligands as pillars connecting 2D sheets of paddle-wheel SBUs linked by dicarboxylic acids.(10, 11) Here, however, the open metal site is blocked.  Figure 1. Copper paddle-wheel-based Cu2(btc)3. For a deeper understanding and a rational design of these porous materials, theoretical modeling has been of pivotal importance from the beginning.(12-14) In particular, atomistic simulations allow a better understanding of the host\u2212guest interactions, which are most relevant to technical applications. The methodology of Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble (GCMC) has been developed in the field of zeolite research,(15, 16) and the simulation protocols could be transferred to MOF systems.(13) By analogy to the rather rigid zeolite frameworks, the network geometry of MOFs was assumed to be rigid and was taken from experimental data in the majority of investigations. However, one of the key points of MOFs is the conformational flexibility of both organic linkers and inorganic SBUs. In the case of guest molecule adsorption, this leads to very interesting dynamic behavior such as the so-called \u201cbreathing\u201d effect, where the pore volume changes significantly,(17) or the \u201cgate opening\u201d effect with strong hysteresis in the adsorption isotherms.(18) It is clear that rigid framework models are of no use in these cases. Unfortunately, quantum mechanical methods are numerically too demanding,(19) and classical molecular mechanics force field (FF) methods lack the parameters needed for the inorganic SBUs.(14) Sometimes, generic force fields with an atom-based parametrization, such as the UFF method,(20) are employed. However, the accuracy of these methods for different systems is not clear or validated and, more importantly, cannot be systematically improved. Thus, more recently, fully flexible FFs for selected MOFs have been developed. Most of them are parametrized for the Zn4O(O2C)6 SBU in MOF-5 and the IRMOF family and were employed for the investigation of framework-dynamic-related properties such as (negative) thermal expansion, elastic constants, vibrational spectra, and thermal conductivity.(21-26) Another system for which flexible FFs have been developed are the breathing MIL-53 systems.(27) Here, the shrinking and expansion of the unit cell with increasing guest molecule loading could be reproduced. We have recently developed an automated strategy utilizing a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method to derive accurate FF parameters in a consistent way from first-principles-calculated reference data.(26) With this, we could parametrize an accurate FF for the Zn4O(O2C)6 SBU, which is able to reproduce the elastic constants of MOF-5 determined by periodic DFT methods.(28) By employing the same parametrization strategy, we developed a first-principles-derived FF for the boron-containing 3D-periodic covalent organic framework COF-102.(29) To our knowledge, such a fully flexible FF was used here for the first time to compute relative strain energies of both known and unknown network topologies, explaining the observed structure.(30) This FF has meanwhile been used to investigate yet unknown COFs for their potential in hydrogen storage.(31) For the above-mentioned copper paddle-wheel SBU, there is to our knowledge no accurately parametrized flexible force field available, presumably because of the difficulty in describing the coordination environment in this deformed square-planar Cu(II) system. Until now, theoretical investigations have concentrated on the Cu-btc system, with a particular focus on guest molecule adsorption and transport within the pores.(32-41) To the best of our knowledge, all of these molecular simulations were performed by keeping the framework rigid. As a continuation of our previous work on the Zn4O(O2C)6 SBU, we present here a first-principles-derived flexible force field for the dicopper(II) tetracarboxylate core. Using the building block approach introduced previously for the case of MOF-5,(26) this FF can be used in connection with parameter sets for di-, tri-, or tetracarboxylic linkers to simulate any copper paddle-wheel-based MOF. Note that the new force field currently excludes axial coordination to the open metal site. In a number of adsorption studies, the coordinative bonding to the copper atom was described by a combination of (partly readjusted) electrostatic charge\u2212charge and van der Waals interactions.(38) However, this coordination is clearly due to an orbital interaction with a strong directionality, which cannot be captured by two-body potentials. Preliminary tests of such a nonbonded FF(14) for water ligation resulted in pronounced structural artifacts as a result of the lack of directionality of the Cu\u2212Owater bond. Thus, the FF is intentionally restricted to the case of ligand-free \u201cactivated\u201d MOFs. We are currently working on an extension of our FF to include ligand coordination in the future. The final FF is used to investigate properties such as elastic constants and the thermal expansion of the experimentally well characterized Cu-btc, which depend on the flexibility and dynamics of the framework. The results demonstrate the potential of such strictly bottom-up-derived FFs to predict even deformed network structures, lifting the constriction on experimentally observed frameworks. Top of PageAbstractIntroductionComputational DetailsResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesComputational Details The model systems used for the FF parametrization were fully optimized by density functional theory (DFT) using the hybrid functional B3LYP(42-44) with the Gaussian 03 program package.(45) The augmented correlation-consistent basis sets aug-cc-pVDZ(46) were employed for all atoms, if not stated otherwise. Note that we found the augmented basis sets to be necessary to describe the conjugation of anionic carboxylates.(47) For consistency, we used them throughout. For the Cu atoms, energy-consistent pseudopotentials denoted as (aug-)cc-pVDZ-PP,(48-50) obtained from the EMSL Basis Set Exchange site,(51, 52) were employed. Because of the presence of low vibrational modes (on the order of 10 cm\u22121), we used a tight convergence criterion (opt = tight) and a finer grid for the integration (int = ultrafine). The optimized structures were confirmed to be true minima by vibrational frequency calculations. For all force field calculations, an adapted version of the Tinker suite of molecular mechanics programs was employed.(53) Details of our GA implementation for force field generation can be found in ref 26. For the periodic Cu-btc, a full crystal energy minimization was performed without any symmetry constraint (space group P1). A cutoff value of 12 \u00c5 for the van der Waals interactions (switched to zero at the cutoff radius) was used, and the electrostatic interactions were computed by a smooth particle mesh Ewald summation with a real space cutoff value of 12 \u00c5. Molecular dynamics simulations in the NPT ensemble were performed with an integration time step of 1.0 fs, a 0.1 ps thermostat relaxation time, and a 2.0 ps barostat relaxation time using the Berendsen bath coupling method(54) as implemented in Tinker. The infrared spectrum of the periodic Cu-btc was calculated by a Fourier transform of the dipole moment time derivative autocorrelation function, derived from an MD simulation at room temperature in the NVE ensemble, following previous work.(25) Top of PageAbstractIntroductionComputational DetailsResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesResults and Discussion  Reference Systems On the basis of our previous experience, where the necessary FF parameters for MOF-5 could be successfully derived using the basic zinc formate as a model system,(26) we used the most simple model system for a dicopper paddle-wheel unit, namely, the dicopper tetraformate shown in Figure 2. Dinuclear paddle-wheel carboxylates are ubiquitous in metal\u2212organic chemistry.(55) A number of second-row transition-metal-containing compounds have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically, with a special emphasis on the metal\u2212metal interactions. For example, a DFT investigation of molecular structures and vibrational spectra of dinuclear tetracarboxylates (formate and acetate) of molybdenum and rhodium confirms the reliability of the DFT method.(56) Much less attention has been devoted to the theoretical investigation of the first-row transition-metal carboxylates (excluding chromium) such as copper and zinc compounds, with the general belief that no metal\u2212metal bond is formed in their dinuclear carboxylates.  Figure 2. Model system used for the force field parametrization. Important bond lengths and angles are given in angstroms and degrees. Computed atomic charges for each atom type are shown in parentheses. Dimeric copper(II) carboxylates have been known for a long time, since the discovery of unusual magnetic properties of copper acetate monohydrate, Cu2(O2CCH3)4(H2O)2, whose antiferromagnetic character was explained by its dimeric structure,(57) which was predicted(58) before it could be confirmed.(59) Magnetic coupling between metal centers in this particular compound was quite early a subject of theoretical study.(60) Its triplet excited state is very close to the open-shell singlet ground state, and the energy splitting is a very sensitive probe for judging the performance of different levels of theory.(61-64) The geometry of Cu2(O2CH)4 was optimized using the spin-unrestricted hybrid DFT method (UB3LYP) and applying the so-called broken-spatial-symmetry (BS) approach.(65, 66) Because of the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling, the high-spin (triplet) excited state of the dimeric copper(II) acetate is experimentally found to be only 292.2 cm\u22121 above the open-shell singlet ground state (Ci symmetry),(67) whereas our calculations (UB3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ-PP) gave a value of 372 cm\u22121 for the Cu2(O2CCH3)4(H2O)2 acetate, taken as 2 times the (geometry-optimized) energy difference between the high-spin and the BS states, 2(EHS \u2212 EBS). (See also ref 61.) Despite the accuracy of this energy separation, the open-shell singlet ground state shows sizable spin contamination (S2 = 0.98 for the formate model), which might affect its use as a reference.(68) Because both the geometries and the vibrational frequencies of these two states are nearly indistinguishable for the purpose of our force field parametrization, we used the triplet state as the reference because it is also more straightforward to calculate. In addition, the triplet state is appreciably populated at room temperature. Note, however, that the closed-shell singlet state was calculated to lie energetically far above the triplet state (12860 cm\u22121) and should not be used as a reference. In Figure 2, the optimized structure with relevant geometrical data is shown. To assess the quality of our DFT reference structure, in Table 1 a comparison with experimental data was performed. To facilitate this, the computed results for the water-coordinated formate and acetate are also given. An important point when comparing experimental data and theoretical results determined in vacuum is the hydrogen bond interactions between the axial water ligand and the carboxylate oxygens. For the theoretically optimized structures with axial water, the Cu\u2212Cu\u2212Owater angle is significantly bent in order to allow for an intramolecular interaction with the carboxylate oxygens, which is not observed in the neutron diffraction study of the dicopper acetate.(69) It is purely an artifact of the isolated molecule calculation, where the presence of other surrounding molecules is ignored and leads to a reduction in symmetry and two different Cu\u2212Ocarb bond lengths. However, the different intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in the experimental structures also result in a scattering of the observed Cu\u2212Ocarb bond distances, making it hard to compare properly. We note here that in the as-synthesized Cu-btc material(6) no bending of the Cu\u2212Cu\u2212Owater is seen and all Cu\u2212Ocarb distances are of the same length (within experimental error). Obviously, an extensive hydrogen-bonded network with some additional water molecules is formed. As observed previously,(26) the metal\u2212oxygen bond lengths are somewhat overestimated on the DFT level as compared to the corresponding MP2 results (UMP2/aug-cc-pVDZ-PP). The most noticeable change on axial coordination with water is the fact that both the Cu\u2212Cu distance and the Cu\u2212Ocarb distances are elongated by ca. 0.08 \u00c5 and 0.01\u22120.03 \u00c5, respectively. This effect has recently been observed for the Cu-btc network.(70) Our calculations on the paddle-wheel unit without axial water give the Cu\u2212Cu distance in good agreement with that found in the fully desolvated Cu-btc framework (2.50 \u00c5(70, 71)). Note that the Cu\u2212Ocarb bonds in solid copper acetate monohydrate, which are not perturbed by hydrogen bonds, are similar in length (1.942(1) and 1.952(1) \u00c5(69)) to those found in the Cu-btc framework (1.952(3) \u00c5(6)).

From this comparison, we can conclude that effects such as the systematic error of the given level of theory, the simplified formate model system, or additional hydrogen bonding on the structural parameters are small. Thus, the formate model computed on the DFT level can serve well as a reference for our force field parametrization, as we seek for the minimum structure and curvature of an \u201cunbiased\u201d potential energy surface. As in our previous work,(26) we intentionally do not correct for deficiencies of the DFT method but fit to reproduce this higher-level method in the sense of a multiscale simulation approach. Accordingly, the calculated Hessian matrix elements were taken unscaled for the parameter fit. Following the protocol developed previously,(26) the effective atomic charges were obtained from the fitting of the electrostatic potential (ESP) based on the Merz\u2212Kollman sampling scheme(72) using ca. 2000 grid points per atom. (For a critical comparison of methods for charge derivation, see ref 14.) The van der Waals exclusion radius of 2.26 \u00c5 for the Cu atom was taken from ref 73. The resulting atomic charges are given in parentheses in Figure 2. Our calculated charges are in good agreement with those obtained in previous studies with slightly different basis sets and fitting protocols.(35, 41) To describe the Cu-btc system, additional parameters, which are missing in the standard MM3 parameter set, were derived from a sodium benzoate model, which was optimized on the same B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory, following our previous study on carboxylate force fields.(47)  Parametrization The parametrization strategy focuses on accuracy in reproducing the reference data at the expense of transferability. The primary step is the choice of the nonbonded parameters. van der Waals (vdW) interactions are described by the MM3 specific Buckingham potential(74) and the usual Lorentz\u2212Berthelot mixing rules, with all parameters taken unadjusted from ref 73. (For a listing, see Table 2.) These generic vdW parameters are available for the full periodic table and are the only values derived or extrapolated from experimental data. Note that the primary intention of our force field is to reproduce the conformational flexibility of the network itself, and it is not specifically adjusted for the weaker intermolecular host\u2212guest interactions. However, with this approach we could successfully reproduce the diffusivity of benzene MOF-5 in previous work.(75) In the future, the parameter set might have to be fine-tuned selectively for intermolecular interactions, but doing this in a purely first-principles-based bottom-up strategy is computationally demanding and has until now been performed only for small gas molecules such as hydrogen or methane.(14) All other parameters have been derived from the corresponding first-principles calculations. In contrast to the MM3 energy expression, where bond dipoles are used to describe electrostatic interactions, atomic point charges are used in our force field (with interactions between 1,4-connected atoms scaled by a factor of 0.5). To arrive at a charge-neutral Cu2(O2C)4 fragment, the small charge on the formate hydrogen was added to Cu and Ocarb, leading to the following charges used in the force field calculations: Cu, +1.2; Ocarb, \u22120.64; and Ccarb, +0.68. For the remaining atoms of the organic linkers, we use the following atomic charges: Cph, \u22120.12 and H, +0.12 for all Cph\u2212H groups and a zero charge for all other Cph species. A general issue in modeling coordination compounds is the large partial charges needed to represent the electrostatic potential in the surrounding region. In particular, in the copper dimer the charge of +1.2 on the two metal atoms in close proximity of only about 2.5 \u00c5 leads to a strong electrostatic repulsion, which is an artifact of the atomic point charge model.(76) This leads to carboxylate bending potentials that are too stiff to compensate for this repulsion and maintain the structure. To avoid this problem, we introduced an explicit Cu\u2212Cu bond to exclude this 1,2-interaction. Note that this is only for modeling the system properly and has nothing to do with the true presence of a chemical bond between the metal atoms.    Table 2.

The functional form of the energy expression for the bonded interactions is a modified form of the MM3(2000) force field of Allinger.(74) We have modified the original MM3 stretch\u2212bend cross term by introducing two different force constants for the two bonds that comprise a bond angle and implemented a new stretch\u2212stretch cross term.(26) The weaker Cu\u2212Ocarb coordination bonds are described by a Morse potential  (where kstretch is the force constant, r0 is the reference distance, and \u03b1 = 2.5 \u00c5\u22121), which was found to be superior to the standard MM3 quartic term used for all other bonds.(14) For the square-coordination environment of Cu(II) with angular minima at 90 and 180\u00b0, an improved Fourier-type angle-bending potential is used(77) (discussed in more detail in ref 78)  where \u03b8 is the Ocarb\u2212Cu\u2212Ocarb angle and only kbend needs to be adjusted. To fit the necessary additional parameters, the DFT-optimized geometries of the reference systems and the Cartesian Hessian matrices were projected into a redundant set of internal coordinates defined by the force field connectivity. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the FF parameters to reproduce the reference data. For the objective function, both geometry and Hessian data (diagonal and selected off-diagonal elements) for the parametrized internal coordinates were included in a weighted root-mean-square deviation scheme. In the case of the dicopper formate model, we performed 20 independent GA runs (population size 200; 100 generations) and a final \u201cshoot-out\u201d run using the best individuals from the previous runs. This protocol reliably results in a very high final fitness. For further details on the fitting strategy, see ref 26. The linker model system was used to parametrize the Ccarb\u2212Cph interaction including stretching, bending, out-of-plane bending, torsion, and cross terms. For torsional barriers, in addition to the curvature at the energy minimum, rotational energy barriers were also included in the fitting procedure. Following the MM3 scheme for aromatic systems, the parameters for the Cph\u2212Cph bond stretch force constant and the 2-fold torsion potential were adjusted by performing a self-consistent-field molecular orbital calculation for the \u03c0 system using a modified Pariser\u2212Parr\u2212Pople method.(79) However, this was not done \u201con the fly\u201d; the parameters were kept fixed. In Table 2, all parameters are given.  Validation At first, we directly compare the results of the dicopper formate model (Figure 2) with the DFT reference. As expected, the structure is reproduced very well as shown in Table 1. The low vibrational frequencies below 300 cm\u22121 are compared in Table 3. The largest relative deviations are observed for the two lowest modes, which can be described as a twist around the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu axis and a D4h to D2d symmetry distortion from a square-planar to a tetrahedral copper coordination environment, respectively. These discrepancies in the normal modes persist, despite the low deviations between elements of the redundant internal coordinate Hessian, included in the fitting, from the force field and the DFT reference, respectively. However, a close inspection of the off-diagonal terms of the reference Hessian shows, for example, strong coupling between the Cu\u2212Cu and the Ocarb\u2212Ccarb stretch with a force constant above 1 mdyn/\u00c5. This reveals the peculiar electronic interactions in a coordination complex, which cannot fully be captured by a force field without a stretch\u2212stretch cross term for nonadjacent bonds. In addition, we presume that the large electrostatic interactions between highly charged atomic sites in close proximity might also lead to a potential that is too stiff.(76) However, the overall agreement is gratifying in view of the fact that only a limited number of cross terms are included. In particular, the frequency of the normal mode best described as the Cu\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cu stretch (222/219 cm\u22121) and the soft in-plane deformations of the square SBU (154/161 cm\u22121 and 164/164 cm\u22121, bending of Ocarb\u2212Cu\u2212Ocarb), which are most relevant to the flexibility of the MOFs, are very well reproduced by the force field.

Vibrational Modes (in cm\u22121) below 300 cm\u22121 for the Dicopper Tetraformate Model System UB3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ-PPforce fielddeviationmode degeneracy5891\u221233167124\u2212581106118\u2212132154161\u22128216416401222219+41225179+451232229+32251229+221274290\u2212161  In the next step, the FF was used to investigate the experimentally well characterized periodic Cu-btc, which represents a 3,4-connected network in the tbo topology.(80) The optimized lattice size of 26.3833 \u00c5 (corresponding to the zero Kelvin limit) is in good agreement with the value of 26.3046(2)(81) for a fully desolvated Cu-btc measured at low temperature (T = 77 K). Our results suggest that the lattice constant is particularly sensitive to the Cu\u2212O length, and the discrepancy can be explained by the overestimation of this distance by the DFT method (1.97 \u00c5) as compared to the experimental value (1.92 \u00c5).(81) A similar observation has been made before in our study on MOF-5.(26) We intentionally accept this slight deviation, which is due to the first-principles reference, and refrain from a manual \u201ctuning\u201d of the parameters after the automated GA fitting procedure. In the tbo network, the trigonal vertex has a 3-fold symmetry axis, whereas the four-coordinate vertex has reduced local D2d symmetry with two different angles of 109.5 and 70.5\u00b0. As a consequence, a deformation is needed to accommodate the square-planar copper paddle-wheel SBU, leading to the typical bowing of the linker as shown on the right in Figure 3. In contrast to the 19.5\u00b0 deviation in the parent network, Ccarb\u2212XCu2\u2212Ccarb (where XCu2 is the centroid of the two Cu atoms) deviates only by 2.4\u00b0 from orthogonality. The remaining deformation is transferred to an out-of-plane bending of the carboxylate \u201chinge\u201d and a bending of the carboxylate out of the phenyl ring plane. However, relaxing a cut-out paddle-wheel unit with the adjacent phenyl rings (shown on the left in Figure 3) reveals that a strain energy of only 1.1 kcal/mol is stored in this fragment, which is well accessible by thermal fluctuations. A comparison of the Ccarb\u2212XCu2\u2212Ccarb and the XCu2\u2212Ccarb\u2212Cph angles with the corresponding experimental data (in parentheses in Figure 3) in ref 81 demonstrates the accuracy of the FF.  Figure 3. Copper paddle-wheel fragment with adjacent phenyl rings cut out of Cu-btc shown on the right, demonstrating the deformation necessary to adopt to the tbo network topology. Ccarb\u2212XCu2\u2212Ccarb and XCu2\u2212Ccarb\u2212Cph angles are given in degrees; experimental data in parentheses are from ref 81. For completeness, we also computed the IR spectrum of Cu-btc using the dipole moment time derivative autocorrelation function in order to estimate the IR intensities of the power spectrum. In Figure 4, the result is compared with an experimental measurement for an activated Cu-btc sample, showing similar peaks as reported in the literature.(82) Overall, even the smaller features of the spectrum above 400 cm\u22121 are well reproduced. In particular, the strongest peaks related to the Ocarb\u2212Ccarb\u2212Ocarb bending (760 cm\u22121) and the Ccarb\u2212Ocarb stretching (asym, 1645 cm\u22121; sym, 1440 cm\u22121) are well reproduced. Note that a comparison of these higher normal modes, computed on the DFT and FF levels for the formate reference system, reveal the necessity of further cross terms also for nonadjacent bonds, in order to capture the coupling of the symmetric and asymmetric Ccarb\u2212Ocarb stretching modes accurately.(47) We speculate that this, and the Cph\u2212Cph parameter taken unfitted from MM3, are the cause for the smaller and slightly shifted peaks in the region above 1200 cm\u22121 in the computed spectrum. However, these medium- and high-frequency normal modes are rather stiff and contribute only marginally to lattice deformation and dynamics compared to the low modes below 400 cm\u22121.  Figure 4. Comparison of the computed IR spectrum (bottom) with the measured (top) spectrum for a desolvated, activated Cu-btc sample.(83) To test the validity of our flexible force field for dynamic properties, we computed the thermal expansion coefficient of desolvated Cu-btc. In Figure 5, the temperature dependence of the lattice constant is shown and was obtained from a series of NPT ensemble simulations between 200 and 500 K at a pressure of 1 atm. At each temperature, the system was subjected to 100 ps of temperature equilibration at constant volume (NVT), followed by a 100 ps equilibration in the NPT ensemble and a 400 ps sampling run (NPT). Despite the above-discussed offset in the lattice parameter, our simulations give a volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of \u22121.07 \u00d7 10\u22125 K\u22121 and quantitatively reproduce(84) the negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior of the desolvated Cu-btc material as measured recently in the experimental studies(71, 81) (Figure 5), which is, however, significantly smaller than that found for MOF-5.(22) This result is a clear indication of the accuracy of the first-principles-derived FF, which is able to reproduce such a complex global framework motion without the use of experimental data in the parametrization.  Figure 5. Temperature-dependent variation of the simulated lattice constant of Cu-btc with standard deviations (\u25fb). The value at T = 0 K results from the full optimization of Cu-btc. Experimental data are from synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measurements (\u25b2).(71) In addition, we computed the elastic constants of the material, which can be important for its technical application. The bulk modulus, B, is calculated to be 25 GPa (computational details in ref 26), in excellent agreement with the experimental value of about 30 GPa for the nondesolvated Cu-btc.(85) In accordance with the lower NTE, the predicted bulk modulus of Cu-btc is appreciably larger than that found in MOF-5 (14 GPa),(26) indicating its higher stiffness. Note that in contrast to the discrepancy between experimental results determined by nanoindentation and theoretical results in the case of MOF-5,(28) here good agreement between the measured and computed bulk moduli is found. The shear modulus (C11 \u2212 C12) of Cu-btc is computed to be 3.5 GPa, and the strain modulus C44 is 13 GPa.  Top of PageAbstractIntroductionComputational DetailsResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesConclusions The MM3-based force field presented here is, to our knowledge, the first ab-initio-derived fully flexible force field for copper paddle-wheel-based MOFs. The energy expression is extended with specific cross terms and bond-stretching and angle-bending terms, which are suited to the modeling of the pseudosquare copper coordination environment. Following our previous work on Zn4O-based MOFs,(26) we used a genetic algorithm parameter fitting method. Structure and Hessian matrix reference data of nonperiodic models were calculated on the DFT level (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level), which was verified to be sufficiently accurate in comparison to experimental data and higher-level theory. For validation, the resulting force field was employed to compute the structure, IR spectrum, elastic constants, and thermal expansion of the well-known Cu-btc (HKUST-1).(6) An indication of the accuracy of the force field is the fact that the measured NTE(71, 81) is quantitatively reproduced. The origin of this effect is the delicate global motion of the framework and shows that in particular the low normal modes responsible for the network deformation are well parametrized. In addition, the measured bulk modulus of Cu-btc(85) is well reproduced by the force field. In conclusion, we could show that an accurate force field can be used to compute network structures and complex lattice dynamics of copper paddle-wheel-based metal\u2212organic frameworks. In combination with parametrizations for other organic linkers, it can be employed for arbitrary systems beyond the ones investigated here, such as those where recently a symmetry-preserving isomerism has been observed.(86) We are currently using the new force field to explore possible topologies of 3,4-connected networks such as Cu-btc. With its predictive potential, it is useful both in the structural characterization of already-known MOFs and in computing yet unknown structures (e.g., those for a theoretical prescreening of host\u2212guest interactions).
