Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), such as MIL-125 (Ti), exhibit enhanced surface areas due to their high intrinsic microporosity, but the pore diameters of most microporous MOFs are often too small to allow for the diffusion of larger reactants (>7 \u00c5) relevant to petroleum and biomass upgrading.

Upon addition of Ti(O-", "i", "Pr)", "4", ", this solution undergoes a sudden and dramatic increase in solution viscosity, which indicates strong chemical interactions are taking place (Scheme S1, ", "Supporting Information", "). Multiple interactions (individual or combinations thereof) could be occurring, and a much more in-depth study is needed to unambiguously determine the identity of these. But we can surmise that these interactions would first result from the formation of metal\u2013organic oligomers of titanium methoxide and titanium isopropoxide.", "(38)", " Additionally, there could be exchange of alkoxide ligands with the carboxylate ligands of BDC forming MOF precursors.", "(39)", " Finally, the surfactant molecules could cap the MOF precursors. This interaction has been seen in both zeolite and MOF syntheses in which surfactants have been used to cap crystals and modulate crystal growth.", "(27-34)", " Furthermore, DBT oxidation was attempted with a meso-MIL-125 catalyst prior to surfactant removal. No catalysis occurred indicating that the external active sites were blocked by the CTAB capping the MOF particles. Afterward, the solvent (MeOH) is removed under vacuum, embedding the prepolymerized metal\u2013organic oligomers in place in an organic/inorganic matrix composed of the surfactant. This process has been suggested by both Naik et al.", "(27, 28)", " and Sakthivel et al.", "(29)", " during synthesis of zeolites by surfactant modulated dry gel conversion methods. This embedding process is crucial to the synthesis because it immobilizes the MOF precursors in a confined environment during VAC, preventing the formation of large crystals and allowing for the production of mesoporous aggregates of small particles. This was corroborated by an additional synthetic experiment in which MOF precursors were directly mixed and subjected to VAC without an embedding stage (e.g., methanol mixing and removal). The resulting MOF displayed inferior pore properties and no interparticle mesoporosity. When the precursor-embedded matrix is correctly formed and subjected to VAC, the solvent (DMF/MeOH) is vaporized and condensed on the solid precursor powder allowing for solvent/precursor interaction. Due to the high concentration of well-mixed reactants, the MOF precursors undergo fast crystallization as seen in zeolite synthesis by similar methods.", "(40, 41)", " This physical phenomenon is also crucial to the synthesis of the mesoporous MOF because dissolution of the embedded matrix in a solvent during a solvothermal process resulted in a microporous MOF but failed to yield interparticle mesoporosity, which indicated the need to retain the confined environment present in a VAC synthesis. As an additional check, we also synthesized MIL-125 solvothermally with the addition of CTAB and citric acid as a cooperative template following reported methods. Again, the resulting MOF was not mesoporous, which further highlighted the need for the VAC method when synthesizing mesoporous MIL-125.", "Scheme 1. Schematic Representation of Mesoporous MIL-125 Formation", "To demonstrate the benefits of mesoporosity, we tested the optimum meso-MIL-125 material along with both solv-micro-MIL-125 and VAC-micro-MIL-125 for catalytic activity in the oxidation of DBT by ", "tert", "-butyl hydroperoxide and the results are shown in Figure ", "6", " and summarized in Table ", "1", ". It should be noted here that DBT is initially oxidized to its corresponding sulfoxide and subsequently oxidized to the corresponding sulfone through a series reaction. In this work, only the sulfone was detected via both GC-FID and GC-MS. Apparent reaction rate constants were determined by fitting experimental data to a pseudo-first-order model. As noted previously and shown in Figure ", "6", ", DBT is a heterocyclic, aromatic, sulfur containing compound that is too bulky to fit into the micropores of MIL-125.", "(9)", " Thus, the addition of interparticle mesoporosity in the MIL-125 structure large enough to accommodate DBT should have a significant effect on catalysis by allowing access to more active sites. The solv-micro-MIL-125 sample exhibited a similar rate constant (", "k", "app", " = 11.8 \u00d7 10", "\u20133", " min", "\u20131", ") to its microporous VAC analogue (", "k", "app", " = 11.6 \u00d7 10", "\u20133", " min", "\u20131", "), which was attributed to the similar surface areas of the two samples. The meso-MIL-125 sample, however, displayed significantly increased activity (", "k", "app", " = 22.9 \u00d7 10", "\u20133", " min", "\u20131", ") despite having a lower total surface area than both microporous samples. Furthermore, the meso-MIL-125 material retained its high activity and crystalline MOF structure upon subsequent recycle reactions (Figures S11 and S12, ", "Supporting Information", "). These recycle results indicated the VAC method of synthesis with CTAB provided a reproducible catalytic activity enhancement compared to the microporous MOF.", "Figure 6. Fitting of experimental data to a pseudo-first-order rate model in the oxidation of DBT for (blue \u25cf) solv-micro-MIL-125, (red \u25b2) VAC-micro-MIL-125, and (black \u25a0) meso-MIL-125.

If the surface of each material (microporous or mesoporous) is truly comprised of the same type of unsaturated Ti species as catalytically active sites, the initial reaction rates normalized on accessible catalytic surface area, which includes external and interparticle mesoporous surface areas, should be equal for all materials. As expected, the normalized initial reaction rates for all materials were nearly identical (Table ", "1", ", \u223c22.0 \u00d7 10", "\u22127", " mol", "DBT", " min", "\u20131", " m", "2", "accessible", ") indicating the VAC method for introducing mesoporosity did not alter the nature of the catalytic sites but instead provided enhanced accessibility to active sites.", "To further investigate this claim, we performed adsorption studies and used this data to calculate heats of adsorption for all materials. The heat of adsorption is an indicator of the strength of interaction between an adsorbate and an adsorbent and could be used to glean insight about the energetics of a catalytic mechanism. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that organosulfur compounds can adsorb to coordinatively unsaturated metal sites in MOFs.", "(44, 45)", " Thiophene is an organosulfur compound that is similar in structure to DBT except it does not contain the two fused phenyl side rings. Rather, it is a five-membered heterocyclic aromatic sulfur compound with a kinetic diameter of 4.6 \u00c5, which allows it to fit into the micropores of MIL-125.", "(46)", " The heats of adsorption of thiophene on the MIL-125 samples were determined via a TGA/DSC experiment (see the ", "Experimental Section", " for details). In this experiment, N", "2", " was bubbled through thiophene (bp = 84 \u00b0C) and over the samples which were kept isothermal at 90 \u00b0C, while heat flow and weight were monitored as a function of adsorption time. The heats of adsorption of thiophene on the MIL-125 samples as a function of coverage is shown in Figure ", "7", ". All three samples showed similar heats of adsorption (average \u0394", "H", "ads", " = \u221248.5 \u00b1 1.4 kJ mol", "\u20131", ") for coverages between 0.1 and 0.8. While these results cannot be used to identify the different types of active sites present, they can, however, be used to suggest that the active sites in the MIL-125 samples were all energetically equivalent.", "(47)", " This adsorption study further corroborates the claim that the meso-MIL-125 does not contain a new type of active site, but rather the addition of interparticle mesoporosity was responsible for the increase in activity seen in the DBT oxidation reaction due to enhanced accessibility. Of additional note, the meso-MIL-125 sample also had a larger capacity for thiophene adsorption (0.65 mol", "thiophene", " mol", "Ti", "\u20131", ") than the microporous solvothermal and VAC samples (0.53 and 0.55 mol", "thiophene", " mol", "Ti", "\u20131", ", respectively). Because the microporous samples have higher total surface areas than the mesoporous sample, these results suggest that the mesoporous sample actually contained a higher density of active sites than the microporous materials. These additional active sites are likely located on both the external surface and inside the interparticle mesopores where the unit cells of the MIL-125 crystals are truncated leading to the formation of unsaturated metal centers.", "Figure 7.

The VAC-synthesized MIL-125 showed similar properties to a solvothermally synthesized analogue. The VAC method could then be adapted to add interparticle mesoporosity to MIL-125 through the use of a surfactant (CTAB). The surfactant likely acted as a capping agent creating confined local environments of MOF precursors, which then crystallized and formed mesoporous aggregates of nanosized MOF particles. This synthetic method marked a significant achievement because it allowed for the synthesis of hierarchical microporous/mesoporous MIL-125 without the use of a chelating agent. Moreover, the importance of the VAC method was emphasized because the addition of mesoporosity could not be easily accomplished using typical solvothermal methods. Catalytic tests in the oxidation of an aromatic sulfur compound (DBT) demonstrated the hierarchical MIL-125 displayed a marked enhancement in activity over its microporous analogues. Normalization of initial reaction rates on accessible surface area in conjunction with thiophene studies indicated that the enhancement in catalytic activity was due to the addition of mesoporosity rather than the formation of different active sites. Furthermore, thiophene adsorption studies suggested that the surfactant modified VAC method could lead to exposure of additional active sites resulting in higher measured catalytic activities.", " ", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results and Discussion", "Conclusion", "References", "Supporting Information", "Schematic of precursor gel preparation, powder XRD patterns for microporous MIL-125 synthesized via VAC, N", "2", " physisorption isotherms of microporous MIL-125, powder XRD pattern of mesoporous MIL-125, TEM of mesoporous MIL-125, TGA data for microporous and mesoporous MIL-125, UV\u2013vis spectrum of mesoporous MIL-125, textural properties of MIL-125 synthesized solvothermally with CTAB, pore size distribution of solvothermally synthesized MIL-125 with CTAB, catalytic recycle studies for mesoporous MIL-125, XRD pattern of mesoporous MIL-125 after recycle.

The assembly of metal ions with org. ligands through the formation of coordination bonds gives cryst. framework materials, known as metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), which recently emerged as a new class of porous materials.  Besides the structural designability of MOFs at the mol. length scale, the researchers in this field very recently made important advances in creating more complex architectures at the mesoscopic/macroscopic scale, in which MOF nanocrystals were used as building units to construct higher-order superstructures.  The structuring of MOFs in such a hierarchical order certainly opens a new opportunity to improve the material performance via design of the phys. form rather than altering the chem. component.  This review highlights these superstructures and their applications by categorizing them into four dimensionalities, zero-dimensional (0D), 1-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) superstructures.

The particle size of the \u03b2-zeolites depends on the concn. and type of counter-anion of the surfactant used.

The catalytic activity of the samples for hexene epoxidn. at 353 K increased with increasing silica content.  Since the fraction of tetrahedral Ti atoms in the samples also increased with silica content, the active site for the reaction is proposed to be a tetrahedrally coordinated Ti atom in a silica matrix.  Polar solvents like water, acetone, and methanol inhibited the peroxidn. reaction.  To investigate the effect of pore size on activity, mesoporous Ti-Si mixed oxides analogous to MCM-41 were synthesized.  The mesoporous samples were the most active and selective catalysts for epoxidn. with TBHP, presumably due to the ease of access of the reactants to the active Ti sites.  Results from EXAFS and UV reflectance spectroscopy indicated that Ti atoms in the mesoporous mixed oxides are tetrahedrally coordinated to oxygen atoms with the same Ti-O bond distance as TS-1.  However, the activities of our mesoporous samples are orders of magnitude lower than that of TS-1 for hexene epoxidn. with aq. hydrogen peroxide.

To achieve this, we synthesized a series of mesoporous Ti-SBA-15 catalysts according to a new procedure.  The procedure is based on the controlled grafting of titanium chelates on SBA-15 silica at low temps. (5 \u00b0C).  This specific synthesis procedure ensured a high dispersion of the required 4-coordinate tetrahedral Ti4+ sites located on the mesopore surface.  To substantiate the influence of the titanium content and mesopore size on the ODS performance of the catalysts, the parameters were varied in the range of 0.7 to 4.7 mol % (Si/Ti) and 5.1 to 9.0 nm, resp.  The resulting Ti-SBA-15 catalysts were then tested in the oxidative desulfurization (ODS) of model sulfur-contg. compds. in the presence of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) as the org. oxidant.  The ODS of a real industrial diesel fuel was also carried out in a continuous fixed bed reactor with the same Ti-SBA-15 catalysts and CHP.  The catalytic results revealed that the Ti-SBA-15 catalysts with the largest pore sizes (>7.3 nm) and highest Ti contents (>2.8 mol %) were highly active catalysts for ODS reactions.  Moreover, the catalysts with large pores and high Ti loadings appeared to be stable for over 30 h and were far less prone to deactivation than their equiv. Ti-SBA-15 samples with smaller pore diams. and lower Ti contents.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xjt1yhsrk%253D&md5=c11d5ef9af8b950d6d6597b89e6368cb", "44.

Such deep desulfurization levels can be achieved by catalytic hydrodesulfurization processes, but they are accompanied by excessive H2 consumption for unwanted side reactions, in particular, for the hydrogenation of olefins.  Selective adsorption constitutes an attractive alternative to catalytic desulfurization.  The main challenge is to find adsorbents able to remove the sulfur compds. with very high selectivity from a complex mixt. of paraffins, naphthenes, olefins, and arom. compds.  In the present contribution we present the screening of a large no. of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) for this purpose, using batch adsorption expts.

The GCMC simulations provide a better understanding of the effect of non-framework sodium atoms on the selective adsorption of binary mixts. of thiophene and benzene by these zeolite structures.
