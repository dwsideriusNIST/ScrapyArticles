The MOF materials were developed to provide a large reversible hydrogen-storage capacity leading to as much as 73% free volume. However, the NTE properties suggest other possible applications. Thus, their porous but constrained three-dimensional framework provides a framework onto which other materials might blend to form composites with negligible volume change with temperature. To illustrate this, we incorporated polyethylene polymers into MOF-C10 and found that the volume of the composite is constant within 0.059% over the entire range from 300 to 600 K.

The authors have carried out x-ray-absorption fine-structure (XAFS) expts. at both the W LIII edge and Zr K edge to study the detailed local structure in ZrW2O8.  XAFS results show a very small temp. dependence of the broadening parameter, \u03c3, for the W-Zr atom pair and the W-O-Zr linkage; consequently, the displacements of the W, O, and Zr atoms must be correlated.  The data show a much larger temp. dependence of \u03c3 for the nearest W1-W2 pair as well as for the nearest Zr-Zr pair.  These combined results indicate that it is the correlated motion of a WO4 tetrahedron and its 3 nearest ZrO6 octahedra that leads to the NTE effect in this material instead of primarily transverse vibrations of the middle O atom in the W-O-Zr linkage.  The data for both W-W and Zr-Zr atom pairs also indicate a hardening of the effective spring const. near 100 K, which is consistent with the shift of the lowest mode with T in the phonon d. of states.
