One isomer (1) showed an overall 4-fold interpenetrated uninodal 4-connected diamond network with Zt = 1 and Zn = 2 (class IIa).  The other (2) showed a 4-fold interpenetrated uninodal 4-connected diamond network with Zt = 2 and Zn = 2 (class IIIa).  Thus, despite the same metal-ligand connectivity, 1 and 2 are unusual isomeric MOFs based on the ways of catenation.  This may be accounted for by the flexible bonding nature of the In-centered pseudotetrahedral motif in the presence of countercations with different dimensions.

The In-MOF 1 showed a reversible framework transformation from cryst. form amorphized form (after activation)cryst. state (after resolvation).

Complex 1 features a three-dimensional (3D) framework possessing one-dimensional (1D) rhombic channels with dimensions of 13 \u00d7 13 \u00c52.  The 3D framework is built up from 1D PbO2 chains that link ligands in parallel fashion to construct single-wall channels.  When recrystg. 1 in a DMSO-DMF mixt. (3:5 vol./vol.), a new coordination polymer, [PbL2]\u00b7DMF\u00b72H2O (2), was obtained.  Complex 2 is also a 3D framework contg. 1D rectangular channels, but the channel dimensions become reduced in size to 13 \u00d7 8 \u00c52 due to reorganization of the Pb(II) coordination environment.  The PbO2 chains in 2 are reformed to link ligands in a double-wall fashion, significantly reducing the channel size.  Even though, the guest exchange study indicates that the DMF mols. in 2 could be replaced with benzene mols. when immersing in benzene solvent, showing single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC-SC) guest exchange in the solid state and leading to a daughter crystal [PbL2]\u00b70.5C6H6\u00b72H2O (2').  Desolvated 1 and 2 display preferential adsorption behaviors of water vapor over CO2 due to the hydrophilic nature of the channels and the strong host-guest interactions.  Catalytic tests indicate that desolvated 1 and 2 have size-selective catalytic activity towards the Knoevenagel condensation reaction.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhtFKns7fP&md5=d8960ff8e8ba5aebff0e2b2c0254c395", "8.

In a series of macrocyclic ligands where O donors are successively replaced by N donors, when 3 or 4 N atoms are present, there is a sudden marked increase in the rate of change of complex stability per N donor added.  This is attributed to a change from a stereochem. inactive lone pair with approx. \u22642 N donors present, to an active lone pair.  Below the transition point, the Pb(II) ion behaves as a large metal ion with rather ionic M-L bonding.  In this state it responds to added O-donor bearing groups as expected for such a metal ion.  Thus, the size-related selectivity patterns of Pb(II) with the ligand DAK-22 (4,7,13,16-tetraoxa-1,10-diazacyclooctadecane-N,N'-diacetate) are as expected for its size.  The protonation consts. and formation consts. of DAK-22 with several metal ions are reported.  For the complexes formed by 12-aneN4 (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane) and 12-aneN3O (1-oxa-4,7,10-triazacyclododecane) the Pb(II) appears to have a stereochem. active lone pair.  Thus, when N-(2-hydroxypropyl) groups are added to 12-aneN4 and 12-aneN3O to give the ligands THP-12-aneN4 and THP-12-aneN3O, resp., the Pb(II) ion does not respond to the added hydroxyalkyl groups as might have been expected.  It behaves as a smaller more covalent ion, and a study of the formation consts. of THP-12-aneN4 and THP-12-aneN3O with Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), Ca(II), Sr(II) and Ba(II) reveals lower than anticipated Pb/Zn selectivities.  A crystallog. study of [Pb(THP-12-aneN4)](NO3)2.PrOH reveals that there is space between the O donors for a stereochem. active lone pair, but the lack of shortening of the Pb-N bonds suggests that the lone pair is not active.  The complex crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Pnma, with a 10.352(8), b 14.781(2), c 21.850(4) \u00c5, Z = 4, R = 0.056.  Although the ligand THP-12-aneN4 has 4 chiral C atoms, the crystal structure suggests that only the RRRR and SSSS enantiomers of the free ligand are obtained after recrystn. from hexane.  The structure indicates that the [Pb(THP-12-aneN4)]2+ cations are disordered, with 50% site occupancy by the RRRR and by the SSSS conformer.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaL1MXhtVKqu7c%253D&md5=e0e4b804a77b64bb4198a94013610e39", "(b) ", "Cai", ", ", "S.

These materials are traditionally prepd. by hydrothermal means, in the presence of org. amines, but the reactions of amine phosphates with metal ions provide a facile route for the synthesis, and also throw some light on the mode of formation of these fascinating architectures.  Careful studies of the transformations of monophasic zinc phosphates of well-characterized structures show that the 1-dimensional structures transform to 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional structures, while the 2-dimensional structures transform to 3-dimensional structures.  The zero-dimensional monomers transform to 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, and 3-dimensional structures.  There is reason to believe that the 0-dimensional monomers, comprising four-membered rings, are the most basic structural units of the open-framework phosphates and that after an optimal precursor state, such as the ladder structure, is formed, further building may occur spontaneously.  Evidence for the occurrence of self-assembly in the formation of complex structures is provided by the presence of the structural features of the 1-dimensional starting material in the final products.
