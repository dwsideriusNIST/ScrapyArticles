All metal-O distances vary approx. linearly with both temp. (23\u00b0-1000\u00b0) and pressure (<100 kbar). and mean coeffs. of metal-O bond expansion and compression are proposed.  Two empirical relations between bond expansion, compression, and other bonding variables are: (1) \u03b1 = 32.9(0.75 - z/p) \u00d7 10-6/degree and (2) \u03b2 = 37.0(do3/z) \u00d7 10-6/kbar, where z is the cation charge, P the cation coordination no., do the mean polyhedral metal-O distance at 1 atm and 23\u00b0, \u03b1 the mean coeff.of linear expansion from 23-1000\u00b0 and \u03b2 the mean coeff. of linear compression <100 kbar.  For many cation polyhedra, including IVSi4+, VI Al3+, IVBe2+,VIMg2+,VIFe2+,VINi2+, and VICo2+, the obsd. ratio \u03b1/\u03b2 is approx. const.  Consequently, for minerals contg. these cations, bond-length changes during thermal expansion will be the inverse of those during compression.  Using the 2 empirical relations it is possible to predict bond compressions and expansions for other cation polyhedra, and thus provide a basis for estg. structural variations with temp. and pressure for many O-based minerals.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaE2sXhvFamtbs%253D&md5=5dae8bfbb52bfe0f2472e3b5d2a12839", "9.

In this way, many errors in published papers can be avoided.  The validation software generates a set of ALERTS detailing issues to be addressed by the experimenter, author, referee and publication journal.  Validation was pioneered by the IUCr journal Acta Crystallographica Section C and is currently std. procedure for structures submitted for publication in all IUCr journals.  The implementation of validation procedures by other journals is in progress.  This paper describes the concepts of validation and the classes of checks that are carried out by the program PLATON as part of the IUCr check CIF facility.  PLATON validation can be run at any stage of the structure refinement, independent of the structure detn. package used, and is recommended for use as a routine tool during or at least at the completion of every structure detn.
