However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "6.

PSMet was applied to enhance the performance characteristics of parent MOFs for gas storage and sepn., and catalysis.  Notably, PSMet is a prominent strategy in the field of MOF catalysis as it offers a route to design size-selective catalysts, based on the premise of reticular chem. in MOFs and the ability to incorporate a range of catalytically-active metal centers.  Other applications for materials produced via or using PSMet strategies include enhancing gas storage or mol. sepns., the triggered release of drugs, sensing and tunable light emission for luminescent materials.

The main existing CO2 capture technologies are discussed in the context of capture performance considerations of aq. alkanolamine solns. and porous solids such as zeolites and activated carbons.  Schematic diagrams are presented of idealized temp. swing adsorption, pressure swing adsorption, and vacuum swing adsorption processes for regenerating solid adsorbent in a fixed-bed column.  The structural features and CO2 adsorption characteristics of isoreticular metal-org. frameworks (MOF) are discussed in detail.  The high-pressure adsorption capacities of 36 MOF and the lower-pressure adsorption capacities of many more MOF, at 293-319 K, are tabulated.  The various types of functionalities that have been explored to date for prepg. materials with enhanced CO2 capture performance are outlined, including amines, strongly polarizing org. functionalities, and exposed metal cation sites.  The synthesis of continuous films of MOF and their use in membranes for gas sepn. are examd., with the tabulation of the CO2 sepn. performance of MOF mixed-matrix membranes.  A final section outlines main issues that need to be addressed to achieve next-generation materials capable of fulfilling the criteria required for the gas sepns. relevant to post-combustion CO2 capture, pre-combustion CO2 capture, and oxy-fuel combustion.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhs12hsLzE&md5=eb8236e7dfe12981387c71415374f958", "30.
