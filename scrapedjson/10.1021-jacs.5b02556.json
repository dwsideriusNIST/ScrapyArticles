The total world energy demand is predicted to rise significantly over the next few decades, primarily driven by the continuous growth of the developing world.  With rapid depletion of nonrenewable traditional fossil fuels, which currently account for almost 86% of the worldwide energy output, the search for viable alternative energy resources is becoming more important from a national security and economic development standpoint.  Nuclear energy, an emission-free, high-energy-d. source produced by means of controlled nuclear fission, is often considered as a clean, affordable alternative to fossil fuel.  However, the successful installation of an efficient and economically viable industrial-scale process to properly sequester and mitigate the nuclear-fission-related, highly radioactive waste (e.g., used nuclear fuel (UNF)) is a prerequisite for any further development of nuclear energy in the near future.  Reprocessing of UNF is often considered to be a logical way to minimize the vol. of high-level radioactive waste, though the generation of volatile radionuclides during reprocessing raises a significant engineering challenge for its successful implementation.  The volatile radionuclides include but are not limited to noble gases (predominately isotopes of Xe and Kr) and must be captured during the process to avoid being released into the environment.  Currently, energy-intensive cryogenic distn. is the primary means to capture and sep. radioactive noble gas isotopes during UNF reprocessing.  A similar cryogenic process is implemented during com. prodn. of noble gases though removal from air.  In light of their high com. values, particularly in lighting and medical industries, and assocd. high prodn. costs, alternate approaches for Xe/Kr capture and storage are of contemporary research interest.  The proposed pathways for Xe/Kr removal and capture can essentially be divided in two categories: selective absorption by dissoln. in solvents and physisorption on porous materials.  Physisorption-based sepn. and adsorption on highly functional porous materials are promising alternatives to the energy-intensive cryogenic distn. process, where the adsorbents are characterized by high surface areas and thus high removal capacities and often can be chem. fine-tuned to enhance the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions for optimum selectivity.  Several traditional porous adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbon have been tested for noble gas capture but have shown low capacity, selectivity, and lack of modularity.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are an emerging class of solid-state adsorbents that can be tailor-made for applications ranging from gas adsorption and sepn. to catalysis and sensing.  Herein we give a concise summary of the background and development of Xe/Kr sepn. technologies with a focus on UNF reprocessing and the prospects of MOF-based adsorbents for that particular application.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXitVeksrfO&md5=8f48b55298dd545f043ef1b31aa9a5d1", "2.

The synthesis of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) has attracted immense attention during the last 2 decades due to the possibility to obtain a large variety of aesthetically interesting structures that could also be of great interest for applications in a no. of fields related to porous materials.  This includes the more traditional areas of storage, sepn., and catalysis, which are based on the pore size and shape as well as the host guest interactions involved.  In addn., biomedical applications or the use as sensor materials are currently intensively investigated.  Although MOF synthesis was originally set out for making new compds. and structures with interesting properties, the field has matured and is broadening its scope.  This holds for the synthesis methods applied as well as the areas of application.  While conventional syntheses methods have been widely used, the fields of mechano-, sono-, and electrochem. synthesis as well as microwave-assisted syntheses are just emerging. They have demonstrated to be applicable for some compds., often under milder reaction conditions, yielding materials with different particle sizes and properties.

Here, we applied high-throughput computational methods to rapidly explore thousands of possible MOFs, given a library of starting materials, in the context of Xe/Kr sepn.  We generated over 137 000 structurally diverse hypothetical MOFs from a library of chem. building blocks and screened them for Xe/Kr sepn.

Frameworks (MOFs) contg. open metal sites (OMS) was systematically studied using volumetric gas porosimetry and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation.  The ten MOFs considered are grouped into two series.  The 1st, MOF-74-x, is based upon MOF-74/CPO-27, which has divalent metal ions Mg, Co, Ni, and Zn, and was chosen to explore the effect of metal identity within a const. topol.  The 2nd series, nbo-MOFs, consists of NOTT-100, NOTT-101, NOTT-102, NOTT-103, and PCN-14 and probes the effect of pore size while maintaining const. OMS identity and similar coordination environment.  Comparisons of the nbo-MOFs with HKUST-1 are also made, since this MOF has a similar chem. structure, although the topol. is different from the nbo structures.  Gas uptake and Henry's const. (kH) for nbo-MOFs increase with decreasing pore size, and as pore size decreases, the effect of gas polarizability on kH becomes more profound.  This implies that tailored pore size can strongly influence kH, esp. for the more polarizable gases Kr and Xe.  A detailed anal. of the void space in the nbo-series reveals large cages connected by narrow pores, resulting in tortuous, zigzag diffusion pathways that likely increase the strength of the MOF-gas interaction.  Data for the MOF-74-x series show that both the d. of OMS and their accessibility in this topol. enhance the framework interaction with the noble gases.  However, because the interaction is largely due to (point charge)-(induced-dipole) interactions and the charge on the metal ion varies little, the specific identity of the metal ion is relatively unimportant.  Consequently, new MOFs tailored to maximize noble gas uptake from air should target structures with both a high d. of OMS and pores that are approaching the size of the gas of interest.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXos1Wltb0%253D&md5=afe2dd4e7052e771e1c3bc27cd2446ae", "7.

Controllable integration of MOFs and functional materials is leading to the creation of new multifunctional composites/hybrids, which exhibit new properties that are superior to those of the individual components through the collective behavior of the functional units.  This is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research area.
