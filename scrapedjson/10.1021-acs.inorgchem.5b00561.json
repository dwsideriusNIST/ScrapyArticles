The challenge of developing effective sepn. and purifn. technologies which have much smaller energy footprints is greater for CO2 than for other gases; in addn. to its involvement in climate change, CO2 is an impurity in natural gas, biogas (biomass-based natural gas), syngas (CO/H2, the main H2 source for refineries), and many other gas streams.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) -highly cryst. hybrid materials that combine metal ions with rigid org. ligands- have emerged as an important class of porous materials.  The org. ligands add flexibility and diversity to the chem. structures and functions of these materials.  In this Account, we summarize our lab.'s experience in tuning the topol. and functionality of MOFs by ligand design.  These investigations have led to new materials with interesting properties.  By using a ligand that can adopt different symmetry conformations through free internal bond rotation, we have obtained two MOFs that are supramol. stereoisomers of each other at different reaction temps.  In another case, where the dimerized ligands function as a D3-Piedfort unit spacer, we achieve chiral (10,3)-a networks.  In the design of MOF-based materials for hydrogen and methane storage, we focused on increasing the gas affinity of frameworks by using ligands with different geometries to control the pore size and effectively introduce unsatd. metal centers (UMCs) into the framework.  Framework interpenetration in PCN-6 (PCN stands for porous coordination network) can lead to higher hydrogen uptake.  Because of the proper alignment of the UMCs, PCN-12 holds the record for uptake of hydrogen at 77 K/760 Torr.  In the case of methane storage, PCN-14 with anthracene-derived ligand achieves breakthrough storage capacity, at a level 28% higher than the U.S. Department of Energy target.  Selective gas adsorption requires a pore size comparable to that of the target gas mols.; therefore, we use bulky ligands and network interpenetration to reduce the pore size.  In addn., with the help of an amphiphilic ligand, we were able to use temp. to continuously change pore size in a 2D layer MOF.  Adding charge to an org. ligand can also stabilize frameworks.  By ionizing the amine group within mesoMOF-1, the resulting electronic repulsion keeps the network from collapsing, giving rise to the first case of mesoporous MOF that demonstrates the type IV isotherm.  We use dendritic hexacarboxylate ligands to synthesize an isoreticular series of MOFs with (3,24)-connected network topol.  The cuboctahedral cages serve as building blocks that narrow the opening of the mesocavities into microwindows and stabilize these MOFs.  The resulting materials have exceptionally high surface areas and hydrogen uptake capacities.  Despite the many achievements in MOF development, there is still ample opportunity for further exploration.  We will be continuing our efforts and look forward to contributing to this blossoming field in the next decade.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhsV2ksbfO&md5=f17f81d99259e7ee659b30bcc2ddeea2", "23.

(NiBpeneNiCN).  The hysteresis occurs under moderate pressure and at temps. above the crit. temps. of the resp. gases.  Powder X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that the material is an extended three-dimensional analog of the well-known Hofmann clathrates which is formed through axial bridging of the in-plane octahedral Ni sites by the bidentate 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene.  The hysteretic behavior toward guest adsorption and desorption is attributed to a structural phase transition in the material resulting from a variation in the tilt angle of the 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene pillars.  Kinetics studies on the desorption of acetone from the material show two first-order processes with two rate consts. yielding activation energies of 68 and 55 kJ/mol when loadings are greater than 1 equiv of acetone per formula unit.  The CO2 adsorption/desorption isotherms on the series of structurally similar Ni(L)[Ni(CN)4] compds., where L = pyrazine, 4,4'-bipyridine, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, and dipyridylacetylene, are also reported.  In contrast to NiBpeneNiCN, the rigid members of this series show normal type I isotherms with no measureable hysteresis and no significant structural changes during the adsorption/desorption cycle, while the flexible 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane-bridged sample collapses in the guest-free state and shows no significant adsorption of CO2.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhtVeitL%252FO&md5=4c8956e1cff84d9b34634b4f13663498", "40.

The 1st isomer, with a paddle-wheel-type Cd2(COO)4 secondary building unit (SBU), is flexible, whereas the other isomer has a rigid framework based on a \u03bc-oxo-bridged Cd2(\u03bc-OCO)2 SBU.  Both frameworks are 2-fold interpenetrated and the pore surface is decorated with pendant -NH2 and =N-N= functional groups.  Both the frameworks are nonporous to N2, revealed by the type II adsorption profiles.  However, at 195 K, the 1st isomer shows an unusual double-step hysteretic CO2 adsorption profile, whereas the 2nd isomer shows a typical type I CO2 profile.  Also, at 195 K, both frameworks show excellent selectivity for CO2 among other gases (N2, O2, H2, and Ar), which has been correlated to the specific interaction of CO2 with the -NH2 and =N-N= functionalized pore surface.  DFT calcns. for the oxo-bridged isomer unveiled that the -NH2 group is the primary binding site for CO2.  The high heat of CO2 adsorption (\u0394Hads = 37.7 kJ mol-1) in the oxo-bridged isomer is realized by NH2-CO2/arom. \u03c0-CO2 and cooperative CO2-CO2 interactions.  Further, postsynthetic modification of the -NH2 group into -NHCOMe in the 2nd isomer leads to a reduced CO2 uptake with lower binding energy, which establishes the crit. role of the -NH2 group for CO2 capture.  The presence of basic -NH2 sites in the oxo-bridged isomer was further exploited for efficient catalytic activity in a Knoevenagel condensation reaction.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXjtl2isbk%253D&md5=3ad6b2bccad9dcaa74ca336e1fdc9191", "46.
