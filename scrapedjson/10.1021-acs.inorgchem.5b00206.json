In modern anal. chem. researchers pursue novel materials to meet anal. challenges such as improvements in sensitivity, selectivity, and detection limit.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of microporous materials, and their unusual properties such as high surface area, good thermal stability, uniform structured nanoscale cavities, and the availability of in-pore functionality and outer-surface modification are attractive for diverse anal. applications.  This Account summarizes the research on the anal. applications of MOFs ranging from sampling to chromatog. sepn.  MOFs were either directly used or engineered to meet the demands of various anal. applications.  Bulk MOFs with microsized crystals are convenient sorbents for direct application to in-field sampling and solid-phase extn.  Quartz tubes packed with MOF-5 showed excellent stability, adsorption efficiency, and reproducibility for in-field sampling and trapping of atm. formaldehyde.  The 2-dimensional copper(II) isonicotinate packed microcolumn demonstrated large enhancement factors and good shape- and size-selectivity when applied to online solid-phase extn. of polycyclic arom. hydrocarbons in water samples.  The authors have explored the mol. sieving effect of MOFs for the efficient enrichment of peptides with simultaneous exclusion of proteins from biol. fluids.  These results show promise for the future of MOFs in peptidomics research.  Also, nanosized MOFs and engineered thin films of MOFs are promising materials as novel coatings for solid-phase microextn.  The authors have developed an in situ hydrothermal growth approach to fabricate thin films of MOF-199 on etched stainless steel wire for solid-phase microextn. of volatile benzene homologs with large enhancement factors and wide linearity.  Their high thermal stability and easy-to-engineer nanocrystals make MOFs attractive as new stationary phases to fabricate MOF-coated capillaries for high-resoln. gas chromatog. (GC).  The authors have explored a dynamic coating approach to fabricate a MOF-coated capillary for the GC sepn. of important raw chems. and persistent org. pollutants with high resoln. and excellent selectivity.  The authors have combined a MOF-coated fiber for solid-phase microextn. with a MOF-coated capillary for GC sepn., which provides an effective MOF-based tandem mol. sieve platform for selective microextn. and high-resoln. GC sepn. of target analytes in complex samples.  Microsized MOFs with good solvent stability are attractive stationary phases for HPLC.  These materials showed high resoln. and good selectivity and reproducibility in both the normal-phase HPLC sepn. of fullerenes and substituted aroms. on MIL-101 packed columns and position isomers on a MIL-53(Al) packed column and the reversed-phase HPLC sepn. of a wide range of analytes from nonpolar to polar and acidic to basic solutes.  Despite the above achievements, further exploration of MOFs in anal. chem. is needed.
