As the name suggests, MOFs are the hybrid compounds wherein metals are connected through organic linkers. Thus, MOF with desired ability and structure can be synthesized by changing organic linkers and/or metal centers. To find efficient MOFs for the capture of green house gases, many studies have been carried out [", "19", ", ", "20", ", ", "21", ", ", "22", ", ", "23", ", ", "24", "]. In such works, a lot of efforts have been made to confirm and estimate porosity required to selective absorption/adsorption of gases into MOFs and also the conditions under which such absorption/adsorption of gas occurs [", "25", ", ", "26", ", ", "27", ", ", "28", ", ", "29", "].", "However, theoretical studies of the interaction of gases such as H", "2", ", CO", "2", ", and CH", "4", " with MOFs have been limited so far. In a pioneering study of the interaction of H", "2", " with MOF-5, Sagara et al. [", "30", ", ", "31", "] calculated the binding energy of 6\u20137\u00a0kJ/mol at the corner site (metal site) and 4\u20135\u00a0kJ/mol at the linker site with MP2 theory. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations by Lee et al. [", "32", "] suggest that the interaction of H", "2", " with model system (benzene) is significantly different from that with actual MOF-5 framework. Also, the interaction of CO", "2", " with simple alcohols, ketones, esters, and amines has been investigated [", "33", ", ", "34", ", ", "35", ", ", "36", ", ", "37", ", ", "38", "]. These studies suggest that the formation of a hydrogen bond is a driving force for the stabilization of these complexes. More realistic system was explored with ONIOM(MP2/6-31G(d,p):HF/6-31G(d,p)) method by Pianwanit et al. [", "39", "]. They concluded that in MOF-5, both CO", "2", " and CH", "4", " occupy the perpendicular position to the ZnO", "4", " corner with the binding energies of 9.27 and 3.64\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively. Recently, many MOFs with nitrogen containing organic linkers are reported in an attempt to form stronger interaction between the carbon of CO", "2", " and the nitrogen of the linker [", "29", ", ", "40", "]. For instance, Vogiatzis et al. [", "40", "] investigated the interaction between CO", "2", " and the N-containing organic heterocycles with CCSD(T), where the binding energy at complete basis set limit is approximately evaluated by the MP2-F12 method with 6-311++G(d,p) and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. They reported that the DFT-D method [", "41", ", ", "42", "] with PBS functional provides binding energies similar to the values calculated by the CCSD(T) method with MP2-F12-calculated basis set extension effects and recommended the use of the basis sets augmented with diffuse functions (e.g., aug-cc-pVTZ) [", "40", "]. One of the present authors also theoretically investigated the interactions of CO", "2", " and CS", "2", " with pyrazine and found that the binding energy of CO", "2", " is somewhat less than that of CS", "2", " [", "29", "]. In the above mentioned theoretical studies, efforts were made to examine the methodology, the model system, and the value of binding energy. Though such knowledge is indispensible in the theoretical study of MOF, it is also important to find determining factors for the interaction between gas molecule and MOF.", "In the present work, we theoretically investigated the interaction of gas molecules such as H", "2", ", CO", "2", ", C", "2", "H", "4", ", C", "2", "H", "6", ", and CS", "2", " with two pyrazine (Pz) molecules, which are organic linker of the recently reported Hofmann-type MOF {Fe(Pz)[Pt(CN)", "4", "]}", " ", "n", " ", " [", "29", "]. This Hofmann-type MOF is of considerable interest because the spin state conversion occurs by the adsorption of some of gas molecules [", "29", "]; for instance, CS", "2", " induces the conversion from high spin to low spin, but CO", "2", " does not. Thus, the interaction energy between the gas molecule and this MOF is important to control molecular property of this MOF. Though the interaction of CO", "2", " with the N atom of Pz was theoretically investigated well recently [", "40", "], gas molecule approaches not the N atom of Pz but the six-member ring of Pz in this MOF; see Scheme\u00a0", "1", " [", "29", "]. This is because the metal atom coordinates with the N atoms of Pz. We employed this MOF here because the position of gas molecule was clearly shown by recent X-ray analysis; see also Scheme\u00a0", "1", " [", "29", "]. First, we examined the suitable level of theory as well as basis set because the approach of gas molecule to the six-member ring of Pz has not been theoretically investigated yet. Then, we theoretically evaluated the binding energies of such gas molecules as H", "2", ", CO", "2", ", C", "2", "H", "4", ", C", "2", "H", "6", ", and CS", "2", " with two pyrazine (Pz) molecules. One interesting issue here is to make comparison between the binding energy of gas molecule sandwiched by two Pz molecules and that of gas molecule with one Pz. Also, it is interesting to investigate whether the relation between binding energy and molecular property exists or not. We wish to provide theoretical answers to above mentioned issues.", " ", "Open image in new window", " ", "Scheme\u00a01", " ", "The Schematic picture of the Hoffmann-type metal\u2013organic framework; Ref.

The recently proposed MP2.5 method [", "45", "], which corresponds to the arithmetic mean of MP2 and MP3-calculated values, was also employed here. The basis set extension effects from aug-cc-pVDZ to aug-cc-pVTZ were evaluated at MP2 and MP2.5 levels. Molecular properties such as quadrupole moment and polarizability were calculated by the DFT method with B3LYP functional, employing aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. Counterpoise correction (CPC) [", "46", "] was made to consider the basis set superposition error (BSSE) in the binding energy. The Kitaura\u2013Morokuma energy decomposition analysis (EDA) [", "47", "] was carried out with the reduced variational space (RVS) scheme [", "48", ", ", "49", "]. The binding energy and molecular properties were calculated with the Gaussian 03 [", "50", "] program, and the EDA was performed with GAMESS program package [", "51", "].", "3 ", "Results and discussion", "3.1 ", "Suitable level of theory and basis set", "We first scanned the potential energy surface (PES) at different levels of theory and basis set to find the suitable level of theory for this type of interaction. The PESs for such two systems as Pz\u2013CO", "2", " and Pz\u2013CS", "2", " are shown in Fig.\u00a0", "1", ", where the CO", "2", " and CS", "2", " are moved perpendicular to the six-member ring of Pz to mimic the experimental geometry [", "29", "]. Note that the negative value of the binding energy represents the energy stabilization. The PESs at different levels are compared with the CCSD(T) values, shown in the left-hand side of Fig.\u00a0", "1", ". As is clear from these PESs, the binding energy is considerably overestimated at the MP2 level, whereas it is underestimated at the MP3 level. Though the binding energy at the MP4(SDQ) level is moderately larger (more negative) than that at the MP3 level, the MP4(SDQ)-calculated PES is still considerably above the CCSD(T) values. The PES calculated at the MP2.5 level is close to that obtained at the CCSD(T) level. The effect of basis set on the binding energy is examined, shown in the right-hand side of Fig.\u00a0", "1", ". Here, the basis set extension effect was evaluated at the MP2 and MP2.5 levels. As seen in Fig.\u00a0", "1", ", when the basis set changes from aug-cc-pVDZ to aug-cc-pVTZ, the PES becomes considerably lower, suggesting that the use of aug-cc-pVTZ is necessary at least. However, the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ calculation is computationally demanding. Thus, the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ method is employed here as a reference, in which the basis set extension effect from aug-cc-pVDZ to aug-cc-pVTZ is evaluated with the MP2.5 method. This method is named hereafter as CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ\u00a0+\u00a0MP2.5{aug-cc-pVTZ\u00a0\u2212\u00a0aug-cc-pVDZ}. We found that the MP2.5/aug-cc-pVTZ-calculated PES is close to the PES calculated at the reference level, as shown in Fig.\u00a0", "1", "; though MP2.5/aug-cc-pVQZ method was recommended for evaluation of the dispersion interaction [", "52", "], the Pz\u2013gas\u2013Pz system is too large to perform MP2.5/aug-cc-pVQZ calculation.", " ", "Open image in new window", " ", "Fig.\u00a01", " ", "Comparison of potential energy surfaces of ", "a", " Pz\u2013CO", "2", " and ", "b", " Pz\u2013CS", "2", " calculated at different levels of theory and basis sets", " ", " ", "In Table\u00a0", "1", ", the minimum positions of these PESs are listed with the binding energies at the minima.
