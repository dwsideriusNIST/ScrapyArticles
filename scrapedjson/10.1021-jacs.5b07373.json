Because Cr(III) salts often yield insoluble formates due to DMF decomposition with long reaction time at high temperature, the reaction time was limited to preserve crystallinity and porosity while maintaining a high metal exchange ratio.

Interestingly, both PCN-333(Sc) and PCN-333(Fe) showed no apparent color changes upon metathesis at 85 \u00b0C (", "Figure ", "2", "b,c). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra revealed low exchange ratios of both samples (37.0% for PCN-333(Sc/Cr) and 23.0% for PCN-333(Fe/Cr)), and especially poor powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of PCN-333(Sc) (", "Figure ", "2", "). Notably, PCN-333(Sc) showed slightly higher Cr(III) exchange ratio than that of PCN-333(Fe) at 85 \u00b0C, while showing no PXRD pattern, which suggests its lability, whereas at 150 \u00b0C, both samples generally showed much higher Cr(III) exchange ratios than those at lower temperature (64.8% for PCN-333(Sc/Cr) and 99.8% for PCN-333(Fe/Cr)). In particular, Cr(III) metathesis from PCN-333(Fe) showed near complete exchange along with well-maintained crystallinity and porosity, which were confirmed by PXRD (", "Figure ", "2", "c) and N", "2", " sorption at 77 K, respectively (", "Figure ", "3", "). On the other hand, the diffraction of PCN-333(Sc) almost completely disappeared after the Cr(III) metathesis. It is reasoned that these results are due to the discrepancy between dissociation rates of leaving metal species in the framework and incoming metal species from the solution. For instance, in our previous study of ligand exchange in PCN-333, the successful ligand exchange was carried out at low temperature (85 \u00b0C), which suggests it gives enough energy to overcome the energy barrier of Sc(III)\u2013carboxylate or Fe(III)\u2013carboxylate bond dissociations within the framework. Closely looking at the metal metathesis process, the M\u2013L bond dissociation is required for both incoming metal complex and metals in the parent MOF to accomplish the overall exchange process. Even though the temperature is sufficient enough for the ligand dissociation in the framework, much slower ligand dissociation in the incoming Cr(III) complex can still be a rate limiting step. Therefore, the Cr(III) metathesis at low temperature was not successful. On the other hand, when the given energy is enough for breaking Cr(III)\u2013X (i.e., Cl", "\u2013", ") bond from Cr(III) salts and following association with the open carboxylates in the framework after Fe(III) dissociation for successful exchange, Cr(III) exchange reached to higher exchange ratio in both cases (", "Figure ", "2", "a). When it comes to the retention of framework structure, however, the metathesis in PCN-333(Fe) was superior to PCN-333(Sc), presumably due to the relative robustness of PCN-333(Fe) resulting from the slower Fe(III)\u2013carboxylate dissociation rate than that of PCN-333(Sc) allowing compatible exchange environment with Cr(III) association. Particularly, in the metal metathesis of labile PCN-333(Sc) platform, the framework would undergo significant destruction by free Cr(III) and decomposed reactive species from DMF before obvious metal metathesis happened.", "(12)", " After discovering the previous result, PCN-333(Fe) was chosen as a platform for studying the dual exchange.", "3", "Analysis of Dual Exchange", "Following up on our previous study, exploring the chemical dynamics of ligand exchange in PCN-333,", "(16)", " we further sought to expand our observations and rationalizations focused on changes of entropy and enthalpy during the dual exchange. As was discussed in the previous study, the entropy change of the system (\u0394", "S", "sys", "), comprising a solid-state MOF and exchanging solution during the ligand exchange, was assumed to be largely dependent on \u0394", "S", " in solution, as \u0394", "S", " in the solid state MOF may be negligible (", "Supporting Information", " Section 9). Thus, the ligand exchange process in PCN-333 was driven by a drastic entropy increase (\u0394", "S", "sys", "LE", " > 0) upon the provision of excess amount of the exchanging ligands (", "Figure S11", "). Similarly, the entropy change of the system during the metal metathesis (\u0394", "S", "sys", "MM", ") follows the same concept (", "Figure ", "4", "); thus, it yields a positive \u0394", "S", "sys", "MM", " due to the excess input of Cr(III) in solution to replace Fe(III) in the framework.

For this reason, although the large \u0394", "S", "sys", " at the early stage of ligand exchange could drive the exchange reaction forward, the system establishes an equilibrium with a certain ratio of ligand exchange (", "Supporting Information", " Section 9).", "However, metal metathesis between Fe(III) and Cr(III) accompanies the changes in M\u2013L bond nature, comprising the framework, whereas the bond nature in the ligand exchange remains the same as Fe(III)\u2013L bond (L represents carboxylate) in the framework. Meanwhile, metal metathesis also involves changes of enthalpy in solution. For example, Fe(III) ions, coming out from the framework replace Cr(III) in the provided CrX", "6", " complex (X = Cl", "\u2013", ", DMF), resulting in FeX", "6", " species in solution. Consequently, there are two processes involving enthalpy changes of the system: (1) \u0394", "H", "Fe", ", corresponding to the enthalpy change of Fe(III) from the MOF to the solution; (2) \u0394", "H", "Cr", " corresponding to the enthalpy change of Cr(III) species from solution to the MOF.

Therefore, from the Cr(III) standpoint, as \u0394", "O", "L", " is larger, the system gets more stabilized.

Such high temperature not only provided sufficient energy for Cr(III)\u2013X bond dissociation, but also allowed a short reaction time, avoiding a long exposure of MOF in the reactive environment which further guarantees the framework intactness.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

DMOF-1-NH2 (DABCO MOF-1-NH2) is a deriv. of a previously studied MOF that contains two-dimensional square grids based on NH2-BDC and zinc(II) paddle-wheel units; the grid layers are connected by DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) mols. that coordinate in the axial positions of the paddlewheel secondary-building units (SBUs).

The structure of UMCM-1-NH2 was confirmed by single-crystal x-ray diffraction.  By using NH2-BDC to generate these MOFs, the pendant amino groups can serve as a chem. handle that can be manipulated via postsynthetic modification with alkyl anhydrides.  Reactions of each MOF and different anhydrides were performed to compare the extent of conversion, thermal and structural stability, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas afforded by the resulting materials.  Under comparable reaction conditions, 1H NMR of digested samples show that UMCM-1-NH2 has conversions comparable to that of IRMOF-3, while DMOF-1-NH2 only shows high conversions with smaller anhydrides.  Under specific reaction conditions, higher conversions were obtained with complete retention of crystallinity, as verified by single-crystal x-ray diffraction expts.  The results presented here demonstrate three important findings: (a) NH2-BDC can be used as a surrogate for BDC in a no. of MOFs thereby providing a handle for postsynthetic modification, (b) postsynthetic modification is a general strategy to functionalizing MOFs that can be applied to a variety of MOF structures, and (c) the topol. and chem./thermal stability of a MOF can influence the type of chem. reactions and reagents that can be used for postsynthetic modification.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhtl2ltb%252FJ&md5=4c92eadb89feb530b7c5983af853e95e", "(d) ", "Tanabe", ", ", "K.

However, the inexhaustible post-synthetic options to tailor zeolite properties have been and will continue to be indispensable to realize emerging and to improve conventional applications.  Starting from the routine drying and template removal processes that every zeolite must experience prior to use, a wide spectrum of treatments exists to alter individual or collective characteristics of these materials for optimal performance.  This review documents the toolbox of post-synthetic strategies available to tune the properties of zeolitic materials for specific functions.  The categorization is based on the scale at which the alteration is aimed at, including the at. structure (e.g. the introduction, dislodgement, or replacement of framework atoms), the micropore level (e.g. template removal and functionalization by inorg. and org. species), and the crystal and particle levels (e.g. the introduction of auxiliary porosity).

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous materials with many potential applications, which intimately depend on the presence of chem. functionality either at the org. linkers and/or at the metal nodes.  Functionality that cannot be introduced into MOFs directly via de novo syntheses can be accessed through post-synthesis modification (PSM) on the reactive moieties of the linkers and/or nodes without disrupting the metal-linker bonds.  Even more intriguing methods that go beyond PSM are herein termed building block replacement (BBR) which encompasses (i) solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE), (ii) nonbridging ligand replacement, and (iii) transmetalation.  These 1-step or tandem BBR processes involve exchanging key structural components of the MOF, which in turn should allow for the evolution of protoMOF structures (i.e., the use of a parent MOF as a template) to design MOFs composed of completely new components, presumably via single crystal to single crystal transformations.  The influence of building block replacement on the stability and properties of MOFs are discussed, and some insights into their mechanistic aspects are provided.

Substitution reaction, as one of the most powerful and efficient chem. reactions, has been widely used in various syntheses, including those for the design and prepn. of functional mols. or materials.  In the past decade, a class of newly developed inorg.-org. hybrid materials, namely metal-org. materials (MOMs), has experienced a rapid development.  MOMs are composed of metal-contg. nodes connected by org. linkers through strong chem. bonds, and can be divided into metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) and metal-org. polygons/polyhedra (MOPs) with infinite and discrete structural features, resp.  Recent research has shown that the substitution reaction can be used as a new strategy in the synthesis and modification of MOFs and MOPs, particularly for pre-designed ones with desired structures and functions, which are usually difficult to access by a direct one-pot self-assembly synthetic approach.  This review highlights the implementation of the substitution reaction in MOFs and MOPs.  Examples of substitution reactions at metal ions, org. ligands, and free guest mols. of MOFs and MOPs are listed and analyzed.  The changes or modifications in the structures and/or properties of these materials induced by the substitutions, as well as the nature of the assocd. reaction, are discussed, with the conclusion that the substitution reaction is really feasible and powerful in synthesizing and tailoring MOMs.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXmvFGmsbg%253D&md5=a814b2dc05481f6104b4dd51d4a7fa6b", "(t) ", "Hong", ", ", "D.

NMR, IR spectra, powder XRD, TEM, and mass spectra suggested that a terephthalate linker in UiO-66 was substituted by two alkanedioate moieties, resulting in free carboxyl pendants in the pores.  When post-synthetically modified UiO-66 was partially digested by adjusting the amt. of added HF per sample, NMR spectra indicated that the ratio of alkanedioic acid/terephthalic acid was increased with smaller amts. of acid, implying that the ligand substitution proceeded from the outer layer of the particles.  Gas sorption studies indicated that the surface areas and the pore vols. of all UiO-66-ADns were decreased compared to those of UiO-66, and that the CO2 adsorption capacities of UiO-66-ADn (n = 4, 8) were similar to that of UiO-66.  In the case of UiO-66-AD6, the CO2 uptake capacity was 34% higher at 298 K and 58% higher at 323 K compared to those of UiO-66.  It was elucidated by thermodn. calcns. that the introduction of flexible carboxyl pendants of appropriate length has two effects: (1) it increases the interaction enthalpy between the host framework and CO2 mols., and (2) it mitigates the entropy loss upon CO2 adsorption due to the formation of multiple configurations for the interactions between carboxyl groups and CO2 mols.  The ideal adsorption soln. theory (IAST) selectivity for CO2 adsorption over that of CH4 was enhanced for all of the UiO-66-ADns compared to that of UiO-66 at 298 K.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "(e) ", "Biswas", ", ", "S.", "; ", "Grzywa", ", ", "M.", "; ", "Nayek", ", ", "H.

Among the MOFs were 10 zirconium(IV) MOFs with a subset of these, MOF-801-SC (single crystal form), -802, -805, -806, -808, -812, and -841 reported for the first time.

MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized but not examd. for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of MOF-841 synthesis.  All the new zirconium MOFs are made from the Zr6O4(OH)4(-CO2) secondary building units (n = 6, 8, 10, or 12) and variously shaped carboxyl org. linkers to make extended porous frameworks.  The permanent porosity of all 23 materials was confirmed and their water adsorption measured to reveal that MOF-801-P and MOF-841 are the highest performers based on the three criteria stated above; they are water stable, do not lose capacity after five adsorption/desorption cycles, and are easily regenerated at room temp.

Cation exchange is an emerging synthetic route for modifying the secondary building units (SBUs) of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  This technique was used extensively to enhance the properties of nanocrystals and mols., but the extent of its applications for MOFs is still expanding.  To harness cation exchange as a rational tool, the authors need to elucidate its governing factors.  Not nearly enough exptl. observations exist for drawing these conclusions, so the authors provide a conceptual framework for approaching this task.  The authors address which SBUs undergo exchange, why certain ions replace others, how the framework influences the process, the role of the solvent, and current applications.
