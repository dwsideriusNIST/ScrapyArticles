Most of the MOFs have a three dimensional framework that encloses uniform pores which are interconnected to form an ordered network of channels [", "4", ", ", "5", "]. These materials can be synthesised in a wide range of varying topologies and pore sizes by the self assembly process of different combinations of organic linkers and metal nodules [", "6", "]. The crystalline nature, large tunable pores and high specific surface areas makes them attractive for many applications such as gas storage [", "7", ", ", "8", "], separations [", "9", "] and catalysis [", "10", "]. MOFs have attracted the attention of researchers in recent years in the field of hydrogen storage because of their high specific surface areas and functionalized pore walls [", "11", ", ", "12", ", ", "13", ", ", "14", "]. They have shown good uptake capacities for hydrogen only at cryogenic temperatures but unfortunately the room temperature hydrogen uptake capacities in MOFs are quite low and needs to be improved [", "15", ", ", "16", "].", "Various strategies have been explored by researchers to improve the hydrogen storage capacities in MOFs, such as framework catenation, impregnation and organic linker functionalization etc. [", "17", "]. Postsynthetic modification (PSM) is one of the most promising methodologies to enhance the gas adsorption capacities in MOFs [", "18", "]. One of the postsynthetic modification methods was incorporation of carbon nanotubes or activated carbon into the porous framework of MOFs which produces a composite hybrid material with enhanced sorption capacities because of the unusual mechanical and hydrophobic properties of carbon nanotubes [", "19", ", ", "20", ", ", "21", "]. Theoretical studies predicted that lithium ion doping was an effective method of increasing the hydrogen binding energy in MOFs and single walled carbon nanotubes which was useful in enhancing the hydrogen uptake capacities [", "22", ", ", "23", ", ", "24", "]. Simulation studies have shown that lithium doped single walled carbon nanotubes with two positive charges showed hydrogen binding energy of 0.26\u00a0eV, which is useful for hydrogen storage at room temperature [", "22", "]. Lithium ion was mostly used for doping because it can effectively donate electron density to the organic linkers of MOFs [", "23", "]. Lithium is also lightweight and can be relatively easily doped into MOF frameworks. Simulation studies have also shown that doped Li ions in MOF donates ~0.9 electron to the MOF linker and results in a H", "2", " binding energy of about 12\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol", "\u22121", " and strong binding to Li near MOF corners [", "24", "]. A new strategy of lithium doping by postsynthetic alkoxide formation inside hydroxyl group functionalised MOFs was developed by theoretical and experimental methods [", "25", ", ", "26", "]. Himsl et al. [", "27", "] have shown an improvement in low pressure hydrogen uptake capacity by lithium doping in hydroxy-modified MOFs. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation studies by Ghoufi et al. [", "28", "] in Li modified MIL-101 at 77\u00a0K have shown substantial increase in hydrogen storage capacities up to 10\u00a0wt%. Meng et al. [", "29", "] reported that lithium doped IRMOF-9 has shown hydrogen storage capacity of 4.04\u00a0wt% at 298\u00a0K and 100\u00a0bar by theoretical calculations. Simulation studies have also shown that lithium doped MOFs and COFs can store more than 6\u00a0wt% of hydrogen at ambient conditions [", "30", ", ", "31", "].", "MIL-101 is a chromium (III) terephthalate MOF material with a mesoporous zeotype architecture assembled by corner-sharing super tetrahedra, which consist of Cr", "3", "O trimers and 1, 4-benzenedicarboxylic acids [", "32", "]. It contains numerous unsaturated Cr metal sites, and two types of mesoporous cages (29 and 34\u00a0\u00c5 in diameter) with microporous windows (12 and 16\u00a0\u00c5 in diameter) [", "33", "]. MIL-101 has a giant cell volume, a very high surface area, large pores and high thermal and chemical stabilities which makes it an important candidate for diverse applications such as gas adsorption, separation and catalysis [", "34", "]. Hydrogen sorption capacity in MIL-101 was enhanced by the formation of composite material with single walled carbon nanotubes and activated carbon incorporated into the framework which tune the pore size and pore volume towards hydrogen sorption [", "20", ", ", "21", "]. The experimental Li doping studies in MIL-101 and Cu", "3", " (BTC)", "2", " increased their hydrogen sorption capacities by 43 and 46\u00a0% respectively at 77\u00a0K up to 1\u00a0bar pressure [", "35", "].

At 80\u00a0bar we got hydrogen uptake capacity of 0.45\u00a0wt% (4.50\u00a0mg\u00a0g", "\u22121", ") which is in very good agreement with the literature data of 0.43\u00a0wt% (4.30\u00a0mg\u00a0g", "\u22121", ") reported by Latroche et al. [", "41", "]. The SWNT-MIL-101 sample showed hydrogen uptake capacity of 6.19\u00a0mg\u00a0g", "\u22121", " which is also in good agreement with the previously reported data of 0.64\u00a0wt% (6.40\u00a0mg\u00a0g", "\u22121", ") up to 60\u00a0bar [", "20", "]. Simulation studies have shown that lithium doped MOF-C30 can reach gravimetric hydrogen uptake capacity of 51.6\u00a0mg\u00a0g", "\u22121", " (5.16\u00a0wt%) at 300\u00a0K and 100\u00a0bar pressure [", "30", "]. Theoretical calculations by Cao et al. [", "31", "] predicted that lithium doped COF-108 and COF-105 can have gravimetric hydrogen uptake capacities 68.4 and 67.3\u00a0mg\u00a0g", "\u22121", " (6.84 and 6.73\u00a0wt%) respectively at 298\u00a0K and 100\u00a0bar pressure. Finally the doping of single walled carbon nanotubes incorporated MIL-101 with a little amount of lithium (830\u00a0ppm) multiplies the hydrogen uptake capacity of the material by more than two times (4.96\u201310.43\u00a0mg\u00a0g", "\u22121", ") at 298\u00a0K and 90\u00a0bar pressure. Prasanth et al. [", "20", "] reported that single walled carbon nanotubes incorporation in MIL-101 leads to the formation of new ultramicropores of 6\u20137\u00a0\u00c5 which enhanced the room temperature hydrogen uptake capacity by better interaction between MOF surface and hydrogen molecules. Also theoretical and experimental studies have shown that lithium doping considerably enhanced the hydrogen uptake capacities in MOFs and COFs at ambient temperatures due to the strong affinity of lithium towards hydrogen molecule [", "23", ", ", "24", ", ", "25", ", ", "26", ", ", "27", ", ", "28", ", ", "29", ", ", "30", ", ", "31", "]. Therefore the enhanced hydrogen uptake capacity in SWNT-MIL-101 composite material at 298\u00a0K in the present study may be attributed to the combined effect of both the formation of ultramicropores by SWNT incorporation and by the strong interaction of doped Li inside the pores of MIL-101 towards hydrogen.", " ", "Open image in new window", " ", "Fig.\u00a06", " ", "Hydrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of ", "a", " MIL-101, ", "b", " Li@MIL-101, ", "c", " SWNT-MIL-101, ", "d", " Li@SWNT-MIL-101-A, ", "e", " Li@SWNT-MIL-101-B and ", "f", " Li@SWNT-MIL-101-C at 298\u00a0K up to 90\u00a0bar", " ", " ", "4 ", "Conclusions", "The modification of MIL-101 both by SWNT incorporation and lithium doping considerably enhanced the hydrogen uptake capacity of MIL-101. The doping of single walled carbon nanotubes incorporated MIL-101 with a little amount of lithium (830\u00a0ppm) multiplies the hydrogen uptake capacity of the material by more than two times (4.96\u201310.43\u00a0mg\u00a0g", "\u22121", ") at 298\u00a0K and 90\u00a0bar. However excessive lithium doping leads to loss of crystallinity and framework decomposition, so controlled doping of lithium and single walled carbon nanotubes are necessary to get good surface area values and thus high hydrogen uptake capacities. The combined modification in MOFs with SWNT incorporation and lithium doping and subsequent formation of a new hybrid composite has provided a new strategy for room temperature hydrogen uptake enhancement in MOFs.\n"], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO1\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig1_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig1_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO2\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig2_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig2_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO3\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig3_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig3_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO4\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig4_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig4_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO5\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig5_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig5_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO6\"> <a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig6_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10934-015-0047-1/MediaObjects/10934_2015_47_Fig6_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a> </div>"]}
