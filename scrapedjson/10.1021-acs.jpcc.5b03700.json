At the infinite dilution limit, a CO", "2", " molecule is only interacting with the framework atoms.

For the M-MOF-74 series, this interaction is associated with the coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms. The agreement that we obtain, between experiments and simulations, at low loading indicates that we are able to accurately describe these interactions. The fact that the predicted loadings are found to be systematically higher as the pressure increases could be attributed to multiple effects. The isotherms start deviating before the open metal sites are saturated, which indicates that this apparent overestimation is not due to inaccuracies in the treatment of the strongest binding sites but is due to the unavailability of these binding sites at a lower CO", "2", " loading. One possible explanation could be that not all the open metal sites are accessible to CO", "2", " molecules during the experimental measurements. This argument has also been made in other computational", "(17)", " and experimental", "(27)", " studies, but the nature of the inaccessibility remains unclear.", "Additional evidence pointing to pore inaccessibility can be deduced from the heats of adsorption. As can be seen from the data presented in Figure ", "6", ", the agreement between the experimental heats of adsorption and those predicted by the force fields developed here is better than the one found for the UFF. This observation is in accordance with the accurate description of the isotherms at low loading. For Mg-MOF-74, a MOF not examined in this work, a considerable drop in the experimental heat of adsorption with increased CO", "2", " loading was observed due to the large difference between the interaction strength with the metal site and with the organic part of the MOF.", "(17)", " For the four M-MOF-74 analogues considered here, a steep decrease in the heat of adsorption with increasing CO", "2", " loading is only observed for Ni-MOF-74. In contrast, the decrease is less pronounced for Co- and Mn-MOF-74. This behavior can be attributed to a smaller difference between the interaction strength of CO", "2", " with the metal sites and the secondary adsorption sites, and hence the two sites can be populated simultaneously. Within the pressure range of the reported isotherm for Cu-MOF-74, the open metal sites remain far from saturation and therefore the heat of adsorption as a function of loading remains flat. If we look at the loading where the heat of adsorption starts to decline, we can see that it occurs at \u223c0.7 CO", "2", "/Ni", "2+", ". If all sites were accessible, we would expect the decline to start after the saturation of the metal sites (1.0 CO", "2", "/Ni", "2+", ").

As expected, the effect of water on the accessible surface area and free volume was smaller than that of MeOH due to its smaller size. For example, reducing the free volume of Ni-MOF-74 by 80% requires 57% of the open metal sites to be occupied by MeOH molecules. In the case of water in Ni-MOF-74, the free volume is only reduced to \u224880% even at full occupancy of the open metal sites. Furthermore, we observed that the accessible specific surface area decreases only by about 6% for MeOH in Cu-MOF-74 and less than 3% for the other three MOFs when 30% of the open metal sites are occupied by solvent molecules. This surprisingly small effect is presumably due to a compensation between two effects: the surface area initially increases in absolute terms as the first few solvent molecules protrude into the pores while the additional mass of the solvent molecules reduces the per-gram surface area.

However, using the absolute error would result in predicted inaccessibility amounts that differ by less than 10%.", "We quantified the amount of MeOH required to be present in the pores in order to best reproduce the experimental results.

The computed isotherms for the optimal amount of MeOH in the pores are shown in Figure ", "8", ", demonstrating that MeOH residue could be a plausible explanation for these MOFs. Specifically, the observation that \u224825% of the open metal sites in Co-MOF-74 are not accessible agrees well with available neutron diffraction data which show a maximum occupancy of 0.73(2) for CO", "2", " in Co-MOF-74.", "(27)", " The occupancy of CO", "2", " was not determined for the other analogues examined in that work.", "The presence of water in the pores creates a more complicated situation with two competing effects acting at the same time. On one hand, the CO", "2", " interaction with the framework is enhanced by the presence of water in the pores that leads to an enhancement of the CO", "2", " uptake. On the other hand, the reduction of free volume tends to limit the uptake by reducing the density of highly favorable adsorption sites. In addition, since we are comparing to gravimetric measurements, the adsorption is further reduced due to the additional mass of the water molecules. For Ni-MOF-74, the MUPE can only be reduced down to 22%, for a water content of \u224823%, while the MUPE for the empty framework is 27% (see ", "Supporting Information", ", Figure S5, Table S4). For Mn-MOF-74 and Co-MOF-74 a large fraction of the metal sites needs to be occupied by water for the MUPE between the experimental and calculated data to be minimized, that is, \u224846% for the former case and \u224888% for the latter case (", "Supporting Information", ", Table S4). In both of these cases the minimum MUPEs achieved were larger than the equivalent residual MeOH loadings. Overall, the assumption that water is present in the pores does not appear to be a satisfactory explanation for any of the MOFs considered here.", "The available experimental isotherm for Cu-MOF-74 differs from the other isotherms as it remains linear within the pressure range that is reported. This means that the open metal sites do not become saturated, and therefore it is difficult to fully assess the extent of open metal site inaccessibility. Moreover, based on the computed binding energies, neither MeOH nor water molecules are expected to remain in the pores of Cu-MOF-74. The MeOH\u2013Cu", "2+", " interaction energy, calculated using PBE-D3, is \u221246.1 kJ/mol and the water\u2013Cu", "2+", " interaction energy is \u221239.0 kJ/mol (see ", "Supporting Information", ", Table S7), which are \u224830 kJ/mol smaller in magnitude than those for the other M-MOF-74 analogues and comparable to the strongest interaction of CO", "2", " in these MOFs. MeOH in the pores of Cu-MOF-74 was able to only reduce the MUPE from 27%, for the empty framework, to 20% when approximately 75% of the open metal sites were occupied, which is unlikely based on the relatively weak interaction of MeOH with the framework. In addition, at this MeOH content the CO", "2", " heat of adsorption is overestimated, resulting in a higher uptake at lower loadings (see ", "Supporting Information", ", Figure S14). Any water content in the pores of Cu-MOF-74 resulted in an increase of the uptake. This was because the CO", "2", "\u2013water interaction is considerably larger than the CO", "2", "\u2013Cu", "2+", " interaction.

Yu et al.", "(16)", " also reported high-pressure CO", "2", " adsorption isotherms up to 50 bar for Mn-, Co-, and Ni-MOF-74. When extending our computed isotherms using the optimum computed MeOH content and pore blocking, we found the agreement to extend up to the highest pressure range (see ", "Supporting Information", ", Figure S13).", "It is important to note that MeOH in the pores of Mn-, Co-, and Ni-MOF-74 leads to a better agreement with experiments than assuming pore blockage, with the minimum MUPEs being up to 4 times smaller (", "Supporting Information", ", Table S4). The reason for this is that the assumption of pore blockage leads to a uniform reduction of the isotherm. This is also the reason that it can be approximated by scaling the isotherm by a fixed amount. On the other hand, MeOH in the pores reduces the higher pressure loading without affecting the lower pressure uptake significantly and therefore a better agreement with experiments can be achieved for both pressure regimes. This effect can be seen in Figure ", "9", ", where we have plotted the adsorption isotherms normalized by the experimental values. We can see that both the pore blockage and MeOH residue scenarios lead to similar agreement with the experimental results for pressures over 0.1 bar. However, at lower pressures, pore blockage leads to a considerable and systematic underestimation of the experimental isotherms. The improved agreement with experimental results is also reflected in the heat of adsorption when computed for the fraction of residual MeOH molecules or pore blockage that best reproduces the experimental isotherms. The decline of the heat of adsorption with increased loading agrees better with experiments (see ", "Supporting Information", ", Figure S14).", "It is reasonable to assume that crystalline defects act together with residual solvent to limit the adsorption uptake in these MOFs. We computed the MUPEs, using the average of experimental isotherms,", "(16, 27)", " as a function of both pore blockage and metal sites being occupied by MeOH for Mn-, Co-, and Ni-MOF-74 (see ", "Supporting Information", ", Figures S10\u2013S12). We found that for all cases the deviation is minimized for the case of purely solvent induced inaccessibility. This is due to uniform reduction of the isotherm over the pressure range when pore blockage is assumed. However, there is a series of combinations that result in comparable MUPEs and the difference in the level of agreement obtained for each scenario is small relative to the uncertainty coming from our calculations and the experimental results. A small increase (\u22481 kJ/mol) in the CO", "2", " binding energy with the open metal sites obtained from the electronic structure calculations would significantly increase the loading in the Henry\u2019s law region and allow the pore blocking scenario to result in a better agreement with experiments than the residual MeOH scenario. In addition, the predicted residual MeOH content in each MOF is not in accordance with the relative interaction strength of MeOH with the MOFs (", "Supporting Information", ", Table S7). For example, at the PBE-D3 level, MeOH is computed to bind more weakly to Co-MOF-74 than to Ni-MOF-74 by about 8 kJ/mol, but comparable amounts of residual MeOH are proposed here for these MOFs. In conclusion, although it is clear from our analysis that a considerable number of the metal sites in all four MOFs are not accessible to adsorb CO", "2", ", we cannot ascertain which effect or combination of effects acting together is more plausible.", "Figure 9.

At higher loadings, however, a systematic overestimation of the experimental results is observed. We attribute this overestimation to the lack of accessibility of the open metal sites encountered in experimental measurements. In addition, we have used our derived force field to quantify the effect of metal site inaccessibility assuming two possible causes: residual solvent molecules and structural defects causing pore blockage. We used MeOH and water as potential residual solvent molecules based on their availability during synthesis as well as difference in size and interaction strength between these molecules and CO", "2", ". A MeOH content occupying about 25% of the open metal sites results in the best agreement between the computed and experimental adsorption isotherms for all the MOFs except Cu-MOF-74. On the other hand the majority of the open metal sites, and in some cases all the open metal sites, would need to be occupied with water in order to reproduce the experimental isotherms. This indicates that water is an unlikely source of pore inaccessibility in these MOFs. However, the intrusion of water either from incomplete activation or as trace impurity in the adsorbate feed has been suggested in order to explain measurements in cationic zeolites.", "(72)", " A pore blockage of roughly 20% for all four MOFs yields good agreement for pressures over 0.1 bar but also leads to a systematic underestimation of the loading at lower pressures. Thus, the overall deviations are higher than those achieved with MeOH molecules attached to the open metal sites. Finally, we have demonstrated that a combination of residual solvent molecules and crystalline defects present in the structures could also explain the lower CO", "2", " uptake observed in experiments.", "Our force field parametrization scheme requires a limited number of quantum chemistry calculations while maintaining a simple form for the potential functions and yields a force field that is able to capture the adsorption behavior in the four MOFs we examined, whereas generic force fields, like UFF, significantly underestimate the loading.

Recently, researchers have investigated collections of porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) with the intent of finding correlations between CO2 sepn. ability and various material properties.  However, due to the limited size of the collections, no clear correlations were found for material properties such as pore size, surface area, and pore vol., leaving researchers with little guidance in the design of new materials.  In this work we drastically expand the scope of previous studies to include over 130 000 hypothetical MOFs, using mol. simulation to generate the adsorption properties.  The resulting data exhibit sharply defined structure-property relationships that were not apparent when smaller collections of MOFs were considered.  We show clear correlations between purely structural characteristics (e.g., pore size, surface area, and pore vol.), as well as chem. characteristics (i.e., functional groups), with five adsorbent evaluation criteria taken from the engineering literature.

Kohn-Sham d. functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism.  The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coeffs. and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles.  The coeffs. for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations.  System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination nos. (CN).  They are used to interpolate between dispersion coeffs. of atoms in different chem. environments.  The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each d. functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of at. forces.  Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered.  The method has been assessed on std. benchmark sets for inter- and intramol. noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems.  The mean abs. deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 std. d. functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version.  Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems.  The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coeffs. also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface.  For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding.

For 12 different functionals, a std. \"zero-damping\" formula and rational damping to finite values for small interat. distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested.  The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coeffs. is used.  The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interat. forces at shorter distances.  With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramol. dispersion in four representative mol. structures are found.  For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermol. distances.  For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general.  The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of cor. GGAs for non-covalent interactions.  According to the thermodn. benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate esp. for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are obsd.  It seems to provide a phys. correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified std. functionals.

We then generate a benchmark binding curve using a coupled-cluster approach with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] at the complete basis set (CBS) limit.

We find that finite-basis MP2 significantly overbinds the complex.  On the other hand, even the simplest empirical correction to std. d. functionals is sufficient to bring the binding energies to well within 1 kJ/mol of the benchmark, corresponding to an error of less than 10%; PBE-D in particular performs well.

Predictions of the adsorption isotherm for n-perfluorohexane in BCR-704 using the latter force field parameters and the FAU-X structure with a water/calcium ratio of 1 yield good agreement with the exptl. benchmark data.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXht1KgsLvK&md5=e6fa5e20f28b903dc677fc69b0e8149c"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2015/jpccck.2015.119.issue-28/acs.jpcc.5b03700/20150710/images/small/jp-2015-03700z_0010.gif\">"]}
