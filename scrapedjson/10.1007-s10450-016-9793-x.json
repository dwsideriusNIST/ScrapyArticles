There are several technologies applied for the separation of mixtures of CH", "4", " and CO", "2", " (Singh et al. ", "2009", "; Scholes et al. ", "2012", "), in which adsorption-based processes are widely used for post-combustion CO", "2", " capture (Ebner and Ritter ", "2009", "), the purification of biogas (Alonso-Vicario et al. ", "2010", "), and the purification of coal mine methane and coal mine ventilation air (VAM) (Olajossy et al. ", "2003", "). The reason is that the separation cost is usually low if the separation is based on the difference of components in adsorption (Ruthven et al. ", "1994", "). Furthermore, the adsorbent is a decisive factor of feasibility and separation cost. In a cost-effective manner, zeolites are considered as potential sorbents for the adsorption of CH", "4", " and CO", "2", " gas mixtures (Ackley et al. ", "2003", "; Yang et al. ", "2012", "; Zhang et al. ", "2012", "; Mofarahi and Gholipour ", "2014", ").", "Zeolites have been intensively investigated in recent decades because of their large surface areas and molecular sized porous structures (Zhang et al. ", "2014", "; Dunne et al. ", "2009", "; Bakhtyari and Mofarahi ", "2014", "). They are an important class of materials in which separations are obtained by selecting the pore size such that in mixtures molecules that are too large are blocked (Smit and Maesen ", "2008", "). Therefore, zeolites are widely used in applications such as separation, purification, ion exchange, catalysis and the isolation of biological molecular (Krishna and van Baten ", "2005", "; Rouleau et al. ", "2009", "). Currently, about 200 types of zeolite have been crystallographically classified and several new types still appear every year (Liu et al. ", "2013", "). Thus, studies on the adsorption and separation behaviors for CH", "4", " and CO", "2", " mixtures in new zeolites are very important and attractive from the viewpoints of science and their applications.", "However, zeolites are also challenging because it is very difficult to carry out experiments that provide us with information at the molecular level. In this respect, molecular simulations nicely complement experiments (Catlow et al. ", "2004", "). With the development of computer technology, molecular simulation methods, such as Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), are playing an important role in developing our understanding of the relationship between the microscopic and macroscopic properties of molecular fluids confined in zeolites, and can be used to generate adsorption isotherms for gases on microporous solid adsorbents (Liu et al. ", "2011", "; Kim et al. ", "2013", "). To date, the adsorption of water/methanol and water/ethanol mixtures in zeolite 4A was simulated using the GCMC simulation (Wu et al. ", "2009", "). The Cosoli group (Cosoli et al. ", "2008b", ") studied H", "2", "S removal from biogas streams using different zeolites such as NaX, NaY, LTA and MFI with the GCMC method. Pham et al. (Pham et al. ", "2014", ") studied the adsorption of N", "2", " and CO", "2", " in pure silica zeolites (BEA, CHA, FER, MFI, and STT) experimentally and by GCMC simulation, and the agreement between computed adsorption isotherms and isosteric heats with those found experimentally was excellent. The Calero group investigated the adsorption selectivity of CO", "2", ", N", "2", " and CH", "4", " in MFI, MOR, ISV, ITE, CHA and DDR (Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. ", "2007", "). The results showed that the selectivity behavior strongly depended on the type of material structure and the bulk composition of the mixture. Therefore, molecular simulations have become a powerful tool to explore both materials science and life science fields (Zeng et al. ", "2007", "; Cosoli et al. ", "2008a", ").", "In this work, the adsorption and separation properties for CO", "2", " and CH", "4", ", and the selectivity performance of new siliceous zeolites (IFO, JSR, SEW and OKO) were investigated using the molecular simulation method, which would quickly aid in choosing effective adsorbents for gas adsorption and separation, and could be practically important for gas separation from low-concentration mine gas.", "2 ", "Computational methods", "2.1 ", "Zeolite structures", "New zeolites are discovered and synthesized annually. Their adsorption, separation and selectivity properties are worth investigating and can be a fascinating area of research.

The GCMC method uses a grand canonical ensemble, in which the chemical potential of each species, the volume of the system and the temperature are fixed (Agnihotri et al. ", "2008", "; Biswas and Cagin ", "2010", "). Hence, comparisons between simulation results and experimental data are reasonable because the adsorption conditions (pressure and temperature) are also constant in the experiments (Rahmati and Modarress ", "2013", "; Nugent et al.

All interactions of gas\u2013zeolite and gas\u2013gas were modeled using the PCFF force field (Hill and Sauer ", "1994", "; Sun ", "1995", "). The PCFF has been proved as a powerful force field supporting for adsorption in many zeolite systems (Song et al. ", "2002", "; Yang et al. ", "2008", "; Zhao et al. ", "2012", "). The cutoff distance for the calculation of the van der Waals potential energy by an atom based technique was taken as 1.3\u00a0nm. The partial charges of atoms were estimated by the charge-equilibration method (Rappe and Goddard ", "1991", ") and the electrostatic energy was calculated using the Ewald summation method (Karasawa and Goddard ", "1989", ") with an accuracy of 0.0001\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol", "\u22121", ". The partial pressure required for describing the chemical potential of the adsorbed molecules was calculated using the ideal gas law. In the GCMC simulation, adsorbate molecules in the zeolite were translated, rotated, created and deleted from the zeolite framework at random with a probability of 0.225, 0.225, 0.275 and 0.275, respectively (Rahmati and Modarress ", "2009", "; Rahmati et al.
