Recent developments in the synthesis of multiferroic materials from metalorgs. are reviewed.  Single-phase multiferroics have weak coupling among ferroic properties.  Heterostructures are more promising for device applications since the coupling in such structures is many orders of magnitude stronger.  These heterostructures also offer more degrees of freedom such as compn., microstructure and orientation for optimized coupling.  Two major deposition techniques are discussed: (i) metalorg. chem. vapor deposition (MOCVD), and (ii) chem. soln. deposition (CSD).  These techniques are versatile and economical for deposition of the mentioned structures.  In MOCVD the film growth is continuous, whereas, CSD is a multi-step process that involves coating using suitable precursor soln. followed by annealing in appropriate ambient, and the desired thickness is obtained by repeating these steps.  The desired properties of metalorg. precursors suitable for use in these techniques are outlined.  In the case of MOCVD, different precursor delivery methods for liq. and solid precursors are also presented as they are equally important.  Recent efforts on fabrication of single-phase multiferroics and improvements in properties of single-phase materials through doping/substitution using MOCVD and CSD are reviewed.

Upon immersion in the filtrate of 1a (namely 1a-s, freshly filtered) or 1b (namely 1b-s, filtered and then activated in air for three days), single crystal-to-single crystal (SCSC) transformations of 1a-1c to a new MOF, formulated as [Co6O2(OH)4(BTB)8/3(H2O)4]\u00b714DMF\u00b74EtOH\u00b72H2O (2), occur along with dramatic color change from blue purple to red.

ESI-MS studies unveil the formation of free {Co3O} units in situ formed only in 1a-s and 1b-s, and evidence that the SCSC transformation involves a postsynthetic uptake of free metal clusters, {Co3O}.  On the other hand, the SCSC transformation speed decreases from 1a to 1c, which is detd. by the chelate carboxylate groups undergoing cleavage of metal-carboxylate bonds during the SCSC transformation and the shape of the 1D channels affecting the diffusion of free metal clusters.  Furthermore, the resulting MOF (2) can maintain its crystallinity upon activation and adsorbs iodine up to 38 wt%.  Combined with the significant SCSC transformation through postsynthetic uptake of free metal clusters and the resulting MOF capable of adsorbing iodine, the present approach not only provides a true route to construct SBUs-based MOF materials with pre-existing \"real\" SBUs but also represent a new type of SCSC transformation in the field of MOFs that is able to efficiently tune structures and physicochem. properties of MOFs in the solid states.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtVehs7vO&md5=1b98ffef0768cdba92049797d0e75d5e", "14.

The trend of selectivities for M-MOF-74 materials is explained well by the binding strengths from 1st-principles calcns.  For all M-MOF-74 materials, the selectivity increases with increasing pressure due to the special structural properties of these MOFs: high densities of metal sites as well as optimal pore widths and vols.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38Xnt12hsA%253D%253D&md5=e539dd5baab9851a42c66a323ac7928c", "(b) ", "Bloch", ", ", "E.
