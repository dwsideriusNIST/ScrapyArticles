The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth of metal org. framework compds. (MOFs).  The defining character of these compds. is their porosity.  However, in many cases no effort was made to show evidence that a stable porous structure was achieved and that the pores may be accessed.  The authors describe recent work on porous pillared zirconium diphosphonates, and the newer and in many respects different characteristics of tin(iv) phosphonates.  The Sn(iv) monophosphonates form spherical globules that exhibit very high surface areas.  The surface area arises from their nano-sized particles that pack in a house of cards arrangement.  Also, the 1,4-monophenyldiphosphonic acid forms highly porous (250-400 m2 g-1) materials with Sn(iv) when prepd. in alc.-water media.  This is not the case with analogous Zr(iv) compds.  The many variations in the syntheses of both the zirconium and tin aryl- and alkyldiphosphonate pillars and their combinations with spacers such as Me- and monophenylphosphonic acid have created a variety of highly porous materials that are stable to 400\u00b0 in air, highly stable in acid media, do not collapse when de-solvated, and can be post and presynthesis altered to include functional groups.  Several new directions taken by other researchers are also described.  However, it is emphasized in this presentation that the cross-linked compds. form particles that ppt. rapidly into nanoparticles that exhibit only short range order.  Therefore, they differ from the more conventional MOFs in that they are not amenable to structure soln. by x-ray or neutron diffraction techniques.  Rather, they must be understood from modeling and indirect data from EM, NMR, and addnl. spectroscopic and textural studies.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhtlensr7P&md5=dc2d2170172dcf6aba6e8ca6aa1bf51c", "(b) ", "Ferey", ", ", "G.", " ", "Chem.

This crit. review will be of interest to the experts in porous solids (including catalysis), but also solid state chemists and physicists.  It presents the state-of-the-art on hybrid porous solids, their advantages, their new routes of synthesis, the structural concepts useful for their 'design', aiming at reaching very large pores.  Their dynamic properties and the possibility of predicting their structure are described.  The large tunability of the pore size leads to unprecedented properties and applications.

The fully dehydrated solid possesses permanent porosity with elliptical channels 8 \u00c5 \u00d7 9 \u00c5 in free diam.  The structural change results from the loss of H2O coordinated to the Ni cations, so that the Ni coordination changes from edge-sharing octahedral NiO5N to edge- and corner-sharing 5-fold NiO4N.  During this change, two out of three phosphonate groups rotate to become fully coordinated to Ni cations, leaving the remainder of the phosphonate groups coordinated to Ni cations by two O atoms and with a P=O bond projecting into the channels.  This transformation, which is completely reversible, causes substantial changes in both vibrational and electronic properties as shown by IR, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopies.  Complementary adsorption, calorimetric, and IR studies of the probe adsorbates H2, CO, and CO2 reveal several distinct adsorption sites in the solid, which are attributed to their interactions with Ni cations which are weak Lewis acid sites, as well as with P=O groups that project into the pores.

The crystal structures and luminescent properties of lanthanide phosphonates are reviewed.  The structural elucidation for lanthanide phosphonates is difficult due to its low soly. and poor crystallinity.  To overcome these problems, two types of synthetic techniques were applied: attaching various functional groups or introducing a second metal linker.  By attaching various types of functional groups to the phosphonate ligand, lanthanide phosphonates with 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D structures have been isolated.  Using the acidic metal linker such as oxalate usually leads to compds. with a complicated 3D network structure whereas a basic second metal linker such as phenanthroline helps the formation of compds. contg. the polynuclear clusters.  Phosphonic acids are versatile ligands that can adopt a no. of coordination modes depending on the cation size, temp. and the pH value of the reaction media.
