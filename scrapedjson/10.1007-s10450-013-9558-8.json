", "2009", "; Parilla ", "2012", "). In light of this inter-laboratory variation, it has been easy to dismiss reports of high uptake that are not easily substantiated elsewhere (Luzan and Talyzin ", "2010", "; Luzan and Talyzin ", "2011", "; Parilla ", "2012", "; Stadie et al. ", "2010", "), discounting potential effects of material synthesis (Stuckert et al. ", "2010", "; Li and Yang ", "2006", "). A recent example of this is a report of 4.4\u00a0wt% hydrogen uptake for a Pt-decorated nitrogen-doped graphene, (Parambhath et al. ", "2012", ") in which virtually no experimental details for measurement are given in the preceding cited paper (Parambhath et al. ", "2011", "). The majority of \u201cproblematic\u201d hydrogen storage measurements have been conducted on high pressure volumetric adsorption unit, otherwise known as a Sieverts apparatus (Sieverts ", "1908", "; Langmuir ", "1915", "; Brunauer et al. ", "1938", "). The operating principle of a conventional single-sided Sieverts apparatus is simple: to measure the pressure drop as gas contained in a manifold is expanded into a chamber that contains the adsorptive, after correcting for the pressure drop due to expansion (Webb and Orr et al. ", "1997", "; Lee et al. ", "2008", "; Lachawiec et al. ", "2008", "; Zhang et al. ", "2004", "; Blach and Gray ", "2007", "; Blackburn et al. ", "2008", "; Rouquerol et al. ", "1999", "). A differential unit consists of two mirror-image single-sided units connected via a differential pressure transducer, so that adsorption and blank experiments may be conducted simultaneously (Rouquerol et al. ", "1999", "; Zielinski et al. ", "2007", "; Qajar et al. ", "2012", "; Browning et al. ", "2002", "; Blackman et al. ", "2006", "). The accuracy of conventional (Lachawiec et al. ", "2008", "; Tibbetts and Meisner ", "2001", "; Broom and Moretto ", "2007", "; Belmabkhout et al. ", "2004", "; Gross et al. ", "2012", "; Kiyobayashi et al. ", "2002", "; Lee et al. ", "2008", "; Blach and Gray ", "2007", "; Zhang et al. ", "2004", ") and differential (Zielinski et al. ", "2007", "; Qajar et al. ", "2012", "; Browning et al. ", "2002", "; Blackman et al. ", "2006", ") units have been addressed previously, and yet, the inter-laboratory tests indicate error is still common (Zlotea et al. ", "2009", "; Parilla ", "2012", "). Although increasing the sample size can significantly increase the accuracy of the volumetric measurement, this is often not practical during the material development stage of specialty novel adsorbents. When sample size is limiting, common pitfalls include: (1) Uncertainties in volume calibration, exacerbated by the sensitivity of the pressure transducers; (2) Uncertainties in correcting for the volume occupied by the sample; (3) Possible adsorption of the \u201cinert\u201d gas during volume calibration; (4) Adsorption to system components and treatment of the \u2018null\u2019 correction; (5) Potential changes in sample mass during pretreatment, combined with restrictions of weighing scales to measure the mass of the sample in situ in the enclosed sample cell, (6) Temperature effects and gradients; and (7) Treatment of gas compressibility. Many of these features are exacerbated at high pressure, as discussed by Tibbetts et al. (Tibbetts and Meisner ", "2001", "). The differential unit has several advantages over the conventional unit. First, it incorporates a second pressure transducer, which can be matched to the pressure drop anticipated for adsorption rather than the total pressure of the measurement. This typically corresponds to a 10-fold decrease in scale for the differential pressure relative to the absolute pressure, and as the precision of the transducer is generally proportional to the scale of measurement, incorporation of a second differential transducer effectively incorporates a ~10-fold more sensitive measurement. Furthermore, a differential measurement reduces artifacts associated with temperature deviations and gas non-idealities (Zielinski et al. ", "2007", "; Browning et al. ", "2002", "; Blackman et al. ", "2006", "), as both compartments experience these effects equally.", "The overall goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the precision of a differential volumetric method can be significantly improved by proper choice of an operating equation to process the data, calibrate volume, handle volume asymmetries, and incorporate the null correction. As improvements offered by the differential method to handle temperature effects, temperature gradients, and gas non-idealities have been discussed extensively (Zielinski et al. ", "2007", "; Browning et al. ", "2002", "; Blackman et al. ", "2006", "; Qajar et al. ", "2012", "), our consideration is limited to isothermal measurements. Under these conditions, we will demonstrate that the added complexity of the differential unit (i.e. twice the number of volumes to calibrate, two pressure transducers) does not provide any real advantage in system accuracy relative to the conventional single-sided unit unless our improved operating equations are used. To support this claim, we provide both analytical error expressions and a rigorous numeric multivariate analysis. As prior error analysis of the volumetric method has considered only single-variate analysis (with few notable exceptions (Mohammad et al. ", "2009", "; Demirocak et al. ", "2013", ")), we reconsider many of the prior claims in how to increase the accuracy of a volumetric measurement. The error analysis is experimentally validated with ambient temperature H", "2", " adsorption to GX 31 superactivated carbon up to 80\u00a0bar.

Samples were weighed prior to loading to a sample cell and re-weighed at the conclusion of the adsorption experiment. Typically, at least 100\u00a0mg (\u00b10.1\u00a0mg) sample was used, unless otherwise specified.

After pretreatment, the sample cell is cooled, sealed under vacuum, and transferred to the adsorption unit. Dual valves (7 & 8 and 10 & 11, Fig.\u00a0", "1", ") are used to separate the sample [and ballast] volumes to allow for isolation of the system from air with sample loading and unloading, and in-line filters (0.5\u00a0\u03bcm) are located above the valves to prevent contamination.

A physical ballast is not added to the system, with asymmetries treated mathematically (see text)", " ", " ", "2.2 ", "Differential volumetric adsorption unit", "The custom built volumetric differential Sieverts apparatus (Fig.\u00a0", "1", ") utilizes an absolute pressure (", "P", ") transducer (PXM01-I, Omega) and a differential pressure (", "dP", ") transducer (PX77, Omega) to measure the pressure differential between adsorbing (\u2018A\u2019) and ballast (\u2018B\u2019) sides. The scale of the differential pressure unit is based on differential (rather than absolute) pressure, and is matched to the pressure drop expected for adsorption rather than the maximum pressure of the adsorption isotherm. All system components are made from \u00bc\u201d stainless steel tubing with compression fittings.

The two sides are ", "approximate", " mirror images, and as we believe it is impossible to exactly match the sample cell volume to the ballast volume without introducing a systematic error, asymmetries are handled mathematically, as described in the derivations below. Thus, no attempt is made to include a physical ballast to match adsorbate volume. In our system, total volume of one side, which is comprised of the charge, sample, and valve volumes (i.e. V", "AAS", "\u00a0=\u00a0V", "A", "\u00a0+\u00a0V", "AS", "\u00a0+\u00a0V", "V", "\u00a0~\u00a0V", "BBS", "\u00a0=\u00a0V", "B", "\u00a0+\u00a0V", "BS", "\u00a0+\u00a0V", "V", ") is ~42\u00a0cc. The physical volume ratio of the system, (V", "A", "/V", "AAS", "\u00a0~\u00a0V", "B", "/V", "BBS", "), is 37:42, i.e. 0.88. To calculate moles, reduced volumes are used such that effect of temperature and gas non-ideality may be incorporated (Sect. 1.1, Supporting Information). The volume ratio was set during design as follows: V", "AS", " was determined by the anticipated sample volume, while the size of V", "A", " was dictated by the use of \u00bc\u201d tubing to facilitate evacuation and avoid residual H", "2", ", the use of double isolation valves, safety valves, and the use of inline filters. These volumes are calibrated using the pressure expansion method, i.e. expanding the gas from a known or calibrated volume to the unknown volume, monitoring the pressure drop due to expansion, and then applying a mole balance to determine the unknown volume (See Sect. 1.2, Supporting Information). The reference calibration volume is 154\u00a0cc, and includes the manifold volume, V", "A", ", and V", "B", ". Although we explore the sensitivity of calibrated volume for various calibration procedures below (and in Sect. 1.3, Supporting Information), these values are from high pressure to vacuum, with the pressure difference prior to expansion between the two volumes being greater than 40\u00a0bar.

The scale of the differential transducer was chosen to be five-fold smaller than the absolute pressure transducer due to the anticipated adsorption amount (i.e. <~5\u00a0wt%). The absolute transducer is located in the manifold (region I, Fig.\u00a0", "1", ") to avoid introducing asymmetries in the adsorption region and to limit the number of transducers to two.

Initial experimental testing demonstrated this introduced negligible error, and is ultimately an issue incorporated into most volumetric units unless a ", "P", " transducer is located in each chamber. Others have utilized two absolute transducers in the charging volumes (Zielinski et al. ", "2007", "). The number of pressure transducers is a clear trade-off between simplicity, expense and accuracy.", "For an adsorption experiment, the sample is prepared and loaded, the sample and ballast cell volumes are isolated (valves 10 and 11 are closed), the manifold and charging volumes are pressurized, sealed, and then thermally equilibrated (pressure stability to \u00b10.1\u00a0bar within 10\u00a0min). The charging volumes are then isolated from the manifold (valves 5 and 6 are closed), and then isolated from each other (i.e. valve 9 is closed). After each valve closure, the system is stabilized for a few minutes. After closing valve 9, the initial reading on ", "dP", " is monitored to ensure it is within the sensitivity of the instrument (this serves as a leak check, as the transducer is highly sensitive to external leakage). To initiate adsorption, the initiation valves (10 and 11) are opened simultaneously to allow gas to enter the sample and ballast cells.

For multistep isotherms, the pressurization procedure is repeated without reducing the sample cell pressure.

The reasons for conducting the He blank at the same conditions as the primary adsorption experiment are discussed below (and also in Sect. 1.4, Supporting Information).", "The isolated absolute pressure transducer in the manifold is used to track bulk system temperature (assuming an appropriate gas law and a leak-free system, See Sect. 1.5, Supporting Information), and this is more sensitive than external Type K thermocouples (See Fig. S2). Currently, we provide for no external temperature control, allowing the system temperature to vary with room temperature, which typically varies by <0.5\u00a0\u00b0C over a 24-h period, and tends to be cyclic in nature with building start-up and shut-down.

The error in volume calibration is minimized when the reference volume is approximately equal to the sample cell volume (i.e. \u03b3\u00a0\u2192\u00a00.5, see also Fig. S1), and the volume ratio ultimately dictates Blach and Gray\u2019s figure of merit (Blach and Gray ", "2007", "), which is the pressure drop in a non-adsorbing expansion relative to the pressure drop when adsorption occurs, and should be maximized.", "So how precisely should system volumes be calibrated in order to perform a sufficiently accurate adsorption measurement? Although it is rare to find detailed information on volume calibration, similar studies show experimental volume calibration RSD to be on the order of 1.5\u00a0% of measurement (Checchetto et al.

Of course, our rule of thumb is based on Taylor expansion and is thus somewhat conservative.", "4.1.2 ", "Divergence in common practices", "Given this analysis, we revisit some previous suggestions on how to handle volume calibration. Gross et al. recommend the following procedure (Gross et al. ", "2012", "): fix the pressures in the known and unknown volumes at a fixed percentage of the full scale, allow sufficient time for thermal equilibration of gas; and alternate high pressures between the known and unknown volumes prior to expansion. Our analysis shows (see also Sect. 1.3 of the Supporting Information) volume calibration error is minimized when the percentages are fixed at 100\u00a0% (in the large volume) and 0\u00a0% (in the smaller volume). Other recommendations for accurate volume calibration include: (1) use of both high pressure (Tibbetts and Meisner ", " 2001", ") and low pressure He (Furukawa et al. ", "2007", "), (2) calibration at the regeneration temperature of adsorbent (Malbrunot et al. ", "1997", "), (3) careful choice of an equation of state (Zhou et al. ", "2007", "; Kiyobayashi et al.

Clearly, low pressure He leads to large error (Fig.\u00a0", "2", "), and it is unclear how an iterative procedure (Zhang et al.

Numeric analysis demonstrates similar trends utilizing the standard uncertainties (Table\u00a0", "3", "), considering less pronounced errors in volume (0.2\u20130.4\u00a0%) as well as errors in other independent variables.

A conservative variation in sample density (2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0g/cc) shows that error in sample density is not a large factor for the SD differential measurements. At first, this may seem at odds with prior reports claiming high sensitivity to sample density, in particular for highly porous materials with low skeletal density (Blach and Gray ", "2007", "; Gross et al.

However, it seems their analysis neglects the error associated with other variables, most notably, it neglects errors in volume calibration. As sample density is inversely related to sample volume, uncertainty in sample density corresponds to an uncertainty in volume. The conservative estimate of sample density uncertainty used (i.e. 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0g/cc) above leads to a volume uncertainty on the order of the volume calibration error. As Blach and Gray\u2019s analysis considers a conventional unit but ignores other potential volume errors; their effect is much larger than what we observe here.

All numeric error analysis above assume that the 100\u00a0mg of sample is known with 0.1\u00a0mg, which we feel reflects this methodology. Should this mass uncertainty be increased to 10\u00a0mg, the corresponding contribution of mass towards overall error increases from 1 to 10\u00a0%.

This is related to the ability of the equipment to precisely get to the target charging pressure. For multistep isotherms on the differential unit, one must consider this effect on both the differential pressure and cumulative differential pressure. A detailed analysis (Sect. 2.4 of Supporting Information) to consider this effect on a differential unit demonstrates this error is zero for random fluctuation (i.e. \u03b4 fluctuates about a set point) for perfectly symmetric systems. The error increases as asymmetry grows. For example, a ~5\u00a0% deviation from symmetry and a random fluctuation in pressure set point of 1\u00a0bar (i.e. \u22121\u00a0<\u00a0\u03b4\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0bar) will have a negligible effect on calculated adsorption (a fractional error of ~10", "\u22123", " for small systems and 10", "\u22124", " for larger systems). If the fluctuation is not random, but tends to deviate in a constant value above (or below) the set point, any pressure mismatch terms go to zero for a perfectly symmetric unit (See Sect. 2.4, Supporting Information). For non-random fluctuations with slightly asymmetric units, pressure deviations still tend to be dampened by ~1/50th to 1/100th due to pre-factors associated with pressure mismatch in the derivation. Considering the hypothetical material, the error that arises due to pressure mismatch is nearly 2\u00a0% for Method DM-BC and 3\u00a0% for Method DM-SD when \u03b4\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0bar (See Fig. S4a\u2013b).", "4.4 ", "Case studies and design guidelines", "In order to generalize the discussion to other unit designs, we now perform a series of Case studies using the hypothetical material.

This represents a potential systematic error in volume calibration. Differential Method D-V is 600-fold more sensitive to volume errors than differential Method D-BC, and asymmetric (i.e. one-sided) volume errors lead to similar error as conventional Method C-V: For example, a 0.1\u00a0cc perturbation in sample cell volume perturbs the isotherm by over 50\u00a0% for Method D-V compared to 0.1\u00a0% for Method D-BC (Fig.\u00a0", "6", "(i) and (ii)).

Although the conventional blank correction Methods (BC and M-BC) offer some advantage, the propagated error continues to exceed the measurement for multi-step isotherms. For example, a six-step isotherm to 80\u00a0bar processed with [the most common] Method CM-V has a propagated error of (~180\u00a0%), and Method CM-BC reduces this error to only 144\u00a0% (Fig.\u00a0", "8", "). A one-step measurement to 80\u00a0bar reduces error to 30\u00a0% for C-V and 24\u00a0% for C-BC. For small sample size (100\u00a0mg was chosen), a single step to maximum pressure effectively increases the signal due to adsorption.

Once the unit is built, the following additional factors influence the required sensitivity of the instrument (i.e. the minimum amount of moles adsorbed that need to be detected): (i) number of adsorption steps; (ii) sample mass; and (iii) adsorption temperature. Sample density may also influence the measurement, as highlighted by Blach and Gray (Blach and Gray ", "2007", ").", "As certain design decisions may be ultimately determined by budget, it is important to justify the added cost of purchasing two transducers and twice the system components. To provide a \u201ccost-benefit analysis\u201d, Fig.\u00a0", "9", " compares the accuracy of the differential to the conventional unit for various volumes and pressure transducers (see list in Methods). The differential is significantly more accurate than the conventional unit (Fig.\u00a0", "9", "), with the exception of when the full scale of the differential transducer is increased to that of the absolute transducer (see curve \u2018d\u2019, black circles in Fig.\u00a0", "9", "a and b; error has been reduced by a factor of 3 for curve \u2018d\u2019 to fit to scale), for reasons discussed above.

Minor changes in intermediate values of \u03b3 have little (<1\u00a0%) effect on the error. Sample density also does not affect the fractional error for practical system volumes. Thus, if budget is one\u2019s primary concern, one should build a differential unit with the most accurate differential transducer one can afford. To obtain comparable precision on a conventional unit, a much more precise absolute transducer (at least 10-fold increased accuracy) is required, and this is prior to considerations of pressure mismatch, valve volumes, temperature gradients, and gas compressibility. In both units, the best strategy is to minimize the volume so as to maximize measurement sensitivity while maintaining sufficient volume to ensure system evacuation. Although larger volumes decrease measurement sensitivity, the effect is dampened in the differential unit due to its increased sensitivity relative to the conventional unit.

Volume errors generally account for 40\u201350\u00a0% of the total error except when low density samples are used and volume errors are very small (~0.2\u00a0%).", "In contrast, numerical analysis shows the fractional error of differential Method DM-BC does not exceed 14\u00a0% for similar scenarios, with typical values being ~5\u00a0%. Use of the most accurate differential pressure transducer leads to fractional errors of less than 0.3\u00a0%. The differential unit is clearly able to accurately measure 100\u00a0mg of sample. The largest contributor to error is the differential pressure transducer, and the method is relatively insensitive to errors in volume or pressure mismatch. As in the case studies, errors in Method DM-SD are slightly higher, but less than 16\u00a0% in all scenarios. Method DM-BC significantly reduces error accumulation that occurs for multistep isotherms, as it tracks the cumulative differential pressure. Method CM-BC is also tabulated in Table S4b, but as this method is so sensitive to pressure mismatch, it is not considered further here.", "4.4.5 ", "Sample density (revisited)", "In the analysis in Sect. ", "4.2", " above for our specific system, the error in sample volume (i.e. inverse sample density) tended to be less than the error in the volume calibration, and thus, uncertainties in sample density had relatively little effect on \u2018SD\u2019 methods. Our general analysis illustrates this was due, in part, to the choice of a relatively large-volume differential unit. For small volume systems with a very high-accuracy pressure transducer, the opposite may be the case, as was the case considered by (Demirocak et al. ", "2013", ") for a conventional adsorption unit. The differential method that was most sensitive to sample density was Method DM-SD, and although the overall error of this method was much improved relative to the common differential methods (D-V, DM-V), uncertain sample density contributed a large portion of the overall error, with the effects most pronounced for low density and/or small volume systems (Sect. 8, Supporting Information). In general, this happens when the error in sample volume begins to exceed the error in volume calibration, with the latter ultimately determined by pressure transducer sensitivity and total volume. When errors in sample density (volume) begin to dominate over calibration error, increasing ", "dP", " transducer sensitivity will have little effect on the precision of the \u2018SD\u2019 methods (Table S6). In contrast, increased pressure transducer sensitivity does provide a significant increase in the precision of differential Method DM-BC (Table S5).", "4.4.6 ", "Valve volumes", "As a final consideration, we consider the effect of valve volume, which may lead to large errors in conventional units (Parilla ", "2012", "). Method C* was introduced to correct for this effect in conventional units. Regardless, valve volumes tend to be symmetric volume perturbations for the differential unit, and as shown in the preceding section (Fig.\u00a0", "6", "), differential methods are relatively insensitive to [small] symmetric volume perturbations (see Fig.\u00a0", "11", "). The effect of valve volume (or any asymmetric volume error) increases as the valve volume to total volume ratio increases. Thus, small differential units are somewhat susceptible to error when valve volume is neglected. For example, volume ratio (\u0393", "A", ") of 12:5 and a V", "V", " of 0.5\u00a0cc positively skews the differential Method DM-V isotherm by +25\u00a0% at 80\u00a0bar while a V", "V", " of 3\u00a0cc skews the isotherm by +120\u00a0% (Fig.\u00a0", "11", "a). Method DM-BC is negatively skewed by 18\u00a0% for a 3\u00a0cc V", "V,", " offering a significant improvement relative to Method DM-V (Fig.\u00a0", "11", "b). Results for DM-SD are similar (data not shown), and the findings are consistent with analytical treatment (Table S3). Like absolute volume uncertainty, one-step differential isotherms are less sensitive to valve volume than multi-step isotherms (Sect. 6, Supporting Information). Conventional units are much more sensitive: A 0.1\u00a0cc V", "V", " with Method C* has a comparable effect as a 3\u00a0cc V", "V", " in Method V (Fig.\u00a0", "12", " inset) even though it is an improvement over Method C-V, but the differential units offer greater improvement. Interestingly, Method C* is not as accurate as Method CM-BC, and Method CM-BC is relatively insensitive to valve volume (showing magnitudes similar to Method DM-BC). Blank corrections offset the potential error in valve volumes, as both the blank and the adsorption experiment are affected in equal ways. Although Method CM-BC is insensitive to valve volume and more accurate than Method C*, it is highly sensitive to pressure mismatch, as discussed above.", " ", "Open image in new window", " ", "Fig.\u00a011", " ", "Effect of valve volume for ", "a", " Method DM-V, with a \u0393", "A", "\u00a0=\u00a05:12 (valve volume numbers next to isotherm), and ", "b", " Method DM-BC for a 3\u00a0cc valve volume and \u0393", "A", "\u00a0=\u00a05:37 (", "blue", "), 5:25 (", "purple", ") and 5:12 (", "green", ").

For example, on a conventional unit, it has been claimed that 2\u00a0mg sample can be measured within 0.15\u00a0% (i.e. 0.0015 mmols) at 40\u00a0bar (Lee et al. ", "2008", ") with a transducer sensitivity of 0.3\u00a0% of the reading. However, our numeric analysis of CM-BC (Table S4b) for a 10\u00a0cc volume (similar to that in reference) shows this is not achievable for the transducer used in this report, and is impossible even when the transducer precision is improved 12-fold, to 0.025\u00a0% FS. Consideration of valve volumes will further worsen the accuracy. It is also worth noting that the uptake data presented by the authors showed a dependence on sample size, which was not accounted for by the error bars shown (Fig.\u00a0", "3", "b of published work), and is a clear indication of a problem in their measurements and/or estimation of the measurement error.", "Using a differential unit, Snape et al. (Blackman et al. ", "2006", ") were able to reproduce multiple intermediate-pressure adsorption isotherms to metal hydride samples within 0.05\u00a0wt%. However, to obtain similar precision for carbon-based samples, gram sized quantities were required. When 100\u00a0mg of a ballast sample was used, 2\u00a0wt% adsorption was obtained (and we presume) used for baseline subtraction. Although their differential transducer is two-fold more accurate than the one used here, the ~10-fold decrease in sensitivity seems attributable to a Method-V like operating equation, a high total volume (V", "A", ":V", "AS", "\u00a0=\u00a0168:17), and/or a high volume ratio (\u03b3\u00a0=\u00a00.91). Browning et al. claim much better sensitivity on a differential unit, reproducing hydrogen measurements within 0.1\u00a0wt% for 100\u00a0mg samples (Browning et al. ", "2002", "). Unfortunately, few system details are given, and although a null correction and low-pressure hydride validation are performed, the accuracy of the measurement at high pressure was not verified. Recently, a detailed error analysis of the differential unit claimed that sample and reference volumes have a significant effect on differential measurements (Qajar et al. ", "2012", "). However, this work relied on a volume-based operating equation (similar to Method D-V), and three volumes and an absolute pressure can be found in their operating equation. As Qajar et al. consider only an operating equation analogous to Method D-V, our findings are quite different. Theoretically, using Eq.\u00a0", "22", ", our system predicts 8\u00a0% error, which is a close match with our experimentally observed 7\u00a0%, and consistent with the fact Eq.\u00a0", "22", " is meant to be conservative. Had we used the more accurate P2 and dP2, the error could have been reduced to 1.2\u00a0%. Interestingly, Qajar et al. claim a 6\u00a0% error using the more accurate P2 and dP2; using these system parameters, Eq.\u00a0", "22", " predicts an error of\u00a0<1\u00a0%, suggesting a 8-fold potential for improvement had a BC or SD type method been used on the system rather than a volume-based operating equation. Although they use more sensitive transducers, Eq.\u00a0", "22", " suggests that their actual error is greater than 6\u00a0% due to the number of isotherm steps and the corresponding significant reduction in dN", "ads", ". Relative to Snape et al.\u2019s report, Eq.\u00a0", "22", " shows that a BC like method can achieve ~2-fold improvement (\u00b10.02\u00a0wt% vs. \u00b10.05\u00a0wt%), the relative increase in accuracy being small because of their large \u03b3 (See Fig.\u00a0", "10", "b). With this side-by-side analysis, it appears that the choice of operating equation may significantly reduce the contribution of volume to the overall measurement error, and we have reduced the sensitivity of the final adsorbed amount from being primarily attributable to volume uncertainties to being attributed to uncertainties in the differential pressure reading.", "4.5 ", "Generalizations and recommended procedures", "In designing a new volumetric unit, we have mathematically proven a differential unit has several advantages over a conventional unit. Focusing on our specific experimental design (with the transducer accuracies and total volumes outlined above), multivariate error analysis demonstrates Method DM-SD has an error of 20\u00a0% (1\u00a0wt%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0wt%) (Fig.\u00a0", "8", "), which represents an 90\u00a0% and 88\u00a0% ", "reduction", " relative to conventional multistep Methods CM-V and CM-BC, respectively. The error for DM-SD can be reduced further by using a more accurate differential pressure transducer, reducing number of isotherm steps and increasing sample mass. Based on the multistep, multivariate analysis, when the most precise pressure transducers are used, the differential method (DM-BC) offers a 250-fold improvement over the standard conventional measurement (CM-V); when the least precise transducers are used, the improvement is 13-fold. Use of the least precise transducers on a differential design still offers a 3-fold improvement relative to the most accurate transducers on a conventional design, as the conventional unit is much more sensitive to small errors in volumes, particularly when total system volume is small. These numbers would increase if temperature gradients, gas compressibility, valve volumes, and pressure mismatch were considered. As less accurate (and less expensive) pressure transducers on the differential unit lead to improved accuracy over the conventional unit, the purchase of a second transducer is warranted.", "On existing units, conducting a \u2018blank correction\u2019 measurement at the conditions of adsorption measurement (i.e. BC or SD type methods) significantly decreases sensitivity to volume errors, and this is an easy methodology to implement on existing units without a major equipment overhaul. As explained above, our specific recommendation is to conduct the blank measurement into an empty cell (SD methods) and correct for sample density, as this has similar precision while minimizing potential systematic errors.", "For existing conventional units, Method C-BC always has less random error than C-V, but unfortunately, Method C-V seems to be more commonly used and Fig.\u00a0", "8", " demonstrates why so many high-pressure conventional volumetric methods have led to unreliable results. Conventional Method CM-BC is capable of achieving similar accuracy as Method DM-BC when the absolute pressure uncertainty is decreased 5-fold. However, Method CM-BC is highly sensitive to pressure mismatch, and charge pressures must be matched almost exactly to avoid systematic error.", "The message is that the most accurate volume calibration is performed at the conditions of the adsorption experiment, and the most accurate isotherm will be achieved when the advice presented above for volume calibration is followed to set up the isotherm (i.e. single step from vacuum, maximum \u0394", "P", " ", " ", "o", " ", ", \u03b3\u00a0~\u00a00.5). In both conventional and differential measurements, increased accuracy is obtained when the number of steps is reduced, as this maximizes the adsorption signal. For example, a one-step measurement to 80\u00a0bar reduces the error by ~80\u00a0% for all methods (Fig.\u00a0", "8", ").", "5 ", "Summary and conclusions", "Volumetric adsorption measurements are highly prone to error due to uncertainties in volume calibrations. The most precise volume calibration is performed from a large calibration volume to vacuum with a high initial pressure differential between the two chambers. Even when a highly precise pressure transducer is used to calibrate volume, systematic errors in volume calibration are common. Volume calibration error can be minimized by using a large charge pressure differential, with high pressure in the largest volume and small pressure in the small volume. Designs that minimize sensitivity to volume uncertainties are required.", "We have developed two improved operating equations for differential volumetric methods that are virtually insensitive to volume uncertainties. The improved differential methods have a ~300-fold decrease in sensitivity to volume uncertainties relative to other differential methods, and represent an easily implemented change on existing equipment without physical overhaul of the equipment. The basic premise of these methods is that the differential pressure transducer is used to calibrate volume asymmetries at the conditions of the adsorption measurement. Without this improved methodology, differential units provide no real improvement for isothermal measurements relative to a conventional unit, although they may better handle gas non-idealities and temperature gradients. Hydrogen adsorption at 298\u00a0K on a super-activated carbon is measured within \u00b10.05\u00a0wt% for a 100\u00a0mg sample, even with a volume calibration that is within only ~1\u00a0%.", "Considering both a conventional and differential unit, we present a generalized design framework for a volumetric apparatus, varying the precision of the pressure transducer(s), the type of sample (i.e. its density), the system volume, and the volume ratio to demonstrate how these factors dictate the ultimate precision of the measurement. For virtually any system design, the improved differential method offers at least a ~10-fold increase (up to 250-fold with a precise differential pressure transducer) in precision relative to the conventional volumetric measurement; the improvement would be further enhanced if gas compressibility and temperature fluctuations were considered."], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\"
