CMOFs 1-5 were synthesized by directly incorporating three different chiral Mn-Salen struts into the frameworks under solvothermal conditions, and they were characterized by a variety of methods, including single-crystal x-ray diffraction, PXRD, TGA, and 1H NMR.  Although the CMOFs 1 vs. 2 and CMOFs 3 vs. 4 pairs were constructed from the same building blocks, they exhibit two-fold interpenetrated or noninterpenetrated structures, resp., depending on the steric sizes of the solvents that were used to grow the MOF crystals.  For CMOF-5, only a 3-fold interpenetrated structure was obtained due to the extreme length of the Mn-Salen-derived dicarboxylate strut.  The open channel and pore sizes of the CMOF series vary systematically, owing to the tunable dicarboxylate struts and controllable interpenetration patterns.  CMOFs 1-5 are highly effective catalysts for asym. epoxidn. of a variety of unfunctionalized olefins with up to 92% ee.  The rates of epoxidn. reactions strongly depend on the CMOF open channel sizes, and the catalytic activities of CMOFs 2 and 4 approach that of a homogeneous control catalyst.  Probably although the diffusion of bulky alkene and oxidant reagents can be a rate-limiting factor in MOF-catalyzed asym. reactions, the catalytic activity of the CMOFs with large open channels (such as CMOFs 2 and 4 in the present study) is limited by the intrinsic reactivity of the catalytic mol. building blocks.

In recent studies it is reported that covalent functionalization of the org. linker can influence or even integrate framework flexibility (breathing) in MOFs.  However, rational fine-tuning of such responsive properties is very desirable but challenging as well.  Here the authors present a powerful approach for the targeted manipulation of responsiveness and framework flexibility of an important family of pillared-layered MOFs based on the parent structure [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n (bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).  A library of functionalized bdc-type linkers (fu-bdc), which bear addnl. dangling side groups at different positions of the benzene core (alkoxy groups of varying chain length with diverse functionalities and polarity), was generated.  Synthesis of [Zn2(fu-bdc)2(dabco)]n yields the resp. collection of highly responsive MOFs.  The parent MOF is only weakly flexible; however, the substituted frameworks of [Zn2(fu-bdc)2(dabco)]n contract drastically upon guest removal and expand again upon adsorption of DMF, EtOH, or CO2, etc., while N2 is hardly adsorbed and does not open the narrow-pored form.  These breathing dynamics are attributed to the dangling side chains that act as immobilized guests, which interact with mobile guest mols. as well as with themselves and with the framework backbone.  The structural details of the guest-free, contracted form and the gas sorption behavior (phase transition pressure, hysteresis loop) are highly dependent on the nature of the substituent at the linker and can therefore be adjusted using the authors' approach.  Combining the authors' library of functionalized linkers with the concept of mixed-component MOFs (solid solns.) offers very rich addnl. dimensions of tailoring the structural dynamics and responsiveness.  Implementation of two differently functionalized linkers in varying ratios yields multicomponent single-phased [Zn2(fu-bdc')2x(fu-bdc'')2-2x(dabco)]n MOFs (0 < x < 1) of increased inherent complexity, which feature a nonlinear dependence of their gas sorption properties on the applied ratio of components.  Hence, the responsive behavior of such pillared-layered MOFs can be extensively tuned via an intelligent combination of functionalized linkers.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XmvV2gu7g%253D&md5=77c6f577d9bbe291f8f0acc44f27de76", "(b) ", "Wang", ", ", "X.-Y.", "; ", "Wang", ", ", "Z.-M.", "; ", "Gao", ", ", "S.", " ", "Chem.

Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.  Furthermore, gas sepns. in MOFs, including the mol. sieving effect, kinetic sepn., the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 sepn., and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXkvVamurY%253D&md5=cbb650af8ce92526fc8ffd870218bbd0"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-10/cg500975j/20140925/images/small/cg-2014-00975j_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-10/cg500975j/20140925/images/small/cg-2014-00975j_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-10/cg500975j/20140925/images/small/cg-2014-00975j_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-10/cg500975j/20140925/images/small/cg-2014-00975j_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-10/cg500975j/20140925/images/small/cg-2014-00975j_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-10/cg500975j/20140925/images/small/cg-2014-00975j_0004.gif\">"]}
