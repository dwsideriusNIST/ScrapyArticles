MOFs with their inorganic connecting units (based on a transition metal complex or cluster) and the manifold of organic linker molecules are promising materials with uniform and monodisperse pore sizes in the nanometer region. A linker and a connector are both designed to assemble three-dimensional (3D) open frameworks. Dicarboxylate organic linkers form rigid metal carboxylate clusters that act as secondary building units in the extended solid. The way of connection between the building blocks in an MOF is as important as the molecular units themselves.", "2,7,8", " ", " ", "For a given topology of a connector, for example, an octahedral Zn", "4", "O(CO", "2", ")", "6", " cluster, one can obtain an isoreticular series of MOFs. Such materials with zinc carboxylate clusters have been successfully synthesized by Eddaoudi et al. using a strategy based on reticulating metal ions and organic carboxylate linkers into extended periodic structures. They have obtained 16 different metal-organic frameworks, so-called isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs). Novel strategies of synthesis allow a systematic variation of the pore size using different organic linkers without changing the cubic topology of the whole framework. The framework topologies can be predicted by consideration of the geometry and conformational informations of secondary building units.

An extensive body of research results currently exists from the synthesis of metalorg. frameworks (MOFs), an area that has attracted widespread attention due to the facility with which well-defined mol. building blocks can be assembled into periodic frameworks and the promise that such a process holds for the logical design of materials.  The synthesis of MOFs generally involves the copolymn. of org. links and metal ions in a polar solvent under mild temps. (up to 200\u00b0) and autogenous pressures (up to 100 atm).  Since most products can be considered kinetically driven and lie on local thermodn. min., factors such as soly. of the org. link and metal salt, solvent polarity, ionic strength of the medium, temp. and pressure play crit. roles in detg. the character of products.  Indeed, slight perturbations in synthetic parameters were the basis for the prepn. of what seems to be a flood of new MOF compds.  In the spirit of this discussion the authors advance the following ideas and developments that the authors believe contribute to the maturity of the field: (I) a conceptual framework that unifies the processes involved in the designed synthesis of MOFs, and which can be extended to other materials with extended structures; (II) a thesis concerning the possible structures that may form from building blocks with various shapes; (III) important considerations for achieving the design and synthesis of frameworks in which it is possible to change chem. functionality and metrics without changing the underlying framework topol.; (IV) the inevitability of porosity for designed structures and some factors affecting framework stability; (V) insights on catenation:interpenetration vs. interweaving, forbidden catenation, and duals.
