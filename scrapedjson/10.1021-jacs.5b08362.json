First, the existence of the high-density ZIF-7(np) phase was confirmed by minimization of the structure. Second, the transition was modeled by performing NpT simulations at 50 K starting with the ZIF-7(lp) structure. Within just a few tens of picoseconds, the system transformed into a higher-density structure reminiscent of ZIF-7(np) (", "Figures ", "10", " and ", "S19", ").", "Next, we modeled the entire temperature-scan process. To mimic the experiment, we started with the simulated ZIF-7(np) structure and carried out a temperature scan in which we increased the temperature from 10 to 1100 K and back in 4 K increments and equilibrated the system at each temperature for 1 ps. With increasing temperature, the density decreased and exhibited steplike changes corresponding to the formation of more open structures and, eventually, the ZIF-7(lp)-like phase with rhombohedral symmetry at \u223c600 K. On cooling, there was a corresponding step change to a ZIF-7(np)-like structure. The slight hysteresis loop was also evident (", "Figure ", "11", "). The calculations were carried out with different sizes of the unit cell (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1, 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3, and 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4) and different equilibration intervals at each temperature; however, the corresponding features of the transition and transition temperatures remained very similar.", "Figure 10.

For the current force field model of ZIF-7, we selected three representative ZIF-7 polymorphs (", "Figure S20 and Table S5", "). Each of these structures has been minimized while fixing the unit cell parameters to the average values obtained from NpT simulations. The difference between the three different ZIF-7 phases is largely in the N\u2013Zn\u2013N angle, which is flexible in the current force field. The phase obtained at the high temperature of 840 K is similar to that of rhombohedral ZIF-7(lp). The phase obtained at 300 K is reminiscent of the ZIF-7(np) phase. Finally, the ZIF-7 phase obtained by minimization corresponds to the 0 K structure. The calculated enthalpy difference between the predicted ZIF-7(lp) and ZIF-7(np) structures is 6.1 kJ/(mol Zn), which is in remarkably good agreement with the experimental measurements (", "Table S5", "). Although the detailed structural parameters of the predicted ZIF-7 phases are only in qualitative agreement with the XRD measurements, the densities are in good agreement with XRD data (", "Figure ", "11", "). We have not attempted to refine the force field further.", "An important question is what drives the transition between different polymorphs of ZIF-7. According to the force field model, the stability of the different polymorphs of ZIF-7 can be viewed as a competition between strong nonbonded interactions (van der Waals and electrostatic), which favor formation of higher density structures at low temperatures, and the bonded interactions (mainly torsional and bending), which are essentially harmonic and favor formation of high-symmetry, lower density structures at high temperature. This is in agreement with what is known about other porous structures, for instance zeolites, where maximum volume structures are almost always in the maximum symmetry state.", "(33)", "Thus, the modeling suggests that formation of ZIF-7(np) is a combination of favorable nonbonded interactions that allow the structure to \u201cfold\u201d into a high-density, low-symmetry state. In comparison, ZIF-8, which has a similar SOD-like structure but with much smaller imidazolate linkers, does not exhibit the same type of transition. Finally, the fact that we found from computations several different ZIF-7(np) structures suggests potential ambiguity and difficulties in solving the ZIF-7(np) structure on the basis of XRD data.", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Results and Discussion", "Conclusions", "References", "Conclusions", "We have found that the 3D ZIF-7 framework exhibits complex behavior in response to the adsorption of guest molecules and changes in temperature, arising from the existence of different polymorphs and different types of adsorption sites.

By using a combination of XRD, high-resolution adsorption microcalorimetry, and molecular simulations, we were able to discriminate between these mechanisms and, by using osmotic subensemble theory, predict a phase diagram of CO", "2", " in ZIF-7 over a range of temperatures and pressures.", "We discovered that ZIF-7 undergoes a displacive phase change to a large pore, open porous structure upon heating to high temperatures, just prior to the onset of thermal decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of such a transition in a 3D ZIF framework.

Thermodynamics explains the occurrence of the high-temperature phase change for ZIF-7 and highlights the general features of the polymorphic phase transitions in ZIFs and other structures at high temperatures. Specifically, the phase with a smaller pore volume and lower symmetry is more favorable at low temperatures, and because the temperature increases, the phase with a larger, more accessible pore volume and a higher symmetry becomes more favorable.", "The high temperature at which the phase transition to ZIF-7(lp) occurs is quite exceptional. It is not completely clear why the onset temperature for the transition from np to lp phase upon heating is seemingly associated with the onset of thermal decomposition. We speculate that beyond being pure coincidence it could be a kinetic transformation into a thermodynamically more favorable structure in the absence of any significant guest\u2013host interactions at high temperatures. We remark that the transition in ZIF-7 from a narrow pore to a more open pore structure upon heating seems to be in contrast to what was reported for ZIF-4 which upon heating converted to an amorphous and then an even more dense crystalline phase via a reconstructive transition.", "(15)", "The predicted phase diagram of CO", "2", " in ZIF-7 exhibits quite complex re-entrant behavior with two critical points.

The existence of the low-temperature critical point has not yet been confirmed experimentally. We predict that the pore volume of the ZIF-7(np) phase may be a critical parameter that determines the existence of the low temperature critical point.", "The thermodynamic picture of the entropically driven phase change to a higher symmetry structure has been fully supported by our NpT molecular dynamics simulations, which reproduced semiquantitatively the changes in the ZIF-7 structure as a function of temperature. The calculated enthalpy difference between the ZIF-7(lp) and ZIF-7(np) phases was in good agreement with adsorption microcalorimetry and Clapeyron analysis of CO", "2", " experimental adsorption data. Moreover, this enthalpy difference is in agreement with the difference in enthalpies of formation between dense and wide-open ZIF materials, as measured by Hughes et al.", "(27)", " Thus, the thermodynamic arguments and simulations clearly suggest that ZIF-7(np) is a more dense phase than ZIF-7(lp). This is in agreement with a general observation that maximum volume structures are almost always in the maximum symmetry state.", "(33)", "The transition is driven by strong interactions between the benzimidazole linkers of ZIF-7, which can \u201cfold\u201d the structure into a more dense state. This type of transition is not observed for other ZIFs that contain smaller linkers, e.g., ZIF-8.

Herein the authors present the 1st high-pressure study on a porous ZIF, ZIF-8 (Zn(MeIM)2, MelM = 2-methylimidazolate) with a sodalite zeolite-type structure and a large accessible pore vol. (greater than 2000 \u00c53 per unit cell).  In summary, by applying pressure to ZIF-8 the hydrostatic medium can be forced to enter the pore, initially increasing the vol. of both the nanopore and the unit cell.  On increasing pressure further, more solvent can be forced into the nanopore, even though the nanopore vol. decreases, until the sample undergoes a phase transition.  This transition not only allows more solvent to enter the original nanopore, but it increases the size of the narrow channels that connect these pores, resulting in an overall increase in porous vol. and amt. of sequestered solvent.  Modification of the pore vol., size, shape, and therefore selectivity has thus been achieved on application of pressure.

At a high loading (\u223c50 N2mols. per unit cell), ZIF-8 shifts from low-loading (LL) to high-loading (HL) structure.  A stepped sorption isotherm is predicted with 3 distinct regions, which agrees well with exptl. data.  The orientation of imidazolate rings and the motion of framework atoms exhibit sharp changes upon structural transition.  Also, pronounced changes are obsd. in various contributions to potential energies (including stretching, bending, torsional, van der Waals, and Coulombic).  The anal. of radial distribution functions between N2 and framework atoms suggests N2 interacts strongly with the imidazolate rings in ZIF-8.  The simulation reveals that the structural transition of ZIF-8 is largely related to the reorientation of imidazolate rings, as attributed to the enhanced van der Waals interaction between N2 and imidazolate rings as well as the reduced torsional interaction of framework in the HL structure.  This is the 1st mol. simulation study to describe the continuous structural transition of ZIF-8 and, it provides microscopic insight into the underlying mechanism.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXivVyitb4%253D&md5=b21abf89d8caf67720104c9f908bf0fd", "(c) ", "Ortiz", ", ", "A.

The corner linkages between tetrahedra are hard-sphere oxygen atoms, which are presumed to act as freely-rotating, force-free, spherical joints.  All other inter-tetrahedral forces, such as coulomb interactions, are ignored.  Thus, the flexibility window represents the null-space of the kinematic matrix that governs the allowable internal motions of the ideal zeolite framework.
