In this regard metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising methane storage materials due to their high capacities and tunable properties. Within this class, HKUST-1 ([Cu", "(BTC)", "]", ", BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) is an important benchmark, as it exhibits methane densities that are among the highest reported. Furthermore, uptake in HKUST-1 can potentially be tuned by altering the methane\u2013MOF interaction through metal substitution on coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS). Predicting the impact of metal substitution remains a challenge, however, because general interatomic potentials commonly used in calculating uptake do not properly describe interactions involving CUS. Here, a new interatomic potential that explicitly accounts for these interactions is derived from quantum-mechanical calculations. The potential reproduces both the measured methane isotherm for HKUST-1 and the site preference for adsorption at CUS. Extension to 17 metal-substituted variants confirms that CUS composition can dramatically alter uptake, with Ni- and Ca-based compounds predicted to exceed the performance of Cu-HKUST-1.

That the potential remains nonzero well removed from the CUS (i.e., near the center of the pore) is not a flaw, but rather is a consequence of two factors: (i) All fitting calculations were performed using the periodic unit cell, and not with a (finite) cluster model of the MOF.

Toward this goal, new interatomic potentials describing CH", "4", " adsorption across the M-HKUST-1 series of MOFs were developed. These potentials were used to systematically explore the impact of metal-site composition on methane storage capacity, and to screen for new compositions that could outperform Cu-HKUST-1. The potentials explicitly account for interactions between methane and coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. This interaction is poorly described by existing general potentials, leading to incorrect predictions of negligible adsorption at these sites, and underprediction of uptake. The new potential assumes a simple Morse form, and is constructed by fitting to van der Waals informed density functional calculations (vdW-DF2 functional). Our prior studies revealed that this functional yields accurate energies for methane adsorption in CUS-containing MOFs. Testing on the benchmark Cu-HKUST-1 system revealed that the tuned potential yields a methane uptake isotherm in excellent agreement with recent experimental measurements, and correctly identifies CUS as a preferred adsorption site.", "The new potentials were subsequently applied to screen 17 additional compositions within the M-HKUST-1 series, where M = Be, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sc, Sn, Sr, Ti, V, W, and Zn. The results confirm that metal substitution can dramatically alter methane storage density; more importantly, they suggest that compositions with M = Ca and Ni should exceed the performance of Cu-HKUST-1 under usable operating conditions. These compositions are suggested as targets for experimental synthesis and characterization. Finally, methane uptake across the M-HKUST-1 series was observed to correlate well at low pressures with both the surface area and the partial charge (and therefore with the electronegativity) of the metal.

This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.  Furthermore, gas sepns. in MOFs, including the mol. sieving effect, kinetic sepn., the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 sepn., and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXkvVamurY%253D&md5=cbb650af8ce92526fc8ffd870218bbd0", "14.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.  Hence, one of the important challenges going forward is to find ways to pack MOFs efficiently without serious damage or to synthesize MOFs that can withstand substantial mech. pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtV2msbrN&md5=23f9bfad78f204569f0bf7c902d42dca", "21.

Methane adsorption enthalpies (\u0394H) on the benchmark Mg- and Ni-DOBDC systems were calcd. using several vdW-DFT methods.  The vdW-DF2 scheme was found to yield the best agreement with expts., with a mean abs. deviation (MAD) of 2.7 kJ/mol.  Applying this functional across the entire M-DOBDC series, it is obsd. that \u0394H varies from -16 to -34 kJ/mol.  These enthalpies are 10-20 kJ/mol less exothermic than that for CO2 adsorption in M-DOBDC, consistent with a weaker, dispersion-based CH4-MOF interaction.  In parallel with these thermodn. analyses, methane adsorption isotherms for five benchmark M-DOBDC MOFs were evaluated using several established interat. potentials.  An uncharged, single-site model for CH4 yielded the best agreement with expts., with a MAD of 16 cm3/cm3.  This potential was subsequently employed to predict methane capacities across the remainder of the M-DOBDC series, with addnl. comparisons to other prominent MOFs such as MOF-5, PCN-11, PCN-14, and HKUST-1.  Finally, the amt. of usable stored methane was examd. for two operating scenarios: isothermal pressure swing (PS) and a combined temp./pressure swing (TPS).  Under these conditions, PCN-11 and Be-DOBDC yield the best combination of gravimetric and volumetric methane densities at pressures below \u223c50 bar, while MOF-5 is best at higher pressures.

The efforts focused on how both geometric and chem. properties, such as void fraction (Vf), volumetric surface area (Sv), and heat of adsorption (Qst), impact methane deliverable capacity, i.e., the amt. of methane adsorbed at some storage pressure minus the amt. adsorbed at the delivery pressure.  With the aid of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, the authors studied methane adsorption and delivery properties in a population of 122,835 hypothetical pcu metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) and 39 idealized C-based porous materials.  From the simulation results, the authors developed an anal. equation that helped one delimit the necessary material properties to reach specific methane deliverable capacity targets.  The max. deliverable capacity between 65 and 5.8 bar among the hypothetical MOFs was 206 cm3(STP)/cm3 at 298 K.  Artificially increasing the methane-MOF interaction strength by increasing the Lennard-Jones \u03b5 parameters of the MOF atoms by 2- and 4-fold only improved the max. deliverable capacity up to 223 and 228 cm3(STP)/cm3, resp.  However, the effect on the amt. stored at 65 bar was more significant, which suggested another strategy; raising the temp. of the system by 100 K can recover \u223c70% of the methane stranded at the delivery pressure.  By increasing the delivery temp. to 398 K, the ARPA-E target was reached by a few hypothetical MOFs with quadrupled \u03b5 values.  This work shows the difficulty in reaching the ARPA-E target but also suggests that a strategy that combines a material with a large volumetric d. of sites that interact strongly with methane and raising the delivery temp. can greatly improve the performance of nanoporous materials for methane storage and delivery.  The optimal heat of adsorption in an isothermal storage and delivery scenario is \u223c10.5-14.5 kJ/mol, whereas in the nonisothermal storage and delivery scenario the optimal heats of adsorption fell within a range of 11.8-19.8 kJ/mol.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXktlentbg%253D&md5=f3aa5d0ec08105ec631fd6dcd5cc8e30", "37.

Successful implementation of mol. simulations requires accurate force fields (FFs) to describe the interactions of guest mols. with porous frameworks.  However, developing accurate and transferable FFs for porous materials can be extremely challenging.  While generic FFs and exptl.-derived FFs work well for many simple systems, they often fail to describe interactions in more complex porous materials.  Since first-principles quantum mech. (QM) approaches are capable of accurately predicting intermol. interactions, deriving FFs from QM data without exptl. input is a promising soln.  In this paper, we review recent developments in deriving first-principles FFs for mols. in a variety of nanoporous materials.  We summarize and classify the methodologies used in these studies, and discuss the factors that are responsible for the accuracy and reliability of FFs.

(HKUST-1, PCN-11, and PCN-14) the CH4 storage capacities of which are among the highest reported so far among all porous materials.  The three MOFs consist of the same dicopper paddle-wheel secondary building units, but contain different org. linkers, leading to cagelike pores with various sizes and geometries.  From neutron powder diffraction expts. and accurate data anal., assisted by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and DFT calcns., we unambiguously revealed the exact locations of the stored methane mols. in these MOF materials.  We found that methane uptake takes place primarily at two types of strong adsorption site: (1) the open Cu coordination sites, which exhibit enhanced Coulomb attraction toward methane, and (2) the van der Waals potential pocket sites, in which the total dispersive interactions are enhanced due to the mol. being in contact with multiple \"surfaces.\".  Interestingly, the enhanced van der Waals sites are present exclusively in small cages and at the windows to these cages, whereas large cages with relatively flat pore surfaces bind very little methane.  Our results suggest that further, rational development of new MOF compds. for methane storage applications should focus on enriching open metal sites, increasing the vol. percentage of accessible small cages and channels, and minimizing the fraction of large pores.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXltlWgtb0%253D&md5=8f6059d2e137ca23fb5eeb17d127be74", "42.

On the other hand, since MOF-5 is typically obtained as a bulk powder, it exhibits a low volumetric d. and poor thermal cond.-both of which are undesirable characteristics for a hydrogen storage material.  Here we explore the extent to which powder densification can overcome these deficiencies, as well as characterize the impact of densification on crystallinity, pore vol., surface area, and crush strength.  MOF-5 powder was processed into cylindrical tablets with densities up to 1.6 g/cm3 by mech. compaction.

Higher densities result in larger redns. in gravimetric excess.  Total pore vol. and surface area decrease commensurately with the gravimetric capacity, and are linked to an incipient amorphization transformation.

In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its abs. values, as it is currently done with mol.

For the periodic calcn. of isolated mols., the REPEAT charges are found to be in good agreement with those detd. with established mol. ESP charge derivation methods.  For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional mol. ESP approaches generate 'unphys.' charges, whereas the REPEAT method produces charges that are both chem. intuitive and consistent between different periodic electronic structure packages.  The new approach is employed to generate partial at. charges of various microporous materials and compared to both exptl. derived and mol. fragment ESP charges.
