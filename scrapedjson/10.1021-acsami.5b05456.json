Gating is a cooperative phenomenon involving a solid-state phase transformation from a nonporous to a porous phase of the adsorbent, and all unit cells switch simultaneously. Most frequently, the phase transition is triggered by adsorption or desorption of guest molecules and characterized by an activation energy barrier for the transformation, causing a hysteresis in the adsorption isotherm. Due to their capability to undergo stimulated structural transformations, soft porous crystals are often discussed as materials with huge application potential in gas separation processes, sensor technology, and catalysis. In particular, the high selectivity toward adsorptives stimulating the phase transition may be considered as a unique feature of switchable MOFs vs established adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbons resulting in high adsorption selectivities.

How does the mechanical stress influence the crystallite size, textural properties, and chracteristic quantities of the switching phenomenon (gate opening pressure, hysteresis) during cycling adsorption experiments?", "With these questions in mind four representative flexible MOFs, namely, MIL-53(Al), DUT-8(Ni), ELM-11, and SNU-9, showing different types of switching mechanism were chosen for investigations. All of these MOFs belong to either  breathing (MIL-53(Al), two transitions, lp\u2013np\u2013lp) or  gate pressure MOFs (DUT-8(Ni) and ELM-11, one transition, cp\u2013lp), associated with the displacement of framework atoms and a change in the unit cell volume. The selection involves 2D (ELM-11) and 3D frameworks (MIL-53(Al), DUT-8(Ni), SNU-9), whereas SNU-9 is a double-interpenetrated framework.

As a result, the crystallite size (domain size) changes during adsorption cycling, and the original crystals fragment into smaller domains adjusting to a finite value that can tolerate the adsorption stress. This leads to a less steep gate-opening slope and consequently broadening of the hysteresis loop. After preconditioning in the first cycles, the MOFs show stable adsorption/desorption behavior. An interesting observation is the pronounced shift of the gate pressure toward higher values after cycling.

Advances in flexible and functional metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), also called soft porous crystals, are reviewed by covering the literature of the five years period 2009-2013 with ref. to the early pertinent work since the late 1990s.  Flexible MOFs combine the cryst. order of the underlying coordination network with cooperative structural transformability.  These materials can respond to phys. and chem. stimuli of various kinds in a tunable fashion by mol. design, which does not exist for other known solid-state materials.  Among the fascinating properties are so-called breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host-guest interactions.  Phase transitions are triggered by guest adsorption/desorption, photochem., thermal, and mech. stimuli.  Other important flexible properties of MOFs, such as linker rotation and sub-net sliding, which are not necessarily accompanied by crystallog. phase transitions, are briefly mentioned as well.  Emphasis is given on reviewing the recent progress in application of in situ characterization techniques and the results of theor. approaches to characterize and understand the breathing mechanisms and phase transitions.  The flexible MOF systems, which are discussed, are categorized by the type of metal-nodes involved and how their coordination chem. with the linker mols. controls the framework dynamics.  Aspects of tailoring the flexible and responsive properties by the mixed component solid-soln. concept are included, and as well examples of possible applications of flexible metal-org. frameworks for sepn., catalysis, sensing, and biomedicine.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXht1Slu7nI&md5=b824d2bff6379c9662b50e86739b42f7", "2.

The field of host-guest complexation is intensely attractive from diverse perspectives, including materials science, chem. and biol.  The uptake and encapsulation of guest species by host frameworks are being investigated for a wide variety of purposes, including sepn. and storage using zeolites, and recognition and sensing by enzymes in soln.  Here we focus on the concept of the cooperative integration of 'softness' and 'regularity'.  Recent developments on porous coordination polymers (or metal-org. frameworks) have provided the inherent properties that combine these features.  Such soft porous crystals exhibit dynamic frameworks that are able to respond to external stimuli such as light, elec. fields or the presence of particular species, but they are also cryst. and can change their channels reversibly while retaining high regularity.

In this work, MIL-53(Al) tablets (Basolite A100) provided by BASF are evaluated to carry out CO2/CH4 sepn. by adsorption.  The adsorption capacity of CO2 and CH4 was assessed by dynamic expts. in a fixed-bed reactor, carried out at 303 K and pressures up to 3.5 bar.  The evaluated material presents an adsorption capacity of 4.3 mol kg-1 at 3.5 bar for CO2.  Fixed-bed expts. adsorption and desorption in helium flow revealed high selectivity of MIL-53(Al) material for CO2, with a sepn. factor of 4.1 at 303 K and pressures of 0.1-3.5 bar, thus showing to be promising for a PSA process.  The measured single and binary breakthrough curves were simulated with a math. model for fixed bed column.  Two VSA cycles, both with 4-steps but with different pressurization types were designed to produce 96.5% CH4 from a 40:60 CO2/CH4 mixt.; exptl. validation confirms a good model prediction.  Two industrial-scale PSA processes were designed and optimized by simulations, a case similar to natural gas upgrade (but lower inlet pressure) and biogas upgrade.

The MOF loading was varied in the range of 8-25 wt.%, while membranes with different thicknesses were obtained by two casting methodologies.  The synthesized membranes were tested in the sepn. of CO2 from an equimolar CO2/CH4 mixt.  At steady operation (T = 35 \u00b0C, \u0394P = 3 bar), incorporation of the MOF filler has a pos. effect on the sepn. performance which consists of a moderate enhancement of the sepn. selectivity, in certain cases along with an improvement in CO2 permeability.  In general, higher sepn. factors and CO2 permeabilities are achieved with PI than with PSF.  Our study reveals the relevance of the membrane thickness for both the sepn. performance under given conditions and the sensitivity to other structural and operational variables.  The incorporation of NH2-MIL-53(Al) as filler in PI-based MMMs has a larger effect, particularly a beneficial increment in CO2 permeability at const. sepn. factor, for thinner membranes casted in a Doctor Blade system.  This is tentatively attributed to the partial preservation of the original narrow pore configuration of this flexible MOF, unlike in thicker membranes casted in the absence of shear forces.  Although improvements in the sepn. performance remain moderate with respect to the neat PI counterpart, the benefits of the incorporation of MOF as filler become more apparent at high pressures: while for pure polymeric membranes a decrease in the sepn. factor is obsd. at increasing \u0394P, MMMs maintain large sepn. factors up to transmembrane pressures as high as 12 bar, highlighting the application potential of these composites.  On the other hand, reducing the membrane thickness limits the MOF loading that can be incorporated before the mech. stability of the membrane becomes compromised.  It also enlarges the impact of the temp. and trans-membrane pressure on the sepn. performance.

TDCs and AHPs are based on the evapn. and consecutive adsorption of coolant liqs., preferably H2O, under specific conditions.

While traditional type-I isotherms are obsd. for short alkanes (n = 1, 2), adsorbates with longer chains induce clear substeps in the isotherm curves whose positions depend on the chain length.  Such substeps are due to a breathing phenomenon, as proven by ex situ x-ray diffraction anal.

The loading dependence of the self-diffusivity shows peculiarities, including (i) a relatively rapid decrease of Ds at low loading for ethane and propane, and (ii) an unusual increase of Ds for n-butane at high loading, following a decreasing profile up to intermediate loading.  These diffusion behaviors are analyzed in light of the structural flexibility of the solids upon alkane adsorption characterized by the neutron measurements.  A 1D-type diffusion is evidenced for all alkanes with a jump sequence mainly ruled by the hydroxyl groups present at the surface of the MOF pore wall.  This global translational motion is assocd. with a rotational dynamics that differs according to the nature of the alkane: whereas n-butane follows uniaxial displacements, ethane shows random rotational reorientation.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXps1Srur4%253D&md5=d93acbdd60c0a1b6477f478ce2ee465b", "31.

This technique measures the time-resolved temp. change of an adsorbent during adsorption of a test gas.  Six carbide and carbon materials with well-defined nanopore architecture including micro- and/or mesopores are characterized by thermal response measurements based on n-butane and carbon dioxide as the test gases.  With this tool, the pore systems of the model materials can be clearly distinguished and accurately analyzed.  The obtained calorimetric data are correlated with the adsorption/desorption isotherms of the materials.  The pore structures can be estd. from a single expt. due to different adsorption enthalpies/temp. increases in micro- and mesopores.  Adsorption/desorption cycling of n-butane at 298 K/1 bar with increasing desorption time allows to det. the pore structure of the materials in more detail due to different equilibration times.  Adsorption of the org. test gas at selected relative pressures reveals specific contributions of particular pore systems to the increase of the temp. of the samples and different adsorption mechanisms.  The use of carbon dioxide as the test gas at 298 K/1 bar provides detailed insights into the ultramicropore structure of the materials because under these conditions the adsorption of this test gas is very sensitive to the presence of pores smaller than 0.7 nm.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2MXksVOktbk%253D&md5=b6f80651e256add18b2f70b7f92d1b2e", "32.
