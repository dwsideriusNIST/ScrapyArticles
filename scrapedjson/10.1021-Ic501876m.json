This highly constricted mode of guest access explains the slow kinetics shown by the lack of equilibration after many hours (", "Table S5", "). Given this diffusion path, we would expect a strong influence of particle size on adsorption kinetics, and this may explain some of the sample dependence.

This decreased selectivity suggests a decreased interaction of the guests with the framework and anion charge, but this could also be explained by adsorption kinetics given the diffusion limited nature of these materials.

This review focuses on the fabrication of continuous, thin porous films, either supported on solid substrates or as free-standing membranes.  The availability of such two-dimensional types of porous coatings opened the door for a no. of new perspectives for functionalizing surfaces.  Also for the porous materials themselves, the availability of a solid support to which the MOF-films are rigidly (in a mech. sense) anchored provides access to applications not available for the typical MOF powders with particle sizes of a few \u03bcm.  The authors will also address some of the potential and applications of thin films in different fields like luminescence, QCM-based sensors, optoelectronics, gas sepn. and catalysis.  A sep. chapter was devoted to the delamination of MOF thin films and discusses the potential to use them as free-standing membranes or as nanocontainers.  The review also demonstrates the possibility of using MOF thin films as model systems for detailed studies on MOF-related phenomena, e.g. adsorption and diffusion of small mols. into MOFs as well as the formation mechanism of MOFs (101 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXptFSrsw%253D%253D&md5=f0cfc5747b35e6a9477e04afd1d3381f", "8.

Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.

When stabilizing the alternate spin state of the host at any given temp., these processes directly stimulate the spin-crossover process, providing a chemi-sensing function.  Exploitation of the bistability of the host allows the modification of adsorption properties at a fixed temp. through control of the host spin state, with each state shown to display differing chem. affinities to guest sorption.  Guest desorption then adsorption, and vice versa, can be used to switch between spin states in the bistable temp. region, adding a guest-dependent memory effect to this system.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXosl2rsLs%253D&md5=062de2324bd4ada67c55972053ec1bb5", "37.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) -highly cryst. hybrid materials that combine metal ions with rigid org. ligands- have emerged as an important class of porous materials.  The org. ligands add flexibility and diversity to the chem. structures and functions of these materials.  In this Account, we summarize our lab.'s experience in tuning the topol. and functionality of MOFs by ligand design.  These investigations have led to new materials with interesting properties.  By using a ligand that can adopt different symmetry conformations through free internal bond rotation, we have obtained two MOFs that are supramol. stereoisomers of each other at different reaction temps.  In another case, where the dimerized ligands function as a D3-Piedfort unit spacer, we achieve chiral (10,3)-a networks.  In the design of MOF-based materials for hydrogen and methane storage, we focused on increasing the gas affinity of frameworks by using ligands with different geometries to control the pore size and effectively introduce unsatd. metal centers (UMCs) into the framework.  Framework interpenetration in PCN-6 (PCN stands for porous coordination network) can lead to higher hydrogen uptake.  Because of the proper alignment of the UMCs, PCN-12 holds the record for uptake of hydrogen at 77 K/760 Torr.  In the case of methane storage, PCN-14 with anthracene-derived ligand achieves breakthrough storage capacity, at a level 28% higher than the U.S. Department of Energy target.  Selective gas adsorption requires a pore size comparable to that of the target gas mols.; therefore, we use bulky ligands and network interpenetration to reduce the pore size.  In addn., with the help of an amphiphilic ligand, we were able to use temp. to continuously change pore size in a 2D layer MOF.  Adding charge to an org. ligand can also stabilize frameworks.  By ionizing the amine group within mesoMOF-1, the resulting electronic repulsion keeps the network from collapsing, giving rise to the first case of mesoporous MOF that demonstrates the type IV isotherm.  We use dendritic hexacarboxylate ligands to synthesize an isoreticular series of MOFs with (3,24)-connected network topol.  The cuboctahedral cages serve as building blocks that narrow the opening of the mesocavities into microwindows and stabilize these MOFs.  The resulting materials have exceptionally high surface areas and hydrogen uptake capacities.  Despite the many achievements in MOF development, there is still ample opportunity for further exploration.  We will be continuing our efforts and look forward to contributing to this blossoming field in the next decade.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhsV2ksbfO&md5=f17f81d99259e7ee659b30bcc2ddeea2", "44.

X-ray crystal structures of [CuII(pypzca)2]\u00b7H2O, [CoII(pypzca)2], [CoIII(pypzca)2]BF4, [CuII(pypzca)(H2O)2]BF4\u00b7H2O and [MnII(pypzca)Cl2]HNEt3 show that each of the (pypzca)- ligands binds in a meridional fashion via the N3 donors.  In the first three complexes, two such ligands are bound such that the spare pyrazine N atoms are positioned approx. orthogonally to one another and also to the imide O atoms.  In MeCN, the [MII/III(pypzca)2]0/+ complexes, where M = Ni, Co or Fe, exhibit one reversible metal based MII/III process and two distinct, quasi-reversible ligand based redn. processes, the latter also obsd. for MII = Zn.  [MnII(pypzca)Cl2]HNEt3 displays a quasi-reversible oxidn. process in MeCN, along with several irreversible processes.  Both Cu(II) complexes show only irreversible processes.  Variable temp. magnetic measurements show that [FeIII(pypzca)2]ClO4 undergoes a gradual spin crossover from partially high spin at 298 K (3.00 \u03bcB) to fully low spin at 2 K (1.96 \u03bcB), and that [CoII(pypzca)2] remains high spin from 298 to 4 K All of the complexes are weakly colored, other than [FeII(pypzca)2] which is dark purple and absorbs strongly in the visible region.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XlvVamtw%253D%253D&md5=166753560216d864ae7cda74d1cb61bb"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2014/inocaj.2014.53.issue-22/ic501876m/20141111/images/small/ic-2014-01876m_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2014/inocaj.2014.53.issue-22/ic501876m/20141111/images/small/ic-2014-01876m_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2014/inocaj.2014.53.issue-22/ic501876m/20141111/images/small/ic-2014-01876m_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2014/inocaj.2014.53.issue-22/ic501876m/20141111/images/small/ic-2014-01876m_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2014/inocaj.2014.53.issue-22/ic501876m/20141111/images/small/ic-2014-01876m_0005.gif\">"]}
