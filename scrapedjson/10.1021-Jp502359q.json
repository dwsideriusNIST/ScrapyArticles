Our efforts focused on how both geometric and chemical properties, such as void fraction (", "), volumetric surface area (", "), and heat of adsorption (", "), impact methane deliverable capacity, i.e., the amount of methane adsorbed at some storage pressure minus the amount adsorbed at the delivery pressure. With the aid of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, we studied methane adsorption and delivery properties in a population of 122\u2009835 hypothetical pcu metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) and 39 idealized carbon-based porous materials.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.  Hence, one of the important challenges going forward is to find ways to pack MOFs efficiently without serious damage or to synthesize MOFs that can withstand substantial mech. pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtV2msbrN&md5=23f9bfad78f204569f0bf7c902d42dca", "11.

In this work, mol. simulations are used to provide guidelines for the design of MOFs for hydrogen storage.

We also review the distinction between excess and abs. adsorption and show that comparing the d. of hydrogen within the free vol. of materials provides useful insight.

The model considered here can be viewed as the limiting case of the model by Gauden et al. (2010).  As an addnl. constraint, the authors impose a condition that the platelets in the packing must form a percolated self-supporting network, or cluster.  Two platelets belong to the same cluster if any two atoms of the platelets touch each other or slightly overlap.  Whether the platelets form a percolated cluster based on this criterion is detd. using the computational tools described in previous publication (Sarkisov L. and Harrison A., 2011).  Accessible surface area for this model of activated C averaged over several realizations of percolated cluster is 6403.0\u00b1204.9 m2/g.  The theor. possible accessible surface area of a model activated C substantially exceeds the current record values (BET surface area 3800 m2/g).  This work suggests that these values of surface areas in disordered C materials are not impossible after all.

The results provide concrete objective criteria to guide the search for the \"Holy Grail\" adsorbent, for which the adsorptive delivery is maximized.  It is shown that, for ambient temp. storage of hydrogen and delivery between 30 and 1.5 bar pressure, for the optimum adsorbent the adsorption enthalpy change is 15.1 kJ/mol.  For carbons, for which the av. enthalpy change is typically 5.8 kJ/mol, an optimum operating temp. of about 115 K is predicted.  For methane, an optimum enthalpy change of 18.8 kJ/mol is found, with the optimum temp. for carbons being 254 K.  It is also demonstrated that for max. delivery of the gas the optimum adsorbent must be homogeneous, and that introduction of heterogeneity, such as by ball milling, irradn., and other means, can only provide small increases in physisorption-related delivery for hydrogen.  For methane, heterogeneity is always detrimental, at any value of av. adsorption enthalpy change.  These results are confirmed with the help of exptl. data from the literature, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations conducted here using slit pore models of activated carbons as well as atomistic models of carbon nanotubes.

Here, in the context of methane storage, the first large-scale, quant. structure-property relationship (QSPR) anal. of MOFs is reported.  The effect is investigated of geometrical features, such as pore size and void fraction, on the simulated methane storage capacities of \u223c130 000 hypothetical MOFs at 1, 35, and 100 bar at 298 K.  From these data models are developed that can predict methane storage with high accuracy, based only on knowledge of the geometric features.  Several models were developed: multilinear regression (MLR) models, decision trees (DTs), and nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs).  In each case, 10 000 MOF structures were used to \"train\" the QSPR regression models, and the accuracy of the predictions was evaluated on a test set of \u223c120 000 MOFs.  The nonlinear SVM models can predict the methane storage capacity of MOFs in the test set with R2 values of 0.82 and 0.93 at 35 and 100 bar, resp.  Decision tree models produced rules for optimal design: for methane storage at 35 bar, MOFs should have densities greater than 0.43 g/cm3 and void fractions greater than 0.52; for methane storage at 100 bar, MOFs should have densities greater than 0.33 g/cm3 and void fractions greater than 0.62.

Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) predictions of gas adsorption of MOFs.  A total of \u223c58,000 hypothetical MOF structures were used to calibrate correlation models of the methane, N2, and CO2 uptake capacities from grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations.  The principal component anal. (PCA) transform of the AP-RDF descriptors exhibited good discrimination of MOF inorg. structural building units (SBUs), geometrical properties, and more surprisingly gas uptake capacities.  While the simulated uptake capacities correlated poorly to the void fraction, surface area, and pore size, the newly introduced AP-RDF scores yielded outstanding QSPR predictions for an external test set of \u223c25,000 MOFs with R2 values in the range from 0.70 to 0.82.  The accuracy of the predictions decreased at low pressures, mainly for MOFs with V2O2 or Zr6O8 inorg. SBUs and org. SBUs with fluorine substituents.  The QSPR models can serve as efficient filtering tools to detecting promising high-performing candidates at the early stage of virtual high-throughput screening of novel porous materials.
