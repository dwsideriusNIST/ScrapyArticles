The shape of the adsorption curves is driven by the alkyl chain length of the n-alkanes.  While traditional type-I isotherms are obsd. for short alkanes (n = 1, 2), adsorbates with longer chains induce clear substeps in the isotherm curves whose positions depend on the chain length.  Such substeps are due to a breathing phenomenon, as proven by ex situ x-ray diffraction anal.  They strongly depend on the amt. of adsorbate in the pores and on the nature of the metal (Al, Cr), which, for a given alkane, leads to a strong change in the substep positions despite the similar characteristics of the two metals.

In addn. to structural transitions between metastable phases of bistable or multistable host frameworks, a new guest-stabilized host phase can be created when the size of the adsorbate is larger than the empty material's pore size.  The authors then confront the findings of this approach with exptl. data for systems exhibiting phenomena such as gate opening and breathing.
