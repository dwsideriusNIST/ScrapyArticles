However, the dissocn. mechanism on most oxide surfaces is not well understood due to the exptl. challenges of prepg. surface structures and characterizing reaction pathways.  To remedy this problem, we propose the metal org. framework MOF-74 as an ideal model system to study water reactions.  Its cryst. structure is well characterized; the metal oxide node mimics surfaces with exposed cations; and it degrades in water.  Combining in situ IR spectroscopy and first-principles calcns., we explored the MOF-74/water interaction as a function of vapor pressure and temp.  Here, we show that, while adsorption is reversible below the water condensation pressure (\u223c19.7 Torr) at room temp., a reaction takes place at \u223c150 \u00b0C even at low water vapor pressures.  This important finding is unambiguously demonstrated by a clear spectroscopic signature of the direct reaction using D2O, which is not present using H2O due to strong phonon coupling.  Specifically, a sharp absorption band appears at 970 cm-1 when D2O is introduced at above 150 \u00b0C, which we attribute to an O-D bending vibration on the phenolate linker.  Although H2O undergoes a similar dissocn. reaction, the corresponding O-H mode is too strongly coupled to MOF vibrations to detect.  In contrast, the O-D mode falls in the phonon gap of the MOF and remains localized.  First-principles calcns. not only pos. identify the O-D mode at 970 cm-1 but derive a pathway and kinetic barrier for the reaction and the final configuration: the D (H) atom is transferred to the oxygen of the linker phenolate group, producing the notable O-D absorption band at 970 cm-1, while the OD (or OH) binds to the open metal sites.  This finding explains water dissocn. in this case and provides insight into the long-lasting question of MOF-74 degrdn.  Overall, it adds to the understanding of mol. water interaction with cation-exposed surfaces to enable development of more efficient catalysts for water dissocn.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXhvFaqtbnJ&md5=eafe5057bc4c3fb36230b42babb15ca2", "2.

Thermally driven heat pumps can significantly help to minimize primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions generated by industrial or domestic heating and cooling processes.

One of the most promising technologies in this context is based on the evapn. and consecutive adsorption of coolant liqs., preferably water, under specific conditions.  The efficiency of this process is first and foremost governed by the microporosity, hydrophilicity, and hydrothermal stability of the sorption material employed.  Traditionally, inorg. porous substances like silica gel, aluminophosphates, or zeolites have been investigated for this purpose.  However, MOFs are emerging as the newest and by far the most capable class of microporous materials in terms of internal surface area and micropore vol. as well as structural and chem. variability.

Here, we briefly discuss high-pressure adsorption measurements and review efforts to develop metal-org. frameworks with high methane storage capacities.  To illustrate the most important properties for evaluating adsorbents for natural gas storage and for designing a next generation of improved materials, six metal-org. frameworks and an activated carbon, with a range of surface areas, pore structures, and surface chemistries representative of the most promising adsorbents for methane storage, are evaluated in detail.  High-pressure methane adsorption isotherms are used to compare gravimetric and volumetric capacities, isosteric heats of adsorption, and usable storage capacities.  Addnl., the relative importance of increasing volumetric capacity, rather than gravimetric capacity, for extending the driving range of natural gas vehicles is highlighted.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.

Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.

Polycarbonyls, bridging CO, oxygen-bonded CO, and tilted CO are also considered.  The main part of the review is a collection of the exptl. results characterizing carbonyls of individual metal ions.  The spectral behavior of CO bonded to metal atoms is also assessed in the cases when the metal ions are easily reduced to metal (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, or Pt) or cationic carbonyls are produced after CO adsorption on supported metals (Ru, Rh, Ir, and Os).  The interaction of CO with surface OH groups is also considered.  IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO is an efficient methodol. to characterize cationic surface sites in terms of their nature, oxidn. states, coordination environment and coordinative unsatn., and location at faces, edges or corners of microcrystallites.

As a two-center approach to d.-functional theory (DFT), it combines computational efficiency with reliability and transferability.  Utilizing a minimal-basis representation of Kohn-Sham eigenstates and a superposition of optimized neutral-atom potentials and related charge densities for constructing the effective many-atom potential, all integrals are calcd. within DFT.  Self-consistency is included at the level of Mulliken charges rather than by self-consistently iterating electronic spin densities and effective potentials.  Excited-state properties are accessible within the linear response approach to time-dependent (TD) DFT.  The coupling of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom further allows us to follow the non-adiabatic structure evolution via coupled electron-ion mol. dynamics in energetic particle collisions and in the presence of ultrashort intense laser pulses.  We either briefly outline or give refs. describing examples of applications to ground-state and excited-state properties.

Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature.  However, despite many applications, std. general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional \"hard\" matter such as metals, ionic compds., and insulators are lacking.  Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and mols. on the surfaces of solids.  Here we calc. the lattice consts., bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring.

However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to av. errors which are similar to those of PBE or better.  Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs.

(using vdW-DF).  The formation and stability of H2O clusters in the hydrophobic cavities of a fluorinated metal-org. framework (FMOF-1) was examd.  Although the isotherms of water showed no measurable uptake, the large dipole of the water internal modes made it possible to detect low water concns. using IR spectroscopy in pores in the vicinity of the surface of the solid framework.  Even in the low pressure regime (100 mTorr to 3 Torr), water mols. preferentially occupied the large cavities, in which hydrogen bonding and wall hydrophobicity fostered water cluster formation.  The formation of pentameric water clusters at pressures lower than 3 Torr and larger clusters beyond that pressure was obsd.  The binding energy of the water species to the walls was negligible, as suggested by DFT computational findings and corroborated by IR absorption data.  Consequently, intermol. hydrogen bonding dominated, enhancing water cluster stability as the size of the cluster increases.  The stability of the water clusters was studied as a function of pressure redn. and in the presence of methane gas.  Methane adsorption isotherms for activated FMOF-1 attained volumetric adsorption capacities ranging from 67 V(STP)/V at 288 K and 31 bar to 133 V(STP)/V at 173 K and 5 bar, with an isosteric heat of adsorption of ca. 14 kJ/mol in the high temp. range (288-318 K).
