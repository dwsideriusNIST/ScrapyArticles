This also shows the promise of broad application of these techniques in modeling and screening compounds for sorption effects and using classical molecular geometries as inputs into electronic structure modeling of reactive phenomena.", "Examination of the energy decomposition for H", "2", " sorption using model 3 in Mg-MOF-74 revealed that polarization contributes toward a significant portion of the total energy for all state points considered. For example, polarization contributes to approximately 42% of the total energy at very low pressures at 77 K (Figure ", "3", "). This contribution slightly decreases as more sorbate molecules are introduced into the framework. Nevertheless, the large contribution from polarization at all pressures considered, especially at low pressures, indicates that the H", "2", "\u2013metal interaction in this MOF is dominated by this energetic term. Indeed, for simulations using model 3, polarization is the main contributor to the total energy for the majority of the pressure range considered at 77 K. This is in contrast to the energetic contributions that were produced using models 1 and 2, as simulations using these models in Mg-MOF-74 revealed dominance from van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, it can be observed that the inclusion of polarization significantly increases the contributions from stationary electrostatic interactions. Indeed, electrostatic interactions constitute about 30% of the total energy for model 3 in Mg-MOF-74 for nearly all pressures considered at 77 K, whereas they are approximately 12.5 and 8% for models 1 and 2, respectively. This indicates that electrostatic and polarization effects have a synergistic interaction as the inclusion of the latter results in a significant increase in the former.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

The simulations were performed using three different hydrogen potentials of increasing complexity.  Simulated hydrogen sorption isotherms and calcd. isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, values were in excellent agreement with the reported exptl. data for only a polarizable model in one of four exptl. obsd. crystal structure configurations.  The study demonstrates the ability of modeling to distinguish the differential sorption of distinct structures; one configuration is found to be dominant due to favorable interactions with substrates.  In addn., the presence of polar amide groups had a significant effect on the electrostatics of the Cu2+ ions and directs the low-pressure physisorption of hydrogen in the MOF.  This is in contrast to what was obsd. in PCN-61, where an exterior copper ion had a higher relative charge and was the favored loading site.  This tunability of the electrostatics of the copper ions via chem. substitution on the MOF framework can be explained by the presence of the neg. charged oxygen atom of the amide group that causes the interior Cu2+ ion to exhibit a higher pos. charge through an inductive effect.  Further, control simulations, taking advantage of the flexibility afforded by theor. modeling, include artificially modified charges for both Cu2+ ions chosen equal to or with a higher charge on the exterior Cu2+ ion.  This choice resulted in distinctly different hydrogen sorption characteristics in Cu-TPBTM with no direct sorption on the open-metal sites.  Thus, this study demonstrates both the tunable nature of MOF platforms and the possibility for rational design of sorption/catalytic sites and characteristics through the active interplay of theory and expt.

Simulations involving explicit many-body polarization interactions assisted in the detn. of the binding sites in rht-MOF-1 through the distribution of the induced dipoles that led to strong adsorbate interactions.  Four distinct hydrogen sorption sites were detd. from the polarization distribution: the nitrate ions located in the corners of the truncated tetrahedral cages, the Cu2+ ions of the paddlewheels that project into the truncated tetrahedral and truncated octahedral cages (Cu1 ions), the Cu2+ ions of the Cu3O trimers (Cu3 ions), and the sides of the paddlewheels in the cuboctahedral cage.  The simulations revealed that the initial sorption sites for hydrogen in rht-MOF-1 are the nitrate ions; this site corresponds to the high initial Qst value for hydrogen (9.5 kJ mol-1) in the MOF.  The radial distribution functions, g(r), about the Cu2+ ions at various loadings revealed that the Cu1 ions are the preferred open-metal sorption sites for hydrogen at low loading, while the Cu3 ions become occupied at higher loadings.  The validation of the aforementioned sorption sites in rht-MOF-1 was confirmed by calcg. the two-dimensional quantum rotational levels about each site and comparing the levels to the transitions that were obsd. in the exptl. INS spectra for hydrogen in the compd.  For each binding site, the rotational transitions from j = 0 to j = 1 were in good agreement to certain transitions that were obsd. in the INS spectra.  From these calcns., the assignment of the peaks in the INS spectra for hydrogen in rht-MOF-1 was made.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXpslGqsA%253D%253D&md5=337f5de241c465c3a3638f35c49fe4a9", "32.

In this work the problem is circumvented by introducing a new error functional which acts on the relative differences of the potential and not on its abs. values, as it is currently done with mol.

For siliceous sodalite, it is demonstrated that conventional mol. ESP approaches generate 'unphys.' charges, whereas the REPEAT method produces charges that are both chem. intuitive and consistent between different periodic electronic structure packages.  The new approach is employed to generate partial at. charges of various microporous materials and compared to both exptl. derived and mol. fragment ESP charges.
