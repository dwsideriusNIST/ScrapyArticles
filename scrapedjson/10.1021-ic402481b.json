CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approx. atm. pressures.  Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore vols. of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, resp.  Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4.  Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites.  In addn., strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chem. bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement.

This intermediate could also be synthesized by NiII-mediated reactions; however, the final triazoles were obtained only when CuII was employed.  Therefore, the reaction mechanism of these reactions was elucidated as follows: nitrile was 1st attacked by NH3 to form the amidine, which further reacted with another nitrile or self-condensed to yield 1,3,5-triazapentadiene, which was coordinated to two CuII ions in its deprotonated form.  A two-electron oxidn. of the 1,3,5-triazapentadienate mediated by two CuII ions gave one triazolate and CuI cations.  Other in situ ligand reactions, such as C-C bond cleavage and hydrolysis, were also found for the nitriles under these solvothermal conditions.  Another remarkable feature of these cryst. CuI triazolates is their simple, typical 3- or 4-connected network topologies.  The self-assembly of these nets is presumably controlled by steric hindrance, which is subsequently applied to the rational design of the close-packed 2-dimensional networks [CuI(tz)]\u221e and [AgI(tz)]\u221e (Htz = 1,2,4-triazole), as well as the porous 3-dimensional network [CuI(etz)]\u221e (Hetz = 3,5-diethyl-1,2,4-triazole).

Herein we report the construction of two highly stable MOFs (1 and 2) using elongated dicarboxylate bridging ligands derived from Cp*Ir(L)Cl complexes (L = dibenzoate-substituted 2,2'-bipyridine, bpy-dc, or dibenzoate-substituted 2-phenylpyridine, ppy-dc) and Zr6O4(OH)4(carboxylate)12 cuboctahedral secondary building units (SBUs) and the elucidation of water oxidn. pathways of the Cp*Ir(L)Cl catalysts using these MOFs.  We carried out detailed kinetic studies of Ce4+-driven water oxidn. reactions (WORs) catalyzed by the MOFs using UV-vis spectroscopy, phosphorescent oxygen detection, and gas chromatog. anal.  These results confirmed not only water oxidn. activity of the MOFs but also indicated oxidative degrdn. of the Cp* rings during the WOR.  The (bpy-dc)Ir(H2O)2XCl (X is likely a formate or acetate group) complex resulted from the oxidative degrdn. process was identified as a competent catalyst responsible for the water oxidn. activity of 1.  Further characterization of the MOFs recovered from WORs using X-ray photoelectron, diffuse-reflectance UV-vis absorption, luminescence, and IR spectroscopies supported the identity of (bpy-dc)Ir(H2O)2XCl as an active water oxidn. catalyst.  Kinetics of MOF-catalyzed WORs were monitored by Ce4+ consumptions and fitted with a reaction-diffusion model, revealing an intricate relationship between reaction and diffusion rates.

Mol. recognition, an important process in biol. and chem. systems, governs the diverse functions of a variety of enzymes and unique properties of some synthetic receptors.  Because mol. recognition is based on weak interactions between receptors and substrates, the design and assembly of synthetic receptors to mimic biol. systems and the development of novel materials to discriminate different substrates for selective recognition of specific mols. has proved challenging.  The extensive research on synthetic receptors for mol. recognition, particularly on noncovalent complexes self-assembled by hydrogen bonding and metal-org. coordination, has revealed some underlying principles.  In particular, these studies have demonstrated that the shapes of the supramol. receptors play significant roles in their specific and selective recognition of substrates: receptors can offer concave surfaces that complement their convex targets.  This Account describes our research to develop a synthetic mol. recognition platform using porous metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  These materials contain functional pores to direct their specific and unique recognition of small mols. through several types of interactions: van der Waals interactions of the framework surface with the substrate, metal-substrate interactions, and hydrogen bonding of the framework surface with the substrate.  These materials have potential applications for gas storage, sepn., and sensing.  We demonstrate a simple strategy to construct a primitive cubic net of interpenetrated microporous MOFs from the self-assembly of the paddle-wheel clusters M2(CO2)4 (M = Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) with two types of org. dicarboxylic acid and pillar bidentate linkers.  This efficient method allows us to rationally tune the micropores to size-exclusively sort different small gas mols., leading to the highly selective sepn. and purifn. of gases.  By optimizing the strong interactions between open metal sites within porous MOFs and gas mols. such as hydrogen and acetylene, we have developed several MOF materials with extraordinary acetylene storage capacity at room temp.  We have also immobilized Lewis acidic and basic sites into luminescent porous MOFs to recognize and sense neutral and ionic species.  Using the strategy to systematically immobilize different open metal sites within porous MOFs from the metallo-ligand precursors, we have developed the first microporous mixed-metal-org. framework (M'MOF) with enhanced affinity for hydrogen mols., which successfully sepd. D2 from H2 using kinetic isotope quantum mol. sieving.  Because we can functionalize the pores to direct their specific recognition of small mols., the emerging porous MOFs serve as novel functional materials for gas storage, sepn., heterogeneous catalysis, and sensing.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXlslyhtrs%253D&md5=f9230905a5656f9fe0e487967ecae356", "22.

This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

Starting from this novel ligand, seven coordination polymers [Zn2L(HCOO)3(OH)]n (1), [Cd2L2Cl4]n\u00b73nDMF\u00b73nH2O (2), [CdLBr2]n (3), [Cd6L3(SO4)6]n\u00b74nMeCN (4), [Hg2LBr4]n\u00b73nCH2Cl2\u00b7nH2O (5), [Cu2LI2]n\u00b70.5nCH2Cl2 (6), and [Ag2L(H2O)2]n(NO3)2n\u00b72nH2O (7) were synthesized.

In summary, the complex structures are dependent on the metal ions and the anions.  The flexibility of the butadiyne moiety provides addnl. means for modulating the structures.  Solid state photoluminescence of the free ligand and the complexes shows emission maxima within the range of 420-515 nm, which can be modulated by the conformations of the ligand in addn. to the variation of the metal ions and anions, and the introduction of the butadiyne unit has a bathochromic effect.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XntlOhtLk%253D&md5=61d2f0c25470dc15b88a26b10a44d1e2", "73.
