MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), a class of hybrid materials formed by the self-assembly of polydentate bridging ligands and metal-connecting points, were studied for a variety of applications.  Recently, these materials were scaled down to nanometer sizes, and this Account details the development of nanoscale metal-org. frameworks (NMOFs) for biomedical applications.  NMOFs possess several potential advantages over conventional nanomedicines such as their structural and chem. diversity, their high loading capacity, and their intrinsic biodegradability.  Under relatively mild conditions, NMOFs can be obtained as either cryst. or amorphous materials.  The particle compn., size, and morphol. can be easily tuned to optimize the final particle properties.  Researchers have employed 2 general strategies to deliver active agents using NMOFs: by incorporating active agents into the frameworks or by loading active agents into the pores and channels of the NMOFs.  The modification of NMOF surfaces with either silica coatings or org. polymers improves NMOF stability, fine-tunes their properties, and imparts addnl. functionality.  Preliminary biomedical applications of NMOFs have focused on their use as delivery vehicles for imaging contrast agents and mol. therapeutics.  Because NMOFs can carry large amts. of paramagnetic metal ions, they were extensively explored as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents.  Both Gd3+- and Mn2+-contg. NMOFs have shown excellent efficacy as T1-weighted contrast agents with large per metal- and per particle-based MR relaxivities.  Fe3+-contg. NMOFs have demonstrated excellent T2-weighted contrast enhancement.  Upon i.v. injection of iron carboxylate NMOFs in Wistar rats, researchers obsd. neg. signal enhancement in the liver and spleen, which dissipated over time, indicating the degrdn. and clearance of the NMOF.  Through the incorporation of luminescent or high Z element building blocks, NMOFs have also served as viable contrast agents for optical imaging or x-ray computed tomog. (CT) imaging.  Incorporation of membrane impermeable dyes into NMOFs allowed for their uptake by cancer cells and for their controlled release as the framework decompd.  NMOFs were used to deliver anticancer drugs and other chemotherapeutics.  Cisplatin prodrugs were incorporated within NMOFs at exceptionally high levels, either through use of the prodrug as the building block or through attachment of the prodrug onto the framework after synthesis.  These NMOFs were encapsulated within a silica shell and targeted to cancer cells.  In vitro assays revealed that the targeted NMOFs possessed similar efficacy to cisplatin, while the nontargeted NMOFs were less active.  Several different therapeutic mols. were loaded within porous iron-carboxylate NMOFs at unprecedented levels.  The NMOF showed sustained drug release with no burst effect, and in vitro assays revealed that the nanoencapsulated drug possessed similar efficacy to the free drug.  Although still at a very early stage of development, NMOFs have already shown great promise as a novel platform for nanomedicine.  The compositional tunability and mild synthetic conditions used to produce NMOFs should allow for the incorporation of other imaging and therapeutic agents and their effective delivery to targeted cells in vivo.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXntFSmsb4%253D&md5=e051a6fe645e7d401d16cfbaa9b1d74c", "8.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.

Each 2D double layer is further interlocked with two neighboring ones to form an interesting 3D polycatenation array.  Complex 4 possesses a 2D network constructed from a trinuclear [Zn3(COO)6N4] cluster and Zn-cam double-helical chain.  Complex 5 is a 3D porous MOF constructed from tridentate bpmb and hexadentate 1,3,5-btc ligands.  Complex 6 exhibits a 2-fold interpenetrating 2D wavelike (4,4) network constructed from bidentate bpmb and 1,2,4,5-H2btec ligands.  The bpmb ligand adopts four types of coordination modes in 1-6.  The secondary carboxylate ligands have obvious effects on their coordination architectures.  Tetrahedral-, octahedral-, and trigonal-bipyramidal geometries around Zn(II) ions are obsd.  A general solvothermal method is proposed for prepg. carboxylate complexes in DMF-H2O soln. without any basic additive.  In the prepn. of 3, maleic acid is converted to a fumarate ligand.  The thermal stabilities of six complexes and N2 adsorption behaviors of 1 and 3 are investigated.

SHELXL also finds a niche for the refinement of macromols. against high-resoln. or twinned data; SHELXPRO acts as an interface for macromol. applications.  SHELXC, SHELXD and SHELXE are proving useful for the exptl. phasing of macromols., esp. because they are fast and robust and so are often employed in pipelines for high-throughput phasing.  This paper could serve as a general literature citation when one or more of the open-source SHELX programs (and the Bruker AXS version SHELXTL) are employed in the course of a crystal-structure detn.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXhsVGhurzO&md5=8f91f10be4a9df74b2a9dad522c71e6e", "33.

The framework structures of these neutral polymeric complexes were detd. by the x-ray single-crystal diffraction technique.  Structural anal. reveals that the benzenedicarboxylate isomers display versatile coordination modes to manage the metal ions to form 1-dimensional chain or ribbon arrays, which are further extended via the exo-bidentate bpt connectors to give rise to a variety of coordination networks, such as a simple (4,4) layer, 2-dimensional double layer with decorated (4,4) topol., 2-dimensional layer with decorated (3,6) topol., 2-dimensional bilayer with 82.10 topol.

The accessorial secondary interactions such as H bonding and/or arom. stacking are also helpful for the extension and stabilization of the final supramol. aggregates.  This work evidently indicates that the isomeric effect of the anionic benzenedicarboxylate is significant in the construction of these network structures, which are also well regulated by the metal centers.

Here the authors present a powerful approach for the targeted manipulation of responsiveness and framework flexibility of an important family of pillared-layered MOFs based on the parent structure [Zn2(bdc)2(dabco)]n (bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane).  A library of functionalized bdc-type linkers (fu-bdc), which bear addnl. dangling side groups at different positions of the benzene core (alkoxy groups of varying chain length with diverse functionalities and polarity), was generated.  Synthesis of [Zn2(fu-bdc)2(dabco)]n yields the resp. collection of highly responsive MOFs.  The parent MOF is only weakly flexible; however, the substituted frameworks of [Zn2(fu-bdc)2(dabco)]n contract drastically upon guest removal and expand again upon adsorption of DMF, EtOH, or CO2, etc., while N2 is hardly adsorbed and does not open the narrow-pored form.  These breathing dynamics are attributed to the dangling side chains that act as immobilized guests, which interact with mobile guest mols. as well as with themselves and with the framework backbone.  The structural details of the guest-free, contracted form and the gas sorption behavior (phase transition pressure, hysteresis loop) are highly dependent on the nature of the substituent at the linker and can therefore be adjusted using the authors' approach.  Combining the authors' library of functionalized linkers with the concept of mixed-component MOFs (solid solns.) offers very rich addnl. dimensions of tailoring the structural dynamics and responsiveness.  Implementation of two differently functionalized linkers in varying ratios yields multicomponent single-phased [Zn2(fu-bdc')2x(fu-bdc'')2-2x(dabco)]n MOFs (0 < x < 1) of increased inherent complexity, which feature a nonlinear dependence of their gas sorption properties on the applied ratio of components.  Hence, the responsive behavior of such pillared-layered MOFs can be extensively tuned via an intelligent combination of functionalized linkers.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XmvV2gu7g%253D&md5=77c6f577d9bbe291f8f0acc44f27de76", "54.

Thus, these MOM are relevant to CO2 sepn. in the context of post-combustion (flue gas, CO2/N2), pre-combustion (shifted synthesis gas stream, CO2/H2), and natural gas upgrading (natural gas clean-up, CO2/CH4).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXjsFCntbg%253D&md5=56941673abb6b13f920476a593dfeb98"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/cgdefu/2014/cgdefu.2014.14.issue-12/cg500942g/20141126/images/small/cg-2014-00942g_0008.gif\">"]}
