MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.

The three isophthalate moieties in TDPAT are linked through copper paddle-wheel units to form cuboctahedral supermol. building blocks, which are covalently bonded through the isophthalate moieties (at position 1) to yield a (3,24)-connected rht-type network.  The smallest member of rht-type MOFs, Cu-TDPAT, built on a hexacarboxylate ligand with iminotriazine backbone, shows a greatly enhanced CO2 binding affinity compared with all other isoreticular rht-MOFs and remarkable selectivity of CO2 over N2 under conditions that mimic flue gas mixts.

The coordination stabilities between the central metal atoms and the ligands as well as the coordination geometry are considered to be dominant factors in this stepwise exchange mechanism.  A new magnetic anal. method and a theor. model confirmed that the exchange mechanism is reasonable.  When the metathesis reaction occurs between CuII ions and framework ZnII ions, the magnetic exchange interaction of each pair of CuII centers gradually strengthens with increasing amt. of framework CuII ions.  By analyzing the changes of coupling consts. in the Cu-exchanged products, it was deduced that Zn4 and Zn3 are initially replaced, and then Zn1 and Zn2 are replaced later.  The theor. calcn. further verified that Zn4 is replaced first, Zn3 next, then Zn1 and Zn2 last, and the coordination stability dominates the Cu/Zn exchange process.  For the Ni/Zn and Co/Zn exchange processes, besides the coordination stability, the preferred coordination geometry was also considered in the stepwise-exchange behavior.  As NiII and CoII ions esp. favor octahedral coordination geometry in oxygen-ligand fields, NiII ions and CoII ions could only selectively exchange with the octahedral ZnII ions, as was also confirmed by the exptl. results.

Upon immersion in the filtrate of 1a (namely 1a-s, freshly filtered) or 1b (namely 1b-s, filtered and then activated in air for three days), single crystal-to-single crystal (SCSC) transformations of 1a-1c to a new MOF, formulated as [Co6O2(OH)4(BTB)8/3(H2O)4]\u00b714DMF\u00b74EtOH\u00b72H2O (2), occur along with dramatic color change from blue purple to red.

H (H2) is a promising alternative energy carrier because of its environmental benefits, high energy d., and abundance.  However, development of a practical storage system to enable the H Economy remains a huge challenge.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are an important class of cryst. coordination polymers constructed by bridging metal centers with org. linkers.  MOFs show promise for H2 storage owing to their high surface area and tuneable properties.  In this Account, the authors summarize the authors' research on novel porous materials with enhanced H2 storage properties and describe frameworks derived from 3,5-substituted dicarboxylates (isophthalates) that serve as versatile mol. building blocks for the construction of a range of interesting coordination polymers with Cu(II) ions.  The authors synthesized materials by connecting linear tetracarboxylate linkers to {Cu(II)2} paddlewheel moieties.  These materials exhibit high structural stability and permanent porosity.  Varying the org. linker modulates the pore size, geometry, and functionality to control the overall H2 adsorption.  The authors' top-performing material in this series has a H2 storage capacity of 77.8 mg g-1 at 77 K, 60 bar.  H2 adsorption at low, medium, and high pressures correlates with the isosteric heat of adsorption, surface area, and pore vol., resp.  Another series, using tribranched C3-sym. hexacarboxylate ligands with Cu(II), gives highly porous (3,24)-connected frameworks incorporating {Cu(II)2} paddlewheels.  Increasing the length of the hexacarboxylate struts directly tunes the porosity of the resultant material from micro- to mesoporosity.  These materials show exceptionally high H2 uptakes owing to their high surface area and pore vol.  The 1st member of this family reported adsorbs 111 mg g-1 of H2, or 55.9 g L-1, at 77 K, 77 bar, while at 77 K, 1 bar, the material adsorbs 2.3 wt. \u0302 H2.  The authors and others have since achieved enhanced H2 adsorption in these frameworks using combinations of polyphenyl groups linked by alkynes.  The max. storage achieved for one of the enhanced materials is 164 mg g-1 at 77 K, 70 bar, but because of its low d., its volumetric capacity is only 45.7 g L-1.  The authors attribute the significant adsorption of H2 at low pressures to the arrangement of the {Cu24(isophthalate)24} cuboctahedral cages within the polyhedral structure.  Free metal coordination positions are the 1st binding sites for D2, and these frameworks have two types of Cu(II) centers, one with its vacant site pointing into the cuboctahedral cage and another pointing externally.  D2 mols. bind 1st at the former position and then at the external open metal sites.  Design of ligands and complexes is key for enhancing and maximizing H2 storage, and although current materials operate at 77 K, research continues to explore routes to high capacity H2 storage materials that can function at higher temps.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhslSgtb%252FI&md5=cc8254d032b3130032ff7577e2a0615e", "(b) ", "Sun", ", ", "D.

The transformation is catalyzed by coordinatively unsatd. Mn2+ ions that serve as Lewis acids and lead to conversion yields of 98 and 90% for benzaldehyde and 1-naphthaldehyde, the highest thus far for a metal-org. framework.  Larger carbonyl substrates cannot diffuse through the pores of I, and conversion yields are much lower for these, attesting to the heterogeneity of the reaction and its dependence on guest size.  The Mukaiyama-aldol reaction, known to require much more active Lewis catalysts, is also catalyzed in the presence of I, representing the first such example for a metal-org. framework.  Conversion yields obtained for the reaction of benzaldehyde with silyl enolate Me2C:C(OMe)OSiMe3 reach 63%, on par with those obtained with zeolites.
