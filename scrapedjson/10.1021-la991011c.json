The procedures to calc. micropore size distributions are examd. and compared.  The accuracy of procedures based on the Dubinin-Radushkievich equation is questioned, since the DR equation does not adequately represent the vol. filling of uniform micropores.  The Horwath-Kawazoe method is shown to reasonably reproduce the shape of the micropore size distribution only when micropores below ca 0.9 nm in width prevail for a given sample.  In other cases, a significant distortion of the micropore size distribution can be expected, since the method attributes the monolayer formation to the presence of nonexisting 0.6 nm micropores.  The numerical methods employing local adsorption isotherms obtained from computer simulation or nonlocal d. functional theory are recommended for calcns. of micropore size distributions.

The results obtained show that CO2 adsorbs at 273 K in the different ranges of porosity following a mechanism similar to that of N2 at 77 K.  CO2 is sensitive to narrow micropores not accessible to N2 at 77 K, and hence, it is an adequate complement to N2 at 77 K.
