The high resolution and large separation factors exhibited by CD-MOFs for benzene and these alkylaromatics provide an efficient, reliable, and green alternative to current isolation protocols.

Some simple general principles concerning the design and construction of these frameworks are presented together with reasons for expecting them to show unusual and useful properties.  Two of the simplest conceivable systems of this type are isomorphous Zn(CN)2 and Cd(CN)2 whose structures were reexamd. by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, confirming the earlier description based on powder diffraction data of 2 interpenetrating diamond-related frameworks: cubic, space group P\u203e43m, Z = 2; with a 5.9002(9) \u00c5 (Zn(CN)2) and 6.301(1) \u00c5 (Cd(CN)2); 2 unique metal centers, 1 surrounded tetrahedrally by 4C and the other by 4N donors; MCNM rods linear; Zn-C 1.923(6), Zn-N 2.037(5), Cd-C 2.099(5), Cd-N 2.196(4), C-N 1.150(5) \u00c5 in Zn(CN)2, and 1.162(5) \u00c5 in Cd(CN)2.  The interpenetration of sep. frameworks demonstrated in these archetypal structures is likely to be a major concern in future studies of more complex scaffolding materials.  [N(CH3)4][CuZn(CN)4] was deliberately designed to demonstrate one conceivable way of preventing interpenetration; it is cubic, space group F\u203e43m, with A 11.609(3) \u00c5; Z = 4.  The structure contains a single diamond-related framework with alternating tetrahedral Cu(I) and Zn(II) centers and linear rods that are very likely of the type CuCNZn with bond distances Cu-C 1.877(8) and Zn-N 2.069(15) \u00c5, Z(CH3)4+ ions occupy half the adamantane cavities generated by the framework, the remaining cavities being vacant.  CuI[4,4',4'',4'''-tetracyanotetraphenylmethane]BF4\u00b7xC6H5NO2 (x \u2265 7.7) represents the first attempt to generate an infinite 3-dimensional framework with rods of some complexity.  It is tetragonal, space group I\u203e4m2, with a 13.620(2) and c 22.642(2) \u00c5; Z = 2.  The structure contains a diamond-related cationic framework with C\u00b7C6H4\u00b7CN\u00b7Cu rods of length 8.856(2) \u00c5.  The framework is tetragonally elongated along the c axis apparently as a result of nonbonded interactions between the 8 ortho-H atoms around the methane C centers.  There is no interpenetration.  The framework generates very large adamantane-like cavities occupied by disordered C6H5NO2 (at least 7.7 mols. per Cu) together with BF4- ions.  The crystals undergo ready anion exchange.  The material is unusual in that approx. two thirds by vol. of what is undoubtedly a crystal is effectively liq.

So far, the inability of these open frameworks to support permanent porosity and to avoid collapsing in the absence of guest mols., such as solvents, has hindered further progress in the field.  The authors report the synthesis of a metal-org. framework, Zn4O(BDC)3.(DMF)8.(PhCl) (named MOF-5, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), which remains cryst., as evidenced by x-ray single-crystal analyses, and stable when fully desolvated and when heated up to 300\u00b0.  This synthesis is achieved by borrowing ideas from metal carboxylate cluster chem., where an org. dicarboxylate linker was used in a reaction that gives supertetrahedron clusters when capped with monocarboxylates.  The rigid and divergent character of the added linker allows the articulation of the clusters into a three-dimensional framework resulting in a structure with higher apparent surface area and pore vol. than most porous cryst. zeolites.

MOFs with interesting properties in terms of bio-compatibility and porosity: CDMOF-1, based on edible precursors; MOF-74 contg. a highly biocompatible metal (Mg); and BioMOF-100, a mesoporous MOF with extremely high pore vol.  By comparing with exptl. data, we show how GCMC simulation is able to predict the macroscopic performance of new porous MOFs in drug delivery applications, providing useful mol.-level insights and giving thermodn. and structural details of the process.  Adsorption isotherms, snapshots, energy of adsorption and radial distribution functions were used to analyze the drug delivery process.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXhtFKrtrc%253D&md5=6aa0777ec7f011aa2b1339b9510d958f", "(m) ", "Yoon", ", ", "S.

The role of framework flexibility and specific structural features, such as windows and pore cavities, within the MOF porous structures are discussed in relation to adsorption mechanisms.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXot1CgtbY%253D&md5=349cfccbf029fb292e6be84f9c730a04", "(b) ", "Matsuda", ", ", "R.", "; ", "Kitaura", ", ", "R.", "; ", "Kitagawa", ", ", "S.", "; ", "Kubota", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Belosludov", ", ", "R.

One of the advantages of MOMs compared to other microporous materials, such as activated carbons, is their ability to exhibit a variety of pore surface properties such as hydrophilicity and chirality, as a result of the controlled incorporation of org. functional groups into the pore walls.  This capability means that the pore surfaces of MOMs could be designed to adsorb specific mols.; but few design strategies for the adsorption of small mols. have been established so far.

All three materials have spacious cages that are accessible via narrow cage windows with a diam. of less than 0.5 nm.

Within the diolefin fraction, MIL-96 and chabazite preferentially adsorb trans-piperylene from a mixt. contg. all three C5-diolefin isomers with high sepn. factors and a higher capacity compared to the ref. zeolite 5A due to a more efficient packing of the trans isomer in the pores.

Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.

Diffusivities obtained from previous simulations greatly overestimated the transport rates of CH4 and, to a lesser extent, CO2.

The most important observation from the calcns. is that the characteristics of CO2/CH4 diffusion in DDR are very different from the usual situation in nanoporous materials, where the presence of a slowly diffusing species retards transport rates of a more rapidly diffusing species.  In DDR, CO2 diffusion rates are only weakly affected by the presence of CH4, despite the very slow diffusion of the latter mols.

In an attempt to study the effect of structural degrdn. upon VOC adsorption, multiple samples of IRMOF-1 with widely ranging properties were investigated.  Trends in the differential enthalpies and equil. consts. for the adsorption of VOCs were detd. on the basis of the mol. properties of the adsorbate and the structural properties of the MOF sample.

Samples of IRMOF-1 with sp. surface areas of around 1000 m2/g show heats of adsorption for alkanes that are higher than those estd. previously via Monte Carlo calcns.  Although the data for nonpolar (and weakly polar) species showed many of the anticipated trends for the interactions with IRMOF-1, the equil. behavior of polar VOCs did not correlate well with the mol. properties of the adsorbate (i.e., vapor pressure and deformation polarizability), leaving some uncertainty about the nature of the interaction mechanism.  The equil. data and the heats of adsorption were found to fit well to a small group of mol. descriptors through the application of the Abraham linear free-energy relationship, thus providing insight into the complex interactions between the MOF structure and the VOC compds.  Hydrogen bonding interactions were detd. to be the primary contributors to specific interactions between adsorbates and the MOF surface.

Thus, there were clear confinement effects when MO was capped at both ends by two CD mols.  The obsd. changes of ultrafast dynamics and yield of the isomer were explained in terms of CD-MO interactions and a steric effect.  In the case of \u03b3-CD, which included two MO mols. as a dimer, these confinement effects were also obsd. even when each MO was capped on only one side (2:1 complex).  These results showed that a strong intermol. interaction was induced between two MO mols. by confinement in a nanospace and this also hindered the isomerization.  In particular, the complex with two \u03b3-CD mols. (2:2 complex) showed significantly slower relaxation than the others, and no cis isomer was formed.

This review describes the synthesis, properties, and, in particular, biomedical and pharmaceutical applications of an upcoming class of polymeric networks and assemblies based on cyclodextrins (CDs).  CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides composed of \u03b1-1,4-coupled D-glucose units, which contain a hydrophobic internal cavity that can act as a host for various, generally lipophilic, guest mols.  Because of this unique physicochem. property, commonly referred to as inclusion complex formation, CDs have often been used to design polymeric materials, such as hydrogels and nanoparticles.  Polymeric systems based on CDs exhibit unique characteristics in terms of mech. properties, stimuli-responsiveness, and drug release characteristics.  In this contribution, first, an outline is given of covalently crosslinked polymeric networks in which CD moieties were structurally incorporated to modulate the network strength as well as the complexation and release of low mol. wt. drugs.  Second, phys. assembled polymeric systems are discussed, of which the formation is accomplished by inclusion complexes between polymer-conjugated CDs and various guest mol.-derivatized polymers.  Due to their phys. nature, these polymeric systems are sensitive to external stimuli, such as temp. changes, shear forces and the presence of competing CD-binding mols., which can be exploited to use these systems as injectable, in situ gelling devices.  In recent years, many interesting CD-contg. polymeric systems have been described in literature.

In most cases, org. host-guest complexes were selected as examples, but biol. relevant problems are also considered.

Aiming to construct various novel supramol. polymeric structures in aq. soln. beyond small supramol. self-assembly mols. and develop functional supramol. polymeric materials, research interest on functional supramol. polymers was prevailing in recent years.  Supramol. polymers are formed by bridging monomers or components together via highly directional noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, metal-ligand coordination, electrostatic interaction, and so forth.  They can be easily functionalized by employing diverse building components with specific functions besides the traditional polymeric properties, a no. of which are responsive to such external stimuli as pH variance, photoirradn., chem. or electrochem. redox with the controllable conformation or construction switching, polymn. building and rebuilding, and function adjustment reversibly owing to the reversibility of noncovalent interactions.  Supramol. polymers are \"soft matters\" and can be functionalized with specific properties such as morphol. adjustment, controllable luminescence, shape memory, self-healing, and so forth.  Supramol. polymers constructed based on macrocycle recognition and interlocked structures represent one typical branch of the supramol. polymer family.  Cyclodextrin (CD), cucurbituril (CB), and hydrophilic calixarene derivs. are usually employed to construct hydrophilic supramol. polymers in aq. soln.  Stimuli-responsive hydrophilic supramol. polymers, constructed in aq. soln. particularly, can be promising candidates for mimicking biocompatible or vital functional materials.  This Account mainly focuses on the recent stimuli-responsive supramol. polymers based on the host-guest interaction in aq. soln.  We describe the hydrophilic supramol. polymers constructed via hydrophobic effects, electrostatic interaction, metal-ligand coordination, and multiple combinations of the above noncovalent interactions.  The disparate ways to engender stimuli-responsive supramol. polymers via the hydrophobic effects of \u03b1-CD, \u03b2-CD, and \u03b3-CD macrocycles are illustrated and discussed.  Some recent works on CD-based photoresponsive functional supramol. polymers are summarized.  CB (esp. CB[8]) based supramol. polymers and their pH-responsive and photoresponsive properties are introduced.  Hydrophilic calixarene deriv. (bis(p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene) typically) based supramol. polymers via electrostatic interactions are reviewed, and their redox-responsive assocn./disassocn. elaborated in detail.  More complicate supramol. polymers based on multiple noncovalent interactions are illustrated including hydrophobic effect, metal-ligand coordination, and electrostatic interactions and their functional stimuli-responsiveness elaborated as well.  Finally, we give perspectives on the strength of these diverse noncovalent interactions to form supramol. polymers in aq. soln., on the advantage, disadvantage, efficiency, and reversibility of using certain stimuli in constructing supramol. polymers and prospect the future function improvement of these polymers as functional materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXkvVyrsrY%253D&md5=011639287baec613c4ac9633fe359c67", "(y) ", "Harada", ", ", "A.", "; ", "Takashima", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Nakahata", ", ", "M.", " ", "Acc.

Cyclodextrins (CDs) have many attractive functions, including mol. recognition, hydrolysis, catalysis, and polymn.  One of the most important uses of CDs is for the mol. recognition of hydrophobic org. guest mols. in aq. solns.  CDs are desirable host mols. because they are environmentally benign and offer diverse functions.  This Account demonstrates some of the great advances in the development of supramol. materials through host-guest interactions within the last 10 years.  In 1990, we developed topol. supramol. complexes with CDs, polyrotaxane, and CD tubes, and these prepn. methods take advantage of self-organization between the CDs and the polymers.  The combination of polyrotaxane with \u03b1CD forms a hydrogel through the interaction of \u03b1CDs with the OH groups on poly(ethylene glycol).  We categorized these polyrotaxane chemistries within main chain type complexes.  At the same time, we studied the interactions of side chain type supramol. complexes with CDs.  In these systems the guest mols. modified the polymers and selectively formed inclusion complexes with CDs.  The systems that used low mol. wt. compds. did not show such selectivity with CDs.  The multivalency available within the complex cooperatively enhances the selective binding of CD with guest mols. via the polymer side chains, a phenomenon that is analogous to binding patterns obsd. in antigen-antibody complexes.  To incorporate the mol. recognition properties of CDs within the polymer side chains, we first prepd. stimuli-responsive sol-gel switching materials through host-guest interactions.  We chose azobenzene derivs. for their response to light and ferrocene derivs. for their response to redox conditions.  The supramol. materials were both redox-responsive and self-healing, and these properties resulted from host-guest interactions.  These sol-gels with built in switches gave us insight for creating materials that were self-healing or could serve as artificial muscle.  Furthermore, we developed another self-healing material with CD inclusion complexes that showed selective self-healing properties after its surface was cut.  These CD self-healing materials do not include chem. cross-linkers; instead the inclusion complex of CDs with guest mols. stabilized the material's strength.  However, by introducing chem. cross-linkers into the hydrogels, we produced materials that could expand and contract.  The chem. cross-linked hydrogels with responsive groups bent in response to external stimuli, and the cross-linkers controlled the ratio of inclusion complexes.  Furthermore, we used the mol. recognition of CDs to achieve macroscopic self-assemblies, and this chem. can direct these macroscopic objects into even larger aggregated structures.  As we have demonstrated, reversible host-guest interactions have tremendous potential for the creation of a wide variety of functional materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXpsFejt7w%253D&md5=7148e6d8245af8c069a3957a4ed76afb", "(aa) ", "Yang", ", ", "C.", "; ", "Inoue", ", ", "Y.", " ", "Chem.

Supramol. photochirogenesis is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary area of science at the boundary of photochem., asym. synthesis and supramol. chem.  The major advantage of supramol. photochirogenesis over the conventional mol. one is entropic in origin, being achieved by preorganizing substrate(s) in the ground state and manipulating subsequent photochem. transformation by weak but non-transient interactions in chiral supramol. media.  The chirality transfer often becomes more efficient through the cooperative non-covalent interactions and the confinement by host in both ground and excited states.  Thus, all of the ground- and excited-state events, including complexation stoichiometry and affinity, chiroptical properties, photophys. behavior and photochem. reactivity, jointly play pivotal roles in supramol. photochirogenesis.  This may appear to cause complication but in reality expands the range of manipulable factors and available exptl./theor. tools for elucidating the mechanism and controlling photochirogenic processes both thermodynamically and kinetically, from which some new concepts/methodologies unique to supramol. photochem., such as non-sensitizing catalytic photochirogenesis and wavelength-controlled photochirogenesis, have already been developed.
