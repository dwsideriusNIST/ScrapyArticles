Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.

In this report, we describe the modular synthesis of novel dipyrazole ligands contg. naphthalenediimide cores functionalized with -H (H2NDI-H), -NHEt (H2NDI-NHEt), or -SEt (H2NDI-SEt) groups.

The Type V water adsorption isotherms measured for these materials show water uptake in the 40-50% relative humidity range, suggesting hydrophobic channel interiors.  Postsynthetic oxidn. of Zn(NDI-SEt) with dimethyldioxirane was used to generate Et sulfoxide and Et sulfone groups, thereby rendering the channels more hydrophilic, as evidenced by shifts in water uptake to the 30-40% relative humidity range.

To illustrate this concept, water adsorption studies were performed on four novel, methyl-functionalized DMOF variations along with a no. of already reported functionalized analogs contg. polar (fluorine) and nonpolar (methyl) functional groups on the BDC ligand.  These results are distinctly different from previous reports where the apparent water stability is improved through the inclusion of functional groups such as -CH3, -C2H5, and -CF3 which only serve to prevent significant amts. of water from adsorbing into the pores.  In this study, the authors present the first demonstration of tuning the inherent kinetic stability of MOF structures in the presence of large amts. of adsorbed water.  Notably, while the parent DMOF structure is unstable, the DMOF variation contg. the tetra-Me BDC ligand remains fully stable after adsorbing large amts. of water vapor during cyclic water adsorption cycles.  These trends cannot be rationalized in terms of hydrophobicity alone; exptl. water isotherms show that MOFs contg. the same no. of Me groups per unit cell will have different kinetic stabilities and that the precise placements of the Me groups on the BDC ligand are therefore critically important in detg. their stability in the presence of water.  Water adsorption isotherms, PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) patterns, and BET surface areas before and after water exposure are presented to illustrate these trends.  Furthermore, the important distinction between kinetic and thermodn. stability in MOFs is discussed.  Mol. simulations are also used to provide insight into the structural characteristics governing these trends in kinetic water stability.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhslyltLbK&md5=dd3cb8bf8450c769ce9f5856751aedab", "(b) ", "Taylor", ", ", "J.

The structure of Cd complex 2 consists of double layers, and a unique bond was found between the Cd2+ cation and a Cl atom of clodronate.  Zn complex 3 consists of 1-dimensional chains, but the binding of the bisphosphonate ligands is unique: in 3 the bisphosphonate ligand is only bidentate.  Compd. 4 is a tetramer, and H bonds hold the tetramers together, forming a layered structure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXitFegu7s%253D&md5=30a53eb16a67d787f0fae4a3be15efd0", "16.
