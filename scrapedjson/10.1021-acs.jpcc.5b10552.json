Activated carbon and zeolites are state-of-art adsorbents which may be used for CO2 adsorption, however physisorption alone tends to be insignificant at high temps.  In the present work, com. adsorbents were impregnated with monoethanolamine (MEA) and triethanolamine (TEA) to investigate the effect of the modified surface chem. on CO2 adsorption, esp. above room temp.  Adsorption isotherms for CO2, N2, and CH4 were measured in a gravimetrically system in the pressure range of UHV to 10 bar, at 298 and 348 K for activated carbon and zeolite 13X supports.  The adsorbed concn. of CO2 was significantly higher than those of CH4 and N2 for both adsorbents in the whole pressure range studied, zeolite 13X showing a remarkable affinity for CO2 at very low pressures.  However, at 348 K, the adsorbed concn. of CO2 decreases significantly.  The supports impregnated with concd. amine solns. and dried in air suffered a detrimental effect on the textural properties, although CO2 uptake became much less susceptible to temp. increase.  Impregnations carried out with dil. soln. followed by drying in inert atm. yielded materials with very similar textural characteristics as compared to the parent support.  CO2 isotherms in such materials showed a significant change with similar capacities at 348 K as compared to the original support at 298 K in the case of activated carbons.  The impregnated zeolite showed a decrease in adsorbed phase concn. in low pressures for a given temp., but the adsorbed amt. also seemed to be less affected by temp.  These results are promising and indicate that CO2 adsorption may be enhanced despite high process temps.

A direct study of the effect of pore size was made possible by comparing the uptake capacity of porous carbons with identical surface areas but with different pore sizes and pore size distributions.  A variety of synthesis methods were used to prep. carbon materials with similar surface areas with pore sizes ranging from the micropore range (12 \u00c5) to supermicropore/lower mesopore (23 \u00c5) and lower mesopore (31 \u00c5) range.  This allowed a simple and straightforward anal. of the effect of pore size without any changes in total surface area.  The pore size essentially defines the hydrogen uptake with no apparent regard to the similar surface areas.  The excess and total hydrogen uptake (at -196\u00b0 and 20 bar) of carbons with identical surface areas of 3340 m2/g, increased from 3.7-5.4 wt. % (31 \u00c5 sample), to 4.8 and 6.3 wt. % (23 \u00c5 sample) and to 6.3 and 7.3 wt. % for a 12 \u00c5 sample.  The excess hydrogen storage d. (\u03bcmol H2\u00b7m-2) decreases linearly with pore size from 9.5 at 12 \u00c5 to 7.3 at 23 \u00c5, and 5.5 at 31 \u00c5.  Thus at a surface area of 3340 m2/g, a change of pore size from 31-12 \u00c5 improves the excess hydrogen storage by a staggering 70%.  The pore size effect has general applicability; for carbons with similar surface areas of 2770 m2/g, the excess and total hydrogen storage was 1.7 and 3.0 wt. % for a 28 \u00c5 sample and increased to 5.6 and 6.4 wt. % for and 15 \u00c5 sample.  In this case, a change of pore size from 28 to ca. 15 \u00c5 results in a more than 3-fold increase in excess hydrogen storage.  Therefore, to improve hydrogen storage capacity of carbons, the surface area has to be increased, but with pores of the right size.  A high surface area and pore vol. assocd. with large pores cannot compensate for unfavorably sized pores.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XhslSmsbfF&md5=123a772428830ce2446490379e5b25e9", "49.
