Flexible MOFs combine the cryst. order of the underlying coordination network with cooperative structural transformability.  These materials can respond to phys. and chem. stimuli of various kinds in a tunable fashion by mol. design, which does not exist for other known solid-state materials.  Among the fascinating properties are so-called breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host-guest interactions.  Phase transitions are triggered by guest adsorption/desorption, photochem., thermal, and mech. stimuli.  Other important flexible properties of MOFs, such as linker rotation and sub-net sliding, which are not necessarily accompanied by crystallog. phase transitions, are briefly mentioned as well.  Emphasis is given on reviewing the recent progress in application of in situ characterization techniques and the results of theor. approaches to characterize and understand the breathing mechanisms and phase transitions.  The flexible MOF systems, which are discussed, are categorized by the type of metal-nodes involved and how their coordination chem. with the linker mols. controls the framework dynamics.

A crit. materials challenge over the next quarter century is the sustainable use and management of the world's natural resources, particularly the scarcest of them.  Chem.'s ability to get more from less is epitomized by porous coordination polymers, also known as metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), which use a min. amt. of material to build max. surface areas with fine control over pore size.  Their large sp. surface area and tunable porosity make MOFs useful for applications including small-mol. sensing, sepn., catalysis, and storage and release of mols. of interest.  Proof-of-concept projects demonstrated their potential for environmental applications such as carbon sepn. and capture, water purifn., carcinogen sequestration, byproduct sepn., and resource recovery.  To translate these from the lab. into devices for actual use, however, will require synthesis of MOFs with new functionality and structure.  This Account summarizes recent progress in the use of nano- and microparticles to control the function, location, and 3-dimensional structure of MOFs during MOF self-assembly, creating novel, hybrid, multifunctional, ultraporous materials as a first step towards creating MOF-based devices.  The use of preformed ceramic, metallic, semiconductive, or polymeric particles allows the particle prepn. process to be completely independent of the MOF synthesis, incorporating nucleating, luminescent, magnetic, catalytic, or templating particles into the MOF structure.  Success in combining functional nanoparticles and porous crystals for applications including mol. sieve detectors, repositionable and highly sensitive sensors, pollutant-sequestering materials, microfluidic microcarriers, drug-delivery materials, separators, and size-selective catalysts are discussed.  In sections within the Account, the authors describe how functional particles can be used for (1) heterogeneous nucleation (seeding) of MOFs, (2) prepn. of framework composites with novel properties, (3) MOF positioning on a substrate (patterning), and (4) synthesis of MOFs with novel architectures.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhslGgs7rL&md5=80e3d5c2e3af624564330b7f41c0b6d9", "5.

In one case, 3, a mixed metal ion system (Co2+/Na+) was obtained.  First, the reaction of H4TCTA with Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O together with the linear bridging coligand BPY (4,4'-bipyridine) afforded a mixt. of two 3D frameworks of types [Co2(TCTA)(BPY)]n (1) and [Co2(TCTA)(BPY)2(H2O)4]n (2).

In such complexes, the hemidirected coordination sphere of a HAT Pb(II) cation provides sufficient space for an addnl. binding of a neutral ligand (e.g., DMSO).  Studies of the HAT metal coordination mode in a single strap porphyrin show that a HAT Pb(II) can also interact via intermol. coordination bonds, allowing the self-assembly of two bimetallic complexes.

The ligand is constituted of a triazacyclononane (TACN) cap and three pyridine (PY) spacers connected to the calix[6]arene small rim.  The resulting N6 donor site coordinates PbII ions to give complexes that are highly stable.  X-ray diffraction structures reveal a hemidirected environment for PbII with strong coordination to the TACN cap and weaker bonds with the three PY residues.  A guest mol., either H2O or EtOH, sitting in the calixarene macrocycle and H-bonded to the phenoxyl units at the level of the small rim further stabilizes the complexes through electrostatic interactions with the metal center and the calixarene core.  In-depth 1H NMR studies confirm the host-guest behavior of the complexes in soln., with evidence of embedment of neutral guest mols. such as EtOH, BuOH, and N-methylformamide.  Hence, in spite of the presence of a N6 donor, the calixarene macrocycle can be open to guest interaction, giving rise to seven-coordinate dicationic complexes.  Noteworthy also is the flexibility of the macrocycle that allows PbII to adopt its preferred hemidirected environment in spite of the three covalent links connecting the calixarene core to the three PY groups.  The flexibility of the system is further illustrated by the possible coordination of an exogenous anionic ligand in the exo position.

Thus, the authors synthesized a 1,2-cyclohexenedicarboxylate of Cd, [Cd(1,2-CHeDC)(H2O)] (I), a 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate of Pb, [Pb(1,2-CHDC)] (II), and three 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylates of La [La2(1,4-CHDC)3(H2O)4] (III), [La3(1,4-HCHDC)2(1,4-CHDC)5(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (IV) and [La2(1,4-CHDC)3(H2O)]\u00b72.5H2O (V) under hydrothermal conditions and detd. their structures.  A mixed dicarboxylate involving both 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexenedicarboxylates of Pb, [Pb3O(1,3-CHDC)(1,4-CHDC)]\u00b70.5H2O (VI) and a 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate of Pb, [Pb6O2(1,4-CHDC)3(1,4-HCHDC)2], also were synthesized and characterized.  While the 1,2-dicarboxylates have layered structures, the 1,4-dicarboxylates and the mixed dicarboxylates possess three-dimensional structures.  Both the 1,2- and 1,4-dicarboxylates are true hybrid compds. composed of infinite M-O-M linkages.  The equatorial-equatorial (e,e) conformation is adopted commonly in all these compds., although less stable conformations are encountered occasionally.  The formation of the layered and the three-dimensional structures can be understood based on the relative disposition of the two carboxylic groups, the 1,4-isomer favoring the three-dimensional structure.  Based on the results of the present study along with the available literature, to obtain three-dimensional hybrid structures with metal-O-metal networks, it appears necessary to make use of the 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2sXks1Smuro%253D&md5=74e9505cefd362f345ccf2ae374baa97", "47.
