The Fe atom is, in both compds., bonded to the 4 porphyrinato N atoms (Np), the S atom of the axial thiolate and 1 O atom of the axially end-on bonded O2 mol.  The av. Fe-Np distance found in III [1.994(4) \u00c5] is not significantly different from that found in II [1.993(3) \u00c5].  The Fe-S bond length is 2.367(3) \u00c5 in II and 2.365(2) \u00c5 in II.  The Fe-O1 distances with the O atom of O2 bonded to Fe are resp. 1.837(9) \u00c5 and 1.850(4) \u00c5.  The end-on bonded O2 mol. is disordered in both complexes III and II.  This disorder is, however, slightly different from one structure to the other.  Whereas the terminal O atom of O2 occupies 2 positions in III [\u03c4(O2A) = 78%, \u03c4(O2B) = 22% at 20\u00b0], it occupies 3 sites in II [\u03c4(O2A) = 51%, \u03c4(O2B) = \u03c4(O2C) = 24.5% at -100 \u00b0C] (where \u03c4 = occupancy).  The est. of the magnitude of the nonbonded interactions between O2 and its environment located in a sphere of 7-\u00c5 radius in III and II is consistent with a static disorder of O2 in III and a dynamic distribution in II.  Moessbauer measurements were performed with polycrystals of III and II in the temp. ranges 5-197 and 4.2-295 K, resp., and under an externally applied magnetic field (6.76 T) at 4.2 K (III and II) and at 173 K (II).  The temp. variation of the Lamb-Moessbauer factor indicates that the Fe atom in these oxycytochrome P 450 models is not very firmly bonded, and is more like that in pentacoordinated than in other hexacoordinated hemes.  From the specific temp. behavior of the quadrupole splitting, asymmetry parameter, and line width obtained for II, the structural disorder of the terminal O atom of O2 is identified as a dynamic distribution over 3 different sites.  Corresponding values obtained for II are consistent with a static disorder of O2.

Now constituting thousands of distinct examples, metal-org. frameworks are an intriguing class of hybrid materials that exist as infinite cryst. lattices with inorg. vertices and mol.-scale org. connectors.  Useful properties such as large internal surface areas, ultralow densities, and the availability of uniformly structured cavities and portals of mol. dimensions characterize functional metal-org. frameworks.  Researchers have effectively exploited these unusual properties in applications such as hydrogen and methane storage, chem. sepns., and selective chem. catalysis.  One of the most attractive features of metal-org. frameworks is the simplicity of their synthesis.  Typically they are obtained via one-pot solvothermal prepns.

PSMet was applied to enhance the performance characteristics of parent MOFs for gas storage and sepn., and catalysis.  Notably, PSMet is a prominent strategy in the field of MOF catalysis as it offers a route to design size-selective catalysts, based on the premise of reticular chem. in MOFs and the ability to incorporate a range of catalytically-active metal centers.  Other applications for materials produced via or using PSMet strategies include enhancing gas storage or mol. sepns., the triggered release of drugs, sensing and tunable light emission for luminescent materials.

The six porphyrinate ligands utilized were tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP), tetramesitylporphyrin (TMP), and a series of \"hindered\" tetraphenylporphyrins having substituents (OCH3, F, Cl, Br) on both ortho positions of each of the four Ph rings.  The perchlorato salts of the iron(III) porphyrinates were utilized for the titrns.  The axial ligands utilized were N-methylimidazole, 2-methylimidazole, and pyridines of basicities ranging in pKa(PyH+) from 9.7 to 1.1.  From the electrochem. titrn., the equil. consts. (log \u03b22 and some log \u03b21) of each iron porphyrinate with each ligand were detd.  The values of log \u03b22 for the iron(III) complexes decrease in the order Br > Cl > CH3 > OCH3 > H > F, while those for iron(II) decrease in the slightly modified order Br > Cl > CH3 > F > OCH3 > H.  Rather than electronegativity or electron-donating/withdrawing characteristics, these results appear to follow primarily the phys. size of the ortho substituents: The iron porphyrinates with the largest ortho substituents have the largest equil. consts.  The hindered (TPP)FeII complexes are usually, but not always, more stable than the corresponding hindered (TPP)FeIII complexes.  For both (TPP)FeIII and the hindered (TPP)FeIII complexes, the slope of the correlation of log \u03b22III with the pKa of the conjugate acid of the pyridine ligand is 1.0.  The equil. consts. for hindered (TPP)FeII complexes, however, have virtually no dependence upon the base strength of the axial pyridines, while those for (TPP)FeII has a slight sensitivity, with a slope of 0.15.  In contrast to common belief, 2-methylimidazole readily forms bis complexes with some iron(II) tetraphenylporphyrinates (TMP)FeII, ((2,6-Cl2)TPP)FeII, and ((2,6-Br2)4(TPP)FeII), although it does not with (TPP)FeII and its (2,6-F2)4- and (2,6-(OCH3)2)4- counterparts.  N-Methylimidazole is unique among the axial ligands of this study, in that the equil. consts. for binding to both Fe(III) and Fe(II) are virtually identical for all porphyrinates studied.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28Xksl2gsLc%253D&md5=9fc2997fb389a2d527e72dccfe01bea5", "(b) ", "Wu", ", ", "Y.", "; ", "Komatsu", ", ", "T.", "; ", "Tsuchida", ", ", "E.", " ", "Inorg.

The redox behavior of the rHSA-FeP hybrid fits well with thin-film electrochem.: (1) the redox potential (E1/2) of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple in the hybrid was always const.; however, (2) the peak current and sepn. increased depending on the scan rate.  Because the isoelec. point (pI) of rHSA-FeP is 4.8, its electron d. becomes higher with an increase in pH of the aq. soln. (pH 4-9) and the E1/2 shifts to the anodic side.  The counter anions and their concn. affect the E1/2, suggesting that the counter anions participate in the redox reaction.  Compared with that of the naked FeP in aq. soln., the E1/2 of rHSA-FeP shifts in the cathodic direction.  This indicates that the hydrophobic environment in the albumin host makes the Fe(II) state difficult to oxidize.  An increase in the no. of the combined FeP mol.(s) in rHSA from 1 to 4 and 8 results in a pos. shift of the E1/2.
