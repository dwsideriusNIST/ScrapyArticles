In this context, porous hybrid solids, with the ability to tune their structures and porosities for better drug interactions and high loadings, are well suited to serve as nanocarriers for delivery and imaging applications.  Here we show that specific non-toxic porous iron(III)-based metal-org. frameworks with engineered cores and surfaces, as well as imaging properties, function as superior nanocarriers for efficient controlled delivery of challenging antitumoral and retroviral drugs (i.e., busulfan, azidothymidine triphosphate, doxorubicin or cidofovir) against cancer and AIDS.

In this review, the authors describe two recently implemented conceptual approaches facilitating the design and deliberate construction of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), supermol. building block (SBB) and supermol. building layer (SBL) approaches.  The authors' main objective is to offer an appropriate means to assist/aid chemists and material designers alike to rationally construct desired functional MOF materials, made-to-order MOFs.  The authors introduce the concept of net-coded building units (net-cBUs), where precise embedded geometrical information codes uniquely and matchlessly a selected net, as a compelling route for the rational design of MOFs.  This concept is based on employing pre-selected 0-periodic metal-org. polyhedra or 2-periodic metal-org. layers, SBBs or SBLs, resp., as a pathway to access the requisite net-cBUs.  In this review, inspired by the authors' success with the original rht-MOF, the authors extrapolated the authors' strategy to other known MOFs via their deconstruction into more elaborate building units (polyhedra or layers) to (i) elucidate the unique relation between edge-transitive polyhedra or layers and minimal edge-transitive 3-periodic nets, and (ii) illustrate the potential of the SBB and SBL approaches as a rational pathway for the design and construction of 3-periodic MOFs.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.  Assocd. with each net is a natural tiling, which is a natural partition of space into space-filling tiles.

However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "(b) ", "Dan-Hardi", ", ", "M.", "; ", "Serre", ", ", "C.", "; ", "Frot", ", ", "T.", "; ", "Rozes", ", ", "L.", "; ", "Maurin", ", ", "G.", "; ", "Sanchez", ", ", "C.", "; ", "F\u00e9rey", ", ", "G.", " ", "J.

An extensive body of research results currently exists from the synthesis of metalorg. frameworks (MOFs), an area that has attracted widespread attention due to the facility with which well-defined mol. building blocks can be assembled into periodic frameworks and the promise that such a process holds for the logical design of materials.  The synthesis of MOFs generally involves the copolymn. of org. links and metal ions in a polar solvent under mild temps. (up to 200\u00b0) and autogenous pressures (up to 100 atm).  Since most products can be considered kinetically driven and lie on local thermodn. min., factors such as soly. of the org. link and metal salt, solvent polarity, ionic strength of the medium, temp. and pressure play crit. roles in detg. the character of products.  Indeed, slight perturbations in synthetic parameters were the basis for the prepn. of what seems to be a flood of new MOF compds.  In the spirit of this discussion the authors advance the following ideas and developments that the authors believe contribute to the maturity of the field: (I) a conceptual framework that unifies the processes involved in the designed synthesis of MOFs, and which can be extended to other materials with extended structures; (II) a thesis concerning the possible structures that may form from building blocks with various shapes; (III) important considerations for achieving the design and synthesis of frameworks in which it is possible to change chem. functionality and metrics without changing the underlying framework topol.; (IV) the inevitability of porosity for designed structures and some factors affecting framework stability; (V) insights on catenation:interpenetration vs. interweaving, forbidden catenation, and duals.

HKUST-1, a material that is com. available in gram scale, exhibits a room-temp. volumetric methane uptake that exceeds any value reported to date.  The total uptake is \u223c230 cc(STP)/cc at 35 bar and 270 cc(STP)/cc at 65 bar, which meets the new volumetric target recently set by the Department of Energy (DOE) if the packing efficiency loss is ignored.  The authors emphasize that MOFs with high surface areas and pore vols. perform better overall.  NU-111, for example, reaches \u223c75% of both the gravimetric and the volumetric targets.  Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.  Hence, one of the important challenges going forward is to find ways to pack MOFs efficiently without serious damage or to synthesize MOFs that can withstand substantial mech. pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtV2msbrN&md5=23f9bfad78f204569f0bf7c902d42dca", "22.

Specifically, tbo-MOF-2 and its isoreticular, functionalized analog, tbo-MOF-2-{CH2O[Ph(CO2H)2]}2 (or tbo-MOF-3), which is characterized by pendant isophthalic acid moieties freely pointing into the cavities, were evaluated on the basis of potential use in methane storage and C2+/CH4 sepn.  The parent, tbo-MOF-2, showed high gravimetric and volumetric CH4 uptake, close to the U.S.  Department of Energy (DOE) target for methane storage at 35 bar and room temp.  Though the presence of the pendant isophthalic acid moiety in the analogous compd., tbo-MOF-3, led to a decrease in total CH4 uptake, due mainly to the reduced size of the cavities, interestingly, it increased the affinity of the SBL-based tbo-MOF platform for propane, propene, ethane, and ethylene at low pressures compared with CH4, due addnl. to the enhanced interactions of the highly polarizable light hydrocarbons with the isophthalic acid moiety.  Using Ideal Adsorption Soln. Theory (IAST), the predicted mixt. adsorption equil. for the C3H8/CH4, C3H6/CH4, C2H6/CH4, C2H4/CH4, and C3H8/CO2 systems showed high adsorption selectivity for C2+ over methane for tbo-MOF-3 compared with tbo-MOF-2.  The high working storage capacity of tbo-MOF-2 and the high affinity of tbo-MOF-3 for C2+ over CH4 and CO2 make tbo-MOF an ideal platform for studies in gas storage and sepn.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXhsl2gsLzP&md5=d08332520fd26b8f7af6cdd01666cdea"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-16/jacs.5b00450/20150423/images/small/ja-2015-004507_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-16/jacs.5b00450/20150423/images/small/ja-2015-004507_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-16/jacs.5b00450/20150423/images/small/ja-2015-004507_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-16/jacs.5b00450/20150423/images/small/ja-2015-004507_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-16/jacs.5b00450/20150423/images/small/ja-2015-004507_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-16/jacs.5b00450/20150423/images/small/ja-2015-004507_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2015/jacsat.2015.137.issue-16/jacs.5b00450/20150423/images/small/ja-2015-004507_0002.gif\">"]}
