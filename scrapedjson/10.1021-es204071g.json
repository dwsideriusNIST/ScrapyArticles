Most mols. adsorb weakly on SWNTs and can be either charge donors or acceptors to the nanotubes.  We find that the gas adsorption on the bundle interstitial and groove sites is stronger than that on individual nanotubes.  The electronic properties of SWNTs are sensitive to the adsorption of certain gases such as NO2 and O2.  Charge transfer and gas-induced charge fluctuation might significantly affect the transport properties of SWNTs.

We use local d. approxn. d. functional theory (LDA-DFT) calcns. to compute the adsorption energies and vibrational frequencies for CO2 adsorbed on SWNT bundles.  The LDA-DFT calcns. give a range of shifts for the asym. stretching mode from about -6 to -20 cm-1 for internally bound CO2, and a range from -4 to -16 cm-1 for externally bound CO2 at low densities.  The magnitude of the shift is larger for CO2 adsorbed parallel to the SWNT surface; various perpendicular configurations yield much smaller theor. shifts.  The asym. stretching mode for CO2 adsorbed in groove sites and interstitial sites exhibits calcd. shifts of -22.2 and -23.8 cm-1, resp.  Vibrational mode softening is due to three effects: (1) dynamic image charges in the nanotube; (2) the confining effect of the adsorption potential; (3) dynamic dipole coupling with other adsorbate mols.  IR measurements indicate that 2 families of CO2 adsorption sites are present.  One family, exhibiting a shift of about -20 cm-1 is assigned to internally bound CO2 mols. in a parallel configuration.  This type of CO2 is readily displaced by Xe, a test for densely populated adsorbed species, which are expected to be present on the highest adsorption energy sites in the interior of the nanotubes.  The second family exhibits a shift of about -7 cm-1 and the site location and configuration for these species is ambiguous, based on comparison with the theor. shifts.  The population of the internally bound CO2 may be enhanced by established etching procedures that open the entry ports for adsorption, namely, ozone oxidn. followed by annealing in vacuum at 873 K.

(GGA) type for general chem. applications termed B97-D is proposed.  It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6\u00b7R-6.  A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common d. functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported.  The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on std. thermochem. benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked arom. mols. and group II element clusters, and for the computation of mol. geometries.  Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for std. functionals.  In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean abs. deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol-1.  The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the av. CCSD(T) accuracy.  The basic strategy in the development to restrict the d. functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interat. distances by damped C6\u00b7R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions.  As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference.  From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chem. method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XhtFenu7bO&md5=0b4aa16bebc3a0a2ec175d4b161ab0e4", "33.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from large point sources such as power plants is one option for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions; however, currently the capture alone will increase the energy requirements of a plant by 25-40%.  This review highlights the challenges for capture technologies which have the greatest likelihood of reducing CO2 emissions to the atm., namely postcombustion (predominantly CO2/N2 sepn.), precombustion (CO2/H2) capture, and natural gas sweetening (CO2/CH4).  The key factor which underlies significant advancements lies in improved materials that perform the sepns.  In this regard, the most recent developments and emerging concepts in CO2 sepns. by solvent absorption, chem. and phys. adsorption, and membranes, amongst others, will be discussed, with particular attention on progress in the burgeoning field of metal-org. frameworks.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhtVaqu7fL&md5=96d81f8aa4797c4de5bd02965fa9fa5f"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/esthag/2012/esthag.2012.46.issue-3/es204071g/production/images/small/es-2011-04071g_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/esthag/2012/esthag.2012.46.issue-3/es204071g/production/images/small/es-2011-04071g_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/esthag/2012/esthag.2012.46.issue-3/es204071g/production/images/small/es-2011-04071g_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/esthag/2012/esthag.2012.46.issue-3/es204071g/production/images/small/es-2011-04071g_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/esthag/2012/esthag.2012.46.issue-3/es204071g/production/images/small/es-2011-04071g_0002.gif\">"]}
