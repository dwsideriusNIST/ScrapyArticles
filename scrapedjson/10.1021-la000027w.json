The BET assumptions are analyzed from physical point of view, and properly generalized to handle geometrical as well as energetic conditions for multilayer adsorption in microporous structures. A formal description of multilayer adsorption is derived, by using the thermodynamic approach, with any energy profile across the layers being admitted. To get an analytical formula describing the process one proposes to assume an exponential distribution of pore capacity, and apply the BET equation with limited number of layers. Formal properties of the obtained formula, referred to as LBET model, are carefully examined and compared with those of Dubinin\u2212Radushkievith and BET equations. The examination showed that the LBET model describes adequately adsorption process on materials of submicroporous and microporous structure with dominant fraction of small micropores. It provides reliable information on the porous surface capacity and on the first layer adsorption energy. It gives also a semiquantitative characterization of pore volume distribution.

The first question has been discussed before. In general, it cannot be answered in empirical way only. Acceptability of the Assumptions 1 and 2 can viewed only as a hypothesis, which may be taken if empirical data do not provide any reasonable basis to reject it. To answer the second question, model 28 has been examined from its formal side by computer calculation. The rigorous formula, eq 10, was used to calculate \u201cempirical\u201d adsorption isotherms with parameters corresponding to typical natural adsorbent-methanol systems (see Table 2). Both, the normal distribution of pore size and the exponential distribution of pore capacity were taken under study (referred to as adsorbents nos. 1n to 5n, and nos. 1e to 5e, respectively", "see Table 1).

Notice that this is the area where applicability of formula 10 is also doubtful (see comments to Figure 1). ", " ", "4. The LBET model underestimates the total capacity of pores (see quantity ", "m", "VAe", " and its relation to the true capacity of pores ", "m", "VA", " listed in Table 1). However, if the parameter ", "B", "C", " (i.e., ", "Q", "n", "/", "RT", ") applied to the LBET formula 28 is close to its real value used in eq 10, the ratio ", "m", "VAe", "/", "m", "VA", " is roughly the same for different structures of micropores. Thus, information being provided with the model on the structure of pores is qualitatively consistent with the \u201ctrue\u201d structure. In the case of the normal distribution of pore size, the total capacity of pores is evaluated a bit better than for the exponential distribution. The parameter \u03b1 determined by the model fitting is lower than its actual value taken for adsorbents 1e\u22125e, and lower than the value approximating the structure of adsorbents 1n\u22125n (see Tables 1 and 2). Discrepancies are much larger if the value for ", "B", "C", " used in the formula 28 is lower than its real value (used in eqs 10) (compare rows 6\u221210 and 31\u221235 with remaining ones in Table 2). It is because formula 28 is not able to distinguish between geometrical end energetic effects (represented by \u03b1 and ", "B", "C", ", respectively), causing a decrease in multilayer adsorption. Hence, the same isotherm treated with the LBET model assuming different ", "B", "C", ", produces different values for \u03b1, although very good fitting may be reached in each case. It means that actual value for ", "B", "C", " cannot be reliably determined by fitting of the model to empirical data.

The Dubinin\u2212Radushkievitch formula, in its linear form, fits perfectly adsorption data calculated with formula 10 over recommended pressure range", "6", " in each case under study (see Figures 3b to 7b). Nevertheless, the surface and volume characterization obtained with this model is much poorer than provided with the LBET formula (see Table 2). Moreover, adsorption isotherms calculated with the DR model essentially deviates from the theoretical ones, starting from \u03a0* > 0.1. The only case where differences are moderately small is shown in Figure 5 (see also rows 21\u221225 in Table 2). It suggests that the DR formalism is applicable to microporous adsorbents of very narrow spectrum of pore volume with moderate average value, or in general, to adsorbents of rather low adsorptivity.

The 1st improvement expands the area of applicability of a lattice-gas model for description of adsorption of sym. particles on amorphous surfaces.  The 2nd improvement raises the accuracy of detn. of a microporous system vol.  A new approach to calcg. the equil. characteristics of the adsorption of spherically sym. mols. on heterogeneous surfaces of adsorbents was developed.  The new method was applied to adsorption of Ar atoms on an amorphous TiO2 (rutile) surface.  On amorphous surfaces, adsorption centers are located chaotically and the distances between neighboring local min. of potential energy vary over a wide range.  At adsorption of inert gases on amorphous surfaces, situations are possible where there is blocking by adspecies of several nearest adsorption centers.  Therefore in general, the problem of the calcn. of adspecies adsorption on amorphous surfaces represents a problem of adsorption of multisite particles on heterogeneous surfaces.  Intermol. adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are taken into account for nearest atoms in a quasichem. approxn.  The energies of the lattice parameters of the all interactions of model are defined from the Lennard-Jones potential (12-6).  The offered method gives a satisfactory quant. description of the isosteric heat of adsorption and isotherm of adsorption in the submonolayer region.  The std. procedure of an estn. of micropore vol. with help from the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation results in overestimated sizes.  Thus the filling of micropore vol. occurs at pressures considerably smaller than vapor satd. pressure.  The last fact is caused by joint influence of potentials of the adsorbate-wall and adsorbate-adsorbate.  A more exact finding of micropore vol. with estn. of the pressure of filling of the micropore vol. is suggested.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1MXjt1Sjtrk%253D&md5=acb698b933efd763c6917de8b6a3c775", " ", " ", "(15)", "\u2002", "Dubinin, M.
