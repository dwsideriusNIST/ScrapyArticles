Both methods are envisaged to allow for the simultaneous encoding of different types of host\u2013guest interactions. In our first approach, we evaluated the sensing performance of the tandem MOF BSs (i.e., the combination of ZIF-8 layers with either HKUST-1 or CAU-1-NH", "2", ") by conducting similar sorption measurements as those for the TiO", "2", "/MOF BSs (see Figures S10\u2013S13 for reflectance spectra, ", "Supporting Information", ").

We rationalize this finding with the different adsorption capacities of the MOFs: By taking into account the low adsorption capacity of HKUST-1, which we deduce from the sorption data of the bulk material (Figure S3 and Table S1, ", "Supporting Information", "), and the sorption measurements of TiO", "2", "/HKUST-1 (Figure ", "4", "b, c), the signal for the uptake in the pores of HKUST-1 is likely overlapped by the comparatively larger signal caused by the interaction of the sorptive with ZIF-8. By increasing the thickness of HKUST-1 layers, which can be facilely done through multiple spin-coating steps, the magnitude of the HKUST-1 response may increase as well. In order to test this assumption, we prepared a series of tandem MOF BSs with different relative layer thicknesses of the individual MOFs and repeated the adsorption experiments. The integration of differing amounts of MOFs is confirmed by EDX analysis (Table S4, ", "Supporting Information", ").

The isotherms for ZIF-8/CAU-1-NH", "2", " show clear, yet somewhat less pronounced, characteristic features of the respective single-component BSs compared to ZIF-8/HKUST-1. This finding may be explained by a mutual influence arising from the presence of direct interfaces between the two MOFs, which, along with the sequence of the multilayer, may affect the individual sorption behavior of the MOFs. Such effects have been already described for oxide bilayers exhibiting different (textural) porosities", "(57)", " or binary Janus MOF coatings", "(58)", " and may also occur in our tandem MOF BSs, leading to a somewhat synergistic sensing behavior.

While the response of ZIF-8/HKUST-1 toward the investigated analytes seems to be characterized by the sorption properties of the individual BS components, the ZIF-8/CAU-1-NH", "2", " BS shows a more complex response that may be mediated by the mutual interactions between its layers. Despite these differences in the sensing behavior of the two tandem MOF BSs, the versatility of such multilayers is demonstrated by tailoring the sorption properties toward a particular analyte through the judicious choice of the constituting MOF structures as well as by fine-tuning the dimensions of the individual layers. The impact of these parameters and their tailoring toward a specific sorption profile is currently being investigated in our group.", "In our second approach toward enhanced analyte specificity, we pursued the fabrication of an arrayed setup assembled from multiple MOF-based multilayers. In general, arrayed sensing devices are built up of different sensing films arranged in a specific pattern. Depending on the transduction scheme, the sensor\u2013analyte interaction generates a unique signature with enhanced analyte specificity in comparison to that of the individual sensors, owing to the combinatorial response. As a first step toward such an array derived from photonic MOF multilayer structures, we arranged all three MOF-based BSs on a glass substrate in a home-built chamber (see Figure S15, ", "Supporting Information", ", for images of the setup and the array). In this chamber, a stream of nitrogen saturated with the analyte was injected, and the evolution of the color upon analyte uptake was monitored in situ with a camera attached to the microscope.", "As illustrated in Figure ", "7", ", showing optical images of the individual films, the PC array exposed to ethanol vapor shows a clearly visible color change in comparison to the array subjected to pure nitrogen.

Fashioning MOFs into various shapes and at the same time controlling their size constitute an essential step toward MOF-based devices.  Moreover, downsizing MOFs to the nanoscale triggers a whole new set of properties distinguishing nanoMOFs from their bulk counterparts.  Therefore, dimensionality-controlled miniaturization of MOFs enables the customised use of nanoMOFs for specific applications where suitable size and shape are key prerequisites.  In this feature article we survey the burgeoning field of nanoscale MOF synthesis, ranging from classical protocols such as microemulsion synthesis all the way to microfluidic-based techniques and template-directed epitaxial growth schemes.  Along these lines, we will fathom the feasibility of rationally designing specific MOF nanomorphologies-zero-, one- and two-dimensional nanostructures-and we will explore more complex \"second-generation\" nanostructures typically evolving from a high level of interfacial control.  As a recurring theme, we will review recent advances made toward the understanding of nucleation and growth processes at the nanoscale, as such insights are expected to further push the borders of nanoMOF science.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XmtlGhtb4%253D&md5=4cf541c12a9292be8918670933bcc3ef", "17.

The adsorption characteristics of nitrogen, Ar, CO2, nitrous oxide and EtOH and MeOH vapors on Ni2(4,4'-bipyridine)3(NO3)4 were studied over a range of temps. as a function of pressure.  Isotherm steps were obsd. for both CO2 and nitrous oxide adsorption at \u223c10-20% of the total pore vol. and at \u223c70% of total pore vol. for MeOH adsorption.  The adsorption kinetics obey a linear driving force (LDF) mass transfer model for adsorption at low surface coverage.  At high surface coverage, both MeOH and EtOH adsorption follow a combined barrier resistance/diffusion model.  The rates of adsorption in the region of both the CO2 and MeOH isotherm steps were significantly slower than those obsd. either before or after the step.  X-ray diffraction studies at various MeOH loadings showed that the host structure disordered initially but underwent a structural change in the region of the isotherm step.  These isotherm steps are ascribed to discrete structural changes in the host adsorbent that are induced by adsorption on different sites.  Isotherm steps were not obsd. for EtOH adsorption, which followed a Langmuir isotherm.  Previous x-ray crystallog. studies showed that all the sites are equiv. for EtOH adsorption on Ni2(4,4'-bipyridine)3(NO3)4, with the host structure undergoing a scissoring motion and the space group remaining unchanged during adsorption.  The activation energies and preexponential factors for MeOH and EtOH adsorption were calcd. for each pressure increment at which the linear driving force model was obeyed.  There was a good correlation between activation energy and ln(preexponential factor), indicating a compensation effect.  The results are discussed in terms of reversible adsorbate/adsorbent (guest/host) structural changes and interactions and the adsorption mechanism.

Unique color fingerprints can be obtained at analyte concns. below 2 ppm, and responses to below 100 ppb have been obsd.  We expect that this type of sensing array will be of practical importance for general-purpose vapor dosimeters and analyte-specific detectors (for insecticides, drugs or neurotoxins, for example).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3cXmt1CgsLw%253D&md5=b83111cb318dcc4525e1aaea704902a2", "41.

Its capability to selectively adsorb different gas mols. renders this material a promising candidate for applications in chem. gas and vapor sensing.  Here, the authors explore details of the host-guest interactions between HKUST-1 and various analytes under different environmental conditions and study the vapor adsorption mechanism by mass-sensitive and work-function-based readouts.  These complementary transduction mechanisms were successfully applied for the detection of low ppm (2 to 50 ppm) concns. of different alcs.

Evaluation of the results allows for the comparison of the amts. of adsorbed vapors and the contribution of each vapor to the changes of the electronic properties of Cu-BTC.  The influence of the length of the alc. chain (C1-C3) and geometry (1-propanol, 2-propanol) as well as their polarity on the sensing performance was studied, revealing that in dry air, short chain alcs. are more likely adsorbed than long chain alcs., whereas in humid air, this preference is changed, and the sensitivity toward alcs. is generally decreased.  The adsorption mechanism is revealed to differ for dry and humid atms., changing from a site-specific binding of alcs. to the open metal sites under dry conditions to weak physisorption of the analytes dissolved in surface-adsorbed water reservoirs in humid air, with the signal strength being governed by their relative concn.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2cXpvFCks7k%253D&md5=b741cfadeae123eaf39bde84066bba23", "57.
