They are also known as coordination polymers [", "1", "], and constitute an emergent family of nano-porous materials. The effort made by the scientific community with these materials is widely justified by their exceptional porosity and compositional/topological versatility. This applies to their microporosity and textural properties with Langmuir surface areas even reaching 10,000\u00a0m", "2", "/g [", "2", "], and pore volumes up to 3\u00a0cm", "3", "/g. At least 2,000 different topologies have been reported by varying the nature of the metal (practically any metal in the periodic table), its coordination, and the size of the cluster structure, the nature of ligands (chain length, functional groups, etc.) [", "3", "]. MOFs may be prepared with more than one metal or more than one ligand, or functionalized after synthesis. In addition they show peculiar structural effect such as the breathing effect [", "4", "], or interpenetration of networks [", "5", "]. Finally, the nature and arrangement of the metal or metal clusters give some intrinsic properties: magnetic, optical, semiconductor, etc. Consequently, MOFs are by far the largest known family of materials, and their growth continues unabated.", "The synthesis of MOFs is frequently performed by solvothermal methods: heating a mixture of organic linker and metal salt in solvent system, that usually contains formamide functionality, to temperatures near or above the boiling point of the solvent. These methods often yield crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, but have the obvious disadvantage of being relatively slow (hours to weeks) and energy demanding. Furthermore, solvothermal conditions are unsuitable for thermally sensitive starting materials. Our approach focuses on the direct preparation of MOFs under more sustainable conditions. In particular, MOFs synthesized at room temperature, and whereby the harmful organic solvents are substituted partly by water. Though room temperature methods are described for the synthesis of some MOFs, the methods were based on addition of an amine [", "6", ", ", "7", ", ", "8", ", ", "9", ", ", "10", ", ", "11", ", ", "12", "]. The amine was added to a joint metal and ligand solution, so that precipitation occurs by abrupt change of pH. The method has been developed almost exclusively for the synthesis of MOF-5 [", "6", "]. Although these studies have not explicitly discussed the role of the amine, most likely the amine causes the deprotonation of the ligand, predisposing it to react with the metal ion in the solution.", "In this study, we have selected MOF materials that are formed from 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid or terephthalic acid (H", "2", "BDC) as organic linkers and Zn(OAc)", "2", "\u00b72H", "2", "O as the metal ion source. The influence of different solvents in the absence of amines, with particular interest in surveying the use of water was investigated. Among the synthesis conditions evaluated, the room temperature synthesis of MOF-2, Zn\u2013BDC, was achieved with a metal to linker ratio of 1.74 and with a H", "2", "O to DMF ratio of 3.

If so, for a given organic linker, the right choice of the metal source as a function of the solubility in the synthesis media becomes essential. For instance, MOF-74 materials can be instantaneously formed at room temperature by mixing solutions of the metal acetate with the corresponding organic ligand [", "8", ", ", "12", "], whereas a perfect clear solution is formed if acetate is substituted by nitrate. In this context, acetate was selected as anion of the Zn source instead of the most conventional chloride or nitrate. Because of the excessive high solubility of the two latter anions, the precipitation process (i.e. the formation of MOF) slows down or is even avoided.", "Figure\u00a0", "1", " shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the Zn\u2013BDC materials prepared at room temperature from different H", "2", "O/DMF ratio mixtures. When water is used as the only solvent (Sample 1) both for the metal salt [Zn(OAc)", "2", "\u00b72H", "2", "O] and the linker (H", "2", "BDC), a crystalline phase was formed. The powder XRD pattern of this phase is equivalent to that of the structure\u00a07 [Zn(BDC)(H", "2", "O)", "2", "] reported by Wright et al. [", "13", "]. This phase, which consists in of a \u201czig-zag\u201d arrangement of distorted tetrahedral Zn atoms linked through organic molecules BDC, was not prepared directly in Ref. [", "13", "] but by irreversible transformation of some other Zn\u2013BDC phases after being further hydrated, which somehow supports its formation in our DMF-free pure-H", "2", "O system. Although the applied interest of this material could be rather negligible, it is relevant to highlight that a kind of MOF can be formed at room temperature from a system in which the organic linker is practically insoluble (H", "2", "BDC is not soluble in water at all). In other words, the great affinity between Zn and BDC", "2\u2212", " could either facilitate the solubility of H", "2", "BDC or even a Zn\u2013BDC phase could be formed without the need of BDC species are soluble. On the other hand, using DMF as the unique solvent both for the metal salt and the linker (Sample 5), the archetype MOF called MOF-5 [Zn", "4", "O(BDC)", "3", "] was precipitated as pure phase. The properties of this 3-D highly-porous material and its subsequent potential applications are well-known [", "14", "]. Moreover, the synthesis of MOF-5 at room temperature has already been reported [", "6", ", ", "9", "], also using DMF as solvent, so the preparation of MOF-5 under these conditions was actually expected.", " ", "Open image in new window", " ", "Fig.\u00a01", " ", "X-ray diffraction patterns of the room temperature Zn\u2013BDC materials prepared from different H", "2", "O/DMF ratio mixtures", " ", " ", "Away from pure solvent systems, the samples 2, 3 and 4 possess different XRD patterns to these of samples 1 and 5 (Fig.\u00a0", "2", ").

Although this sample could not be identified with any other reported Zn\u2013BDC material, its XRD pattern resembles these reported of the two resultant compounds from the evacuation of MOF-2, Zn(BDC)(DMF)(H", "2", "O), at different time/temperature treatments: the (semi-)desolvated compounds Zn(BDC)(DMF) (90\u00a0\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min) and Zn(BDC) (190\u00a0\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min).

Three weight losses are clearly observed: the first weight loss (5.9\u00a0wt%) centered at 98\u00a0\u00b0C arises from the desorbed water (H", "2", "O) and the second weight loss (25.6\u00a0wt%) centered at 206\u00a0\u00b0C is due to the removal of occluded DMF molecules. The third sharp weight loss (43.0\u00a0wt%) at 515\u00a0\u00b0C comes from the decomposition of the organic species in the framework, indicating an acceptable stability of the framework. The residual weight after heating the sample at 900\u00a0\u00b0C was of 25.5\u00a0wt% and the only crystalline phase detected by powder XRD was ZnO. According to this quantification from TGA analysis, assuming that no amorphous phase accompanies the detected ZnO in the solid resultant of the TGA treatment, and considering reasonable that the oxygen atoms of the residual ZnO phase come from the BDC, the formula weight of the sample MOF-2 prepared at room temperature was (Zn)", "0.98", "(BDC)", "1.00", "(DMF)", "1.09", "(H", "2", "0)", "1.03", ", which is very good agreement to the formula (Zn)(BDC)(DMF)(H", "2", "O) reported for MOF-2 by Yaghi et al.
