The incorporation of catalytic centers inside MOF is another challenge that has been addressed by Lin", "(4)", " and others.", "(5)", " For the design of MOF, carboxylic acid derivatives have been extensively used as organic precursors since many of them are commercially available (e.g., trimesic acid, phthalic acid) and because several porous and thermally stable structures have been produced. Besides the use of carboxylic acid, other functional groups have been employed for the formation of a metal organic network and notably the phosphonic acid group.", "(6)", " Whatever the type of functional group present on the organic precursor, the synthesis of hybrid materials having a three-dimensional (3D) network has been achieved by using, for instance, specific synthetic conditions (e.g., ionothermal conditions", "(7)", ") or by the involvement of specifically designed organic building blocks. Following the second strategy, original polycarboxylates", "(8)", " or polyphosphonic acids", "(9)", " have been synthesized and used for the design of hybrid structures. Another class of original organic building blocks is composed by the molecules possessing at least two distinct functional groups that have the ability to form an extended network with a selected inorganic precursor. The recent work of Morris et al.", "(10)", " illustrates the interest of using hetero-polyfunctional organic precursors to design MOFs. Indeed, the use of a sulfonic-dicarboxylate derivative leads these authors to identify a solid that shows low-pressure selectivity toward nitric oxide. In this subclass of heterodifunctional organic precursors, those possessing both carboxylic and phosphonic acid functional groups have been used for the design of hybrid structures. Originally, most of the difunctional organic precursors possessed a flexible structure due to the location of the functional groups on a flexible alkyl chain.", "(11)", " It should be noted that the presence of two functional groups directly bonded on a rigid backbone (e.g., an aromatic ring) can produce rigid molecules that can have a template role during the formation of the hybrid structure. Recent work by F\u00e9rey and co-workers", "(12)", " has shown that the introduction of some flexibility (e.g., the separation of carboxylic acid and aromatic ring with a methylene tether) does not produce isostructural materials due to the higher flexibility of the organic precursor.", "(13)", " Hybrid materials constructed from rigid hetero-polyfunctional organic precursors are not numerous. Nevertheless, over the last five years rigid heterodifunctional organic building units have been synthesized and engaged in the synthesis of hybrid materials as illustrated by the following combinations: sulfonic acid/phosphonic acid,", "(14)", " pyridine oxide/carboxylic acid,", "(15)", " pyridine/carboxylic acid,", "(16)", " phosphonic/carboxylic,", "(17, 18)", " pyridine/phosphonic acid,", "(19)", " or heterotrifunctional precursor (pyridine/carboxylic acid/phosphonic acid", "(20)", "). The production of a hybrid structure with this kind of heterofunctional organic building block offers a new synthetic challenge since the synthetic conditions can generate structures in which either one or two types of functional groups can be connected to the inorganic network. Recently, we have shown that this kind of chemioselectivity occurs in the course of the reaction of 3-phosphonobenzoic acid (3-PBA) with zinc nitrate. It was observed that at low pH only the phosphonic acid is bonded to the inorganic network while at higher pH both types of functional groups were directly connected to the inorganic network leading to the production of a 3D hybrid network.", "(17)", " The same organic precursor 3-PBA associated with copper salt produced once again a two-dimensional (2D) network at low pH with free carboxylic acid functional groups, but an original homochiral helical structure at higher pH was obtained.", "(21)", " Finally, the association of 3-PBA with lead", "(22)", " or lanthanum", "(23)", " salts produced other original structures. These recent results clearly demonstrate that rigid heteropolyfunctional organic molecules attract precursors since control of the synthetic conditions (e.g., pH, nature of the inorganic precursor) can produce either a 2D or 3D hybrid network.", "The 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring constitutes an interesting rigid scaffold that has been widely studied for the generation of extended hybrid networks.

This new compound completes the series of molecules, largely used as building blocks for the design of a MOF, possessing a 1,3,5-benzene structure substituted by phosphonic, carboxylic acid, or a mixture of both functionalities. This molecule possesses a limited number of conformations since the functionalities are directly bonded on a benzene ring. This property allows its classification among rigid hetero-polyfunctional molecules. This compound, due to the presence of functionalities having the capacity to form a hybrid network (phosphonic and carboxylic acid), has been engaged in hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of copper salts. The addition of urea in the reaction vessel was needed to control the pH of the reaction media and to yield crystalline samples. The rigidity of the organic precursor and the position of the functionalities on the benzene ring dictate the final structure of the MOF.
