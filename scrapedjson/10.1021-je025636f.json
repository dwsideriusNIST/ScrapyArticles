The isosteric heats of adsorption of CFC-115 on both adsorbents are of approx. the same order of magnitude as the heats of condensation.  This means that CFC-115 adsorption on both adsorbents is primarily due to phys. forces.  CFC-115 was converted to CF3CF2H (HFC-125) with >99% selectivity by hydrodechlorination over Pd/C.

The transition from localized to mobile adsorption (in the first adsorbed layer) takes place at rather low temps. for potential barriers of around 1000 cal./mole or less, so that localized phys. adsorption should be a very rare phenomenon at the temps. usually used in adsorption expts.  Since the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (and Langmuir) isotherm actually assumes localized adsorption, a new approx. isotherm equation is derived on the basis of a mobile first layer obeying a two-dimensional van der Waals' equation.  This isotherm is in semiquant. agreement with the two-dimensional phase changes observed by Jura, et al., and by earlier workers, at very low pressures.  The localized-mobile transition in the adsorption of H by metals is mentioned briefly.  The relations between (1) the two-dimensional equation of state of a monolayer, (2) the adsorption isotherm of the monolayer, and (3) the ordinary three-dimensional equation of state of the gas being adsorbed are discussed in some detail.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaH28XislWrsA%253D%253D&md5=2aefc7807289012f39628cd74bbe806c", "14.
