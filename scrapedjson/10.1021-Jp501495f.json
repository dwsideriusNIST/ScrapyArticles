Since we also want to establish a correlation between pore size and gas uptake in the presence of a constant OMS SBU using the ", "nbo", "-MOFs, it is necessary to select a method for quantifying pore dimensions. Viewing all five ", "nbo", " structures with the ", "c", "-axis aligned along the horizontal (", "Figure S1", "), one can clearly see that increasing the length of the ligand expands the large spherical cavity. However, as will be seen below, the shapes of these pores are much more irregular than those of MOF-74, making it less clear how to quantitatively rank them. We employed two basic approaches: empirical models used to fit measured adsorption isotherms and computational methods that use the MOF crystal structure to compute the LCD and PLD. The former provide a direct link to the actual synthesized materials, which may provide insight concerning the effectiveness of the activation process, while the latter yield values free of deleterious effects of incomplete activation (e.g., pore collapse or unremoved guest molecules). Unfortunately, both suffer from their own ambiguities resulting from the irregular nature of MOF pores. Results of both approaches are presented in Table ", "1", ", including measured Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface areas, total pore volume, and pore size distributions obtained using two different empirical models. Calculated structural properties are also given there.", "Considering the experimental approach first, we obtained pore diameters from pore size distributions computed using the Dubinin\u2013Astakhov (DA)", "(62)", " and Saito\u2013Foley (SF)", "(79)", " models, two semiempirical methods commonly used to characterize MOFs. For the MOF-74-", "x", " series, the DA model yields pore diameters for the Co- and Zn-containing structures of 10.2 and 13.2 \u00c5, respectively, whereas the SF model yields an 11 \u00c5 pore diameter for both. These values bracket the 11.74 \u00c5 distance obtained from the crystal structure between equivalent atoms on opposite sides of the pore (including van der Waals radii). However, for the copper paddlewheel structures, the pore dimensions obtained from the two models are conflicting. The MOF with the largest pores is the same in both cases (NOTT-102), but beyond that there is no systematic trend. Moreover, in some cases the values are quite different (e.g., compare NOTT-101, -102, and -103).", "Although these inconsistencies may be due in part to partial pore collapse and/or residual reactant (see discussion below), it more likely that the primary cause is the fact that the pores in ", "nbo", "-MOFs are not simple geometrical shapes. Even the relatively uniform structure of HKUST-1 pores is complicated by the presence of two different pores. Pore landscapes predicted by the Zeo++ code demonstrate this, as seen in ", "Figures S36\u2013S42", ". HKUST-1, NOTT-100, NOTT-103, and PCN-14 each have one 3D channel system. NOTT-102 is more complex, having one 1D channel system that zigzags through the unit cell. In contrast, NOTT-101 has two independent channel systems, each being 1D and zigzagging through the unit cell. Finally, MOF-74-Mg has a single 1D channel system.", "These results suggest that our second approach for evaluating pore dimensions, computational methods, will be more useful for correlating pore structure with gas uptake. Again using the Zeo++ code, we obtain the ranked order of LCDs, from smallest to largest: NOTT-100 < PCN-14 \u223c NOTT-101 < NOTT-103 \u223c NOTT-102 < HKUST-1. For NOTT-101 to 103, the PLD computed by the Zeo++ method corresponds to tortuous, zigzag diffusion pathways, as shown in ", "Figures S46\u2013S48", ". Clearly, visualizing pores or measuring their diameters along uniaxial directions will not necessarily identify the true PLD. The PSDs obtained from the Zeo++ code (", "Figures S43\u2013S49", ") confirm this notion, showing that the NOTT MOFs have multiple pore sizes; thus, a single LCD descriptor does not fully capture the characteristics of the porosity. In the following discussion, we use the LCD ordering as a guide to establishing correlations between gas uptake data measured experimentally and predicted by GCMC calculations.", "Comparing our measured BET surface areas and total pore volumes with previously reported values indicates generally good agreement. However, the BET surface areas we obtain for all MOFs included in our test set are significantly lower than computed values. Since the Zeo++ structural parameters are geometry based, they characterize only the aspects of the MOF related to the crystal structure. In contrast, measured properties such as surface area are also influenced by the nature of the gas\u2013MOF interaction, so an exact match between the Zeo++ results and experiments is not expected, although trends should be accurately captured. Nevertheless, our experimental values for the MOF-74-", "x", " series are significantly higher than those reported previously.", "(80)", "The likely reason is the more effective washing cycle employed here, in which unreacted starting materials and/or unwanted byproducts of the synthesis are removed more effectively from the large channels of the MOF.

However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.

The synthesis of a few elec. conducting MOFs and their known structural flexibility suggest that MOF-based electronic devices exploiting these properties could be constructed.  It is clear, however, that new fabrication methods are required to take advantage of the unique properties of MOFs and extend their use to the realms of electronic circuitry.  In this Concepts article, the authors describe the basic functional elements needed to fabricate electronic devices and summarize the current state of relevant MOF research, and then review recent work in which MOFs serve as active components in electronic devices.

A series of porous samples has been obtained by using an off-lattice 3D reconstruction method recently introduced to reproduce topol. and morphol. properties of correlated disordered porous materials such as Vycor.  The off-lattice functional of 115 m2 g-1 Vycor is applied to a simulation box contg. silicon and oxygen atoms of cubic cristoballite with a homothetic redn. in order to obtain porous samples with mean pore size around 35 \u00c5 and sp. surface around 220 m2 g-1.

Some topol. properties of the different 3D reconstructions of the Vycor-like material are analyzed using chord length distributions and small angle scattering data.  The GCMC Ar, Kr and Xe adsorption/desorption isotherms are calcd. at different temps.  At sufficiently low temps., they exhibit a capillary condensation transition with an adsorption branch having a finite slope accompanied by a hysteresis loop upon desorption.  It has been shown on a set of simulated argon isotherms, that evolution with temp. of the GCMC results is similar to expt.  At the temp. at which the hysteresis loop disappears, it was found that the compressibility of the dense liq.-like phase at the max. of the so-called hysteretic coexistence curves increases significantly.

The heat of adsorption is an important thermodn. quantity that can be measured both in expts. and mol. simulations, and therefore it is often used to study the quality of a force field for a certain guest-host (g-h) system.  In mol. simulations, the heat of adsorption in zeolites is often computed using either of the following methods: (1) using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which requires the partial deriv. of the pressure with respect to temp. at const. loading, (2) using the energy difference between the host with and without a single guest mol. present, and (3) from energy/particle fluctuations in the grand-canonical ensemble.  To calc. the heat of adsorption from expts. (besides direct calorimetry), only the 1st method is usually applicable.  Although the computation of the heat of adsorption is straightforward for all-SiO2 zeolites, severe difficulties arise when applying the conventional methods to systems with nonframework cations present.  The reason for this is that these nonframework cations have very strong Coulombic interactions with the zeolite.  The authors will present an alternative method based on biased interactions of guest mols. that suffers less from these difficulties.  This method requires only a single simulation of the host structure.  The authors will review some of the other important issues concerning the handling of these strong Coulombic interactions in simulating the adsorption of guest mols.

The slit model provides a pore size of 0.45 nm, while the new cylindrical models provide values of 0.69 and 0.74 nm.

Adsorptive sepn. is very important in industry.  Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents.  With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas sepn., adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-contg. nodes connected by org. bridges, are such a new type of porous materials.  They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas sepns. due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability.  This crit. review starts with a brief introduction to gas sepn. and purifn. based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs.  Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions obsd. in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed.  As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable mol. sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated.  In addn. to the exptl. aspect, theor. investigations from adsorption equil. to diffusion dynamics via mol. simulations are also briefly reviewed.  Furthermore, gas sepns. in MOFs, including the mol. sieving effect, kinetic sepn., the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 sepn., and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXkvVamurY%253D&md5=cbb650af8ce92526fc8ffd870218bbd0", "87.

Our technique is based on material informatics (i.e., diversity selection, similarity searching and docking), and it selects promising candidate materials by identifying substructural features that dominate phys. properties of interest and screening for them efficiently within a database.  Our screening approach is novel in that it is based on local structural features, allowing us to identify outstanding adsorption materials based on their specific guest-binding sites.  We have demonstrated this using computationally inexpensive method by screening a database of about one million zeolites for structures for the adsorption-based sepn. of CO2/N2 mixts., and have shown that many of the strongest CO2 adsorbing structures in a dataset can be identified over 65 times more efficiently than through brute-force methods.
