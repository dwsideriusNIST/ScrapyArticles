Spectroscopic results suggest that Ca-BDC(150) contains either two separate phases or two types of domains within the crystals. Because the prolonged heating time at 150 \u00b0C did not enhance the removal of DMF, the occurrence of different domains in one crystal is more probable. At 150 \u00b0C, a slight framework rearrangement seems to occur, because of which only water molecules can completely desorb from the channels. DMF molecules with larger kinetic diameter and lower mobility than water diffuse more slowly. Partial structural changes of Ca(BDC)(DMF)(H", "2", "O) that occur at 150 \u00b0C seem to block the channels within the material and allow only the desorption of the DMF molecules, which are on or close to the surface of the crystals. The rest of the free DMF molecules remain trapped within the blocked channels and only after the next structural rearrangement at 400 \u00b0C does desorption of the remaining DMF occur.

Phase transitions at 150, 400, and 550 \u00b0C are in accordance with weight losses observed by TG measurements. An attempt to determine the crystal structure of Ca-BDC(150) failed because the reflections in XRD pattern could not be indexed with the proper reliability due to the presence of different domains. The diffraction pattern of Ca-BDC(150) namely shows the reflections corresponding to Ca-BDC(RT), which are shifted toward higher angles, and also the reflections belonging to Ca-BDC(400). As already proposed, the outer domains of the crystals, where DMF is initially removed, are most probably transformed to the Ca-BDC(400) phase, which will be described later in the text. The cores of the crystals, where DMF is still trapped within the structure, seem to be subjected to only minor framework rearrangement. As indicated by the shifting of the corresponding XRD reflections, the rhombic-shaped channels contract along one direction and expand along the other; however, the presence of free DMF molecules within the channels prevents substantial channel subsiding and complete transformation to the Ca-BDC(400) phase.

In the current work, the authors chose ZIF-7 as a promising candidate for the development of a H2-selective membrane.  ZIF-7 is formed by bridging benzimidazolate anions and zinc cations with soladite (SOD) topol.  The pore size of ZIF-7 (the hexagonal window size in the SOD cage) estd. from crystallog. data is \u223c0.3 nm, which is just in between the size of H2 (0.29 nm) and CO2 (0.33 nm).  A ZIF-7 membrane could therefore be expected to display a high selectivity of H2 over CO2 and other gases through a mol. sieving effect.  The ultramicroporous zeolitic imidazolate framework, ZIF-7, was tested for its gas-sepn. properties in membrane applications by synthesizing it on a porous alumina support using a microwave-assisted secondary growth technique.  In terms of H2 sepn., the ZIF-7 membrane has several advantages: (1) its pore dimension approaches the size of H2, therefore a high H2 selectivity could be obtained without any sophisticated pore-size engineering; (2) it is thermally stable for use up to at least 500\u00b0C in air; and (3)its hydrophobicity endows it with very good hydrothermal stability.  The present work also demonstrates a general approach towards the fabrication of high-quality MOF membranes on ceramic supports: polymers with coordination abilities such as PEI in current work, which can be used to aid the seeding procedure, and fast microwave synthesis, which is superior for reducing the membrane thickness.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXktlansg%253D%253D&md5=be6db119b89094408a334658f1b24139", "8.

Based on MOF-5 a new synthetic route was developed which allows the partial substitution of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate (BDC) linkers in the material by functionalized 2-aminobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate.  In that way the no. of catalytically active amino groups can be tuned using the desired BDC/ABDC ratio.  The presence of MIXMOFs (instead of a mech. mixt. of MOF-5 and IRMOF-3) was proven by high-resoln. x-ray diffraction and DTG.  X-ray diffraction and TG/MS anal. revealed that pure MIXMOF materials can be obtained up to an ABDC loading of 40 %.  The thermal stability in air is decreasing with increasing ABDC content from 450 \u00b0C for pure MOF-5 (0 % ABDC) to ca. 350 \u00b0C for the 40 % MIXMOF Zn4O(BDC)1.8(ABDC)1.2.  Consequently, MIXMOF materials represent a promising class of materials for catalytic applications at least up to 300 \u00b0C which is proven using the synthesis of propylene carbonate (PC) from propylene oxide and carbon dioxide as a test reaction.  Solid MIXMOF catalysts in combination with tetraalkylammonium halides (NR4X) as promoters are as active as the corresponding homogeneously dissolved ref. compds. (H2ABDC, H2BDC and Zn salts) and that they can be recycled with only moderate loss in activity.  A comparison of MIXMOFs from 0 to 40 % of ABDC revealed a dependence of activity on the no. of amino groups.  Due to the fact that even pure MOF-5 catalyzed the reaction to some extent, surface Zn centers with free coordination sites might also contribute to substrate activation.  Using optimized reaction conditions, a PC yield of up to 63 % can be obtained after 3 h in the presence of low catalyst concn. (0.045 mol-% of 40 % MIXMOF, contg. 0.05 mol-% of NH2 groups).

The adsorption characteristics of nitrogen, Ar, CO2, nitrous oxide and EtOH and MeOH vapors on Ni2(4,4'-bipyridine)3(NO3)4 were studied over a range of temps. as a function of pressure.  Isotherm steps were obsd. for both CO2 and nitrous oxide adsorption at \u223c10-20% of the total pore vol. and at \u223c70% of total pore vol. for MeOH adsorption.  The adsorption kinetics obey a linear driving force (LDF) mass transfer model for adsorption at low surface coverage.  At high surface coverage, both MeOH and EtOH adsorption follow a combined barrier resistance/diffusion model.  The rates of adsorption in the region of both the CO2 and MeOH isotherm steps were significantly slower than those obsd. either before or after the step.  X-ray diffraction studies at various MeOH loadings showed that the host structure disordered initially but underwent a structural change in the region of the isotherm step.  These isotherm steps are ascribed to discrete structural changes in the host adsorbent that are induced by adsorption on different sites.  Isotherm steps were not obsd. for EtOH adsorption, which followed a Langmuir isotherm.  Previous x-ray crystallog. studies showed that all the sites are equiv. for EtOH adsorption on Ni2(4,4'-bipyridine)3(NO3)4, with the host structure undergoing a scissoring motion and the space group remaining unchanged during adsorption.  The activation energies and preexponential factors for MeOH and EtOH adsorption were calcd. for each pressure increment at which the linear driving force model was obeyed.  There was a good correlation between activation energy and ln(preexponential factor), indicating a compensation effect.  The results are discussed in terms of reversible adsorbate/adsorbent (guest/host) structural changes and interactions and the adsorption mechanism.

Two samples, with \u223c100% and \u223c35% of the sorption sites in the channels occupied by benzene, were studied with single-crystal XRD at 173 K.  In the fully occupied sample, the benzene mols. are located in the alternating broader and narrower wide portions of the channels, and these sites are populated nearly equally, producing dense 1-dimensional packing of the guest mols. along the channel.  The mols. in the broader channel site are almost perpendicular to the channel axis (.perp.), while the mols. in the narrower channel site are almost aligned along the channel (\u2016) with their thermal parameters about twice as large.  In the sample with 35% occupancy, the benzenes have thermal parameters that are twice those in the fully occupied sample and are distributed over .perp. and \u2016 sites in about a 1:2 ratio, suggesting an energetic preference for the smaller site.  2H NMR spectra of C6D6 were obtained for the 100% occupancy sample as a function of temp.  The lines are skewed slightly by paramagnetic interactions with the CuII centers.  Line shape anal. indicated a sequence of 3 types of benzene motion with increasing temp.: there is already rapid in-plane motion at 77 K, followed at slightly higher temps. by the onset of 2-site jumps between the .perp. and \u2016 orientations.  Before this reaches the fast motion limit, the onset of reorientation about the 3-fold axis of the channel commences in the 175 K region.  At room temp. all of these dynamic processes are rapid, as they are for samples with lower benzene loadings, but in these cases the reduced .perp.:\u2016 ratio results in progressive line narrowing.

The large unit cells, the enormous flexibility and variation in structural motifs of MOFs represent a big challenge in the characterization of MOF materials, particularly in cases where single crystal diffraction data are not available.  In this crit. review in cases where only powder diffraction data are available addnl. structural information, particularly regarding local coordination within the inorg. cluster, are often mandatory to solve the structure.  There are also cases where the inorg. cluster does not follow the symmetry of the overall structure.  In such cases diffraction techniques will just see an av. structure, missing the local structure: a lack that may be crit. for understanding the specific properties of the material.  In both cases, EXAFS spectroscopy is the tool that provides complementary structural information on the inorg. cluster and the way it binds to the ligand.  Selected examples will show how EXAFS will be relevant in: (i) confirming the structure obtained from diffraction refinements; (ii) highlighting that the inorg. cornerstone has a lower symmetry with respect to that of the org. framework; (iii) obtaining the local structure of the inorg. cluster in the desolvated material when desolvation causes a partial loss of long range order; (iv) obtaining the local structure of the inorg. cluster in the desolvated material after coordination of a probe (or reactant) mol., including cluster deformation upon mol. coordination and metal-mol. binding distance; (v) evidencing the presence of impurities as amorphous extra-phases (339 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhsVejsLzO&md5=24b534ae727e28744f038b2c09e8d9c0"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpccck/2013/jpccck.2013.117.issue-15/jp311529e/production/images/small/jp-2012-11529e_0012.gif\">"]}
