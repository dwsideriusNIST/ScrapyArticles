Two types of binding sites for Na+ ions are identified in the framework.  Site I is in the single eight-membered ring, whereas site II is in the \u03b1-cage. Na+ ions at site I have a stronger affinity for the framework and thus a smaller mobility.  The binding sites in rho-ZMOF resemble those in its inorg. counterpart rho-zeolite. CO2 is adsorbed predominantly over other gases because of its strong electrostatic interactions with the charged framework and the presence of Na+ ions acting as addnl. adsorption sites.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.

Their adsorption capacities, however, have remained insufficient for practical applications, and thus strategies to enhance hydrogen-MOF interactions are required.  An anionic MOF material built from In(III) centers and tetracarboxylic acid ligands (H4L) in which kinetic trapping behavior - where hydrogen is adsorbed at high pressures but not released immediately on lowering the pressure - is modulated by guest cations.  With piperazinium dications in its pores, the framework exhibits hysteretic adsorption.  On exchange of these dications with lithium cations, no hysteresis is seen, but instead there is an enhanced adsorption capacity coupled with an increase in the isosteric heat of adsorption.  This is rationalized by the different locations of the cations within the pores, detd. with precision by X-ray crystallog.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1MXhtVegsr3E&md5=c8840d0355fddc918e5d399229c4a953", "22.
