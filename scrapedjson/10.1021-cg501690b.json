In its perfect crystal structure, each Zr metal center is fully coordinated by 12 org. linkers to form a highly connected framework.  Using high-resoln. neutron power diffraction technique, we found the first direct structural evidence showing that real UiO-66 material contains significant amt. of missing-linker defects, an unusual phenomenon for MOFs.  The concn. of the missing-linker defects is surprisingly high, \u223c10% in our sample, effectively reducing the framework connection from 12 to \u223c11.  We show that by varying the concn. of the acetic acid modulator and the synthesis time, the linker vacancies can be tuned systematically, leading to dramatically enhanced porosity.  We obtained samples with pore vols. ranging from 0.44 to 1.0 cm3/g and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas ranging from 1000 to 1600 m2/g, the largest values of which are \u223c150% and \u223c60% higher than the theor. values of defect-free UiO-66 crystal, resp.  The linker vacancies also have profound effects on the gas adsorption behaviors of UiO-66, in particular CO2.  Finally, comparing the gas adsorption of hydroxylated and dehydroxylated UiO-66, we found that the former performs systematically better than the latter (particularly for CO2) suggesting the beneficial effect of the -OH groups.  This finding is of great importance because hydroxylated UiO-66 is the practically more relevant, non-air-sensitive form of this MOF.  The preferred gas adsorption on the metal center was confirmed by neutron diffraction measurements, and the gas binding strength enhancement by the -OH group was further supported by our first-principles calcns.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhtValsLrL&md5=c1ead8cbafaae77968f37490e2bb14f6", "6.

The structure consists of corrugated chains of corner-sharing AlO4F2 octahedra in which alternating AlO4F2 octahedra contain 2 fluorine atoms in a trans or a cis configuration.  The diphosphonate groups link the chains together through Al-O-P-O-Al bridges and through the propylene groups to form a 3-dimensional framework structure contg. a 1-dimensional channel system.  The linkage of the corrugated inorg. Al-O-P layers within the structure gave 2 types of channel that differ in size, shape and compn.

A computational study into the driving force that controls the stacking arrangement of the Al-O-P inorg. layers within this series of compds. reveals that the stacking is controlled by thermodn. factors, arising chiefly from the conformation of the org. linker mol. used to connect the inorg. sheets.  The registration of the inorg. layers can be engineered by selecting an appropriate, simple org. spacer or linker alkyl chain, where an even no. of C atoms in the alkyl chain directs formation of aligned, stacked, inorg. sheets (AAAAAA), and an odd no. directs formation of unaligned, stacked sheets (ABABAB) and the formation of one or 2 channel types in the resultant structure, resp.  This combination of alkyl-chain linkers in conjunction with corrugated inorg. layers is an effective tool to rationally design the pore system of hybrid framework materials.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2cXlvVKhsrk%253D&md5=f9b06c57322e7ae114b3d7f0b707f2f2", "43.
