This ideal system provides a ref. system with which to compare the behavior of water and ions in real porous materials such as zeolites, bucky tubes, and biol. channels.  In channels of radii between 2.5 and 5.5 \u00c5 the water mols. form a cylindrical solvation shell inside the channel walls with some evidence of a second shell in the center of the largest channel.  Not all protons are involved in hydrogen bonding and a no. point toward the walls.  The authors attribute this to the concavity of the surface.  When a sodium ion is added it tends to lie in the center of the channel where it can form the most complete solvation shell.  Its diffusion rate decreases in smaller channels until it moves too slowly in a channel of 2 \u00c5 radius to be detected in the present simulations.  This decrease is only partly due to an increase in the mean square force on the ion.  A range of ions of different sizes were studied in a channel with radius 3 \u00c5.  While the smaller of these ions (F-, Na+, and Ca++) lie preferentially in the center of the channel, larger ions (Cl-, I-, and Cs+) penetrate some way into the layer of water inside the wall and methane and ions with the charges turned off move next to the wall.  Landau free energy anal. shows that this change is due to the balance between entropy and energy.  The behavior in smooth channels is quite the opposite of what has been obsd. in exptl. studies and simulations of Gramicidin (pore radius of 2 \u00c5), where Cs+ lies closer to the center of the channel and Na+ lies off the axis.  This difference can be attributed to the specific mol. structure of the gramicidin pores (e.g., the presence of carbonyl groups).  As in bulk solns., the mobilities of the ions in smooth channels increase to a max. with ion size and decrease with increasing magnitude of the charge on the ion, while uncharged species diffuse much more rapidly and show a monotonic decrease with size.  This behavior is related to the characteristics of the fluctuations of the forces on the solute mols.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK28XntF2ns7g%253D&md5=2e3d18872639c2f657195a33eb13d231", " ", " ", "(17)", "\u2002", "Sanson, M.

Here the authors report mol. dynamics simulations showing spontaneous and continuous filling of a nonpolar carbon nanotube with a 1-dimensionally ordered chain of water mols.  Although the mols. forming the chain are in chem. and thermal equil. with the surrounding bath, the authors observe pulse-like transmission of water through the nanotube.  These transmission bursts result from the tight hydrogen-bonding network inside the tube, which ensures that d. fluctuations in the surrounding bath lead to concerted and rapid motion along the tube axis.  Also a minute redn. in the attraction between the tube wall and water dramatically affects pore hydration, leading to sharp, two-state transitions between empty and filled states on a nanosecond timescale.

Adsorption of water on carbons dried at 175 \u00b0C in N2 generates typical Type V adsorption isotherms.  Heat of adsorption data for water adsorbed on dried carbon indicates that condensation accounts for the sharp rise in adsorption at a relative humidity of approx. 0.5.  Treating carbons with N2 at 950 \u00b0C generates surfaces that initially adsorb water through a mechanism of chem. adsorption, followed by condensation, and finally phys. adsorption.  On high-temp. N2-treated carbons heats of adsorption exceed 100 kcal/mol, suggesting chemisorption of water at unsatd. carbon surface sites produced during the high-temp. redn. of oxygen species.  Carbons reduced with H2 at 950 \u00b0C are hydrophobic, and microcalorimetric data reveals that the small amt. of adsorption obsd. arises from either chem. or phys. adsorption rather than condensation.

This sorption is of the phys. type occasioned by the development of mutual polarization of adjacent sorbed mols.  It is concluded that H2O is adsorbed or persorbed as a 2-dimensional liquid film permeating the structure of the charcoal.  These observations agree with measurements of the d. and sp. heat of the sorbed H2O.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaA3sXktlWrtQ%253D%253D&md5=1f47a8d796cdabf2d154d81a1938bebe", " ", " "], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/2004/jpcbfk.2004.108.issue-39/jp048323v/production/images/small/jp048323vf00011.gif\">"]}
