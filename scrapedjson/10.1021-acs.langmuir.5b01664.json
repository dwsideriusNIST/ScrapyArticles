This is typically a bad indicator because the model is physically inadequate if the results differ for the more generally applicable and accurate BSS and BSSP models (see below). This does, however, suggest that the H", "2", " sorption observables in this MOF can be captured by considering only van der Waals interactions, at least if the agreement persists at temperatures other than 77 K. Simulations using the BSS and BSSP models generated isotherms that are only slightly higher than the experimental isotherm and the isotherm produced by the Buch model at 77 K, especially at pressures from 0.05 atm (38 mmHg) and above. The slight oversorption for the BSS and BSSP models compared to experiment for nearly all pressures considered at 77 K could be because a perfect crystal of the MOF was used for the simulations. Actual synthesized crystals could have minor deformations, and such alterations are likely to result in partially blocked pores for MOFs that have very narrow pore sizes.

Indeed, H", "2", " sorption in [Zn(trz)(tftph)] is dominated by van der Waals (repulsion/dispersion) interactions because of the small pores that are present in the framework. Smaller pores would allow the H", "2", " molecules to interact with multiple portions of the framework simultaneously,", "(30)", " thus causing van der Waals interactions to dominate. This was confirmed by examining the energy decomposition for each model, as it was revealed that Lennard-Jones interactions contribute to at least 90% of the total energy for the BSS and BSSP models for all state points considered. In addition, the fact that the BSS and BSSP models produced essentially the same isotherm in [Zn(trz)(tftph)] indicates that polarization interactions are insignificant for H", "2", " sorption in this MOF. Although polarization has been shown to be important for simulations of H", "2", " sorption in MOFs that contain open-metal sites,", "(27, 38, 50, 51)", " these interactions are negligible in MOFs that contain narrow pore sizes and exclude such metal centers. Apparently, the negatively charged constituents like the fluorine atoms in this MOF do not participate significantly in such interactions as well.", "(31)", "It can be observed in Figure ", "2", "a that the Buch model undersorbs the experimental isotherm in [Zn(trz)(tftph)] at 87 K for all pressures considered. As for the BSS and BSSP models, these potentials produced isotherms that are in good agreement with experiment at 87 K for pressures up to 0.60 atm (456 mmHg). At higher pressures at 87 K, however, both models undersorb experiment, with the largest difference between experiment and simulation being observed at nearly 1.2 atm (912 mmHg). The isotherms generated by all three models do not capture the shape of the experimental isotherm at 87 K particularly well. The simulated isotherms at 87 K are essentially a scaled version of those generated at 77 K as typically seen in analogous experiments over this relatively cold and narrow temperature range. Such shape differences usually indicate a structural differentiation in either sorbate binding or MOF structure that are not especially likely in this case. The difference in the shape of the 87 K sorption isotherm between experiment and simulation reflects the fact that the H", "2", " uptake is trending toward saturation in the MOF more quickly under experimental conditions at this temperature. Despite this difference, we believe that the simulated results (considering all models) are in reasonable agreement with experiment at 87 K for all pressures considered.", "Because of the small surface area of [Zn(trz)(tftph)] (Langmuir value is 100 m", "2", " g", "\u20131", "),", "(33)", " the experimental H", "2", " uptake in this MOF can only reach about 43 cm", "3", " g", "\u20131", " (1.92 mmol g", "\u20131", " or 0.39 wt %) at 77 K and 1.0 atm.

However, the sharp increase in the experimental isotherm at low loadings at both 77 and 87 K suggests a high initial H", "2", " ", "Q", "st", " value in this MOF. Indeed, as shown in Figure ", "2", "b, the experimental H", "2", " ", "Q", "st", " value for [Zn(trz)(tftph)] starts at around 8.0 kJ mol", "\u20131", ", and it decreases slightly with increasing loading where it reaches a value of about 6.5 kJ mol", "\u20131", " at roughly 30 cm", "3", " g", "\u20131", " (1.34 mmol g", "\u20131", " or 0.27 wt %). It will be shown later that this high initial H", "2", " ", "Q", "st", " value for [Zn(trz)(tftph)] is attributed to sorption at a highly favorable binding site in the MOF as a result of the small pore sizes. As stated in ref ", "33", ", this ", "Q", "st", " plot was obtained through a finite difference approximation to the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation.", "(52)", "The calculated ", "Q", "st", " values for the three different H", "2", " potentials in [Zn(trz)(tftph)], as determined through GCMC simulation, are shown in Figure ", "2", "b with the experimental ", "Q", "st", " plot.

Both the BSS and BSSP models produce ", "Q", "st", " values that are very similar to each other across the loading range in this MOF. This further indicates that polarization interactions contribute minimally to the H", "2", " sorption energetics in this MOF. In addition, this is consistent with what was observed in the simulated isotherms for these two potentials (Figure ", "2", "a).", "While the experimental ", "Q", "st", " plot shows slightly decreasing values as a function of uptake, the simulated ", "Q", "st", " values for all three models are relatively constant for the loading range considered. Thus, the simulations suggest homogeneity in the binding sites for H", "2", " sorption in [Zn(trz)(tftph)], at least for uptakes up to 40 cm", "3", " g", "\u20131", ". Although this is mostly consistent with the experimental ", "Q", "st", " plot when looking at the values at low loadings, a noticeable decrease can be observed in the plot starting at around 22.5 cm", "3", " g", "\u20131", ". Hence, a different shape is captured in the experimental ", "Q", "st", " plot at high loadings. The difference in the shape in the ", "Q", "st", " plots between experiment and simulation could be due to the difference in the methodology used to extract the ", "Q", "st", " values for the respective techniques. As stated earlier, the experimental ", "Q", "st", " values are calculated through a finite difference approximation to the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation, which is dependent on the fitting parameters used to evaluate the required derivatives.

Further calculations and inspection of the modeled structure for H", "2", " in [Zn(trz)(tftph)] reveal that the sorption site that is associated with the 6.2 meV peak does not correspond to a new sorption site outside of those shown in Figure ", "3", " but rather to a slightly shifted version of a H", "2", " molecule that is sorbed at the primary site in the MOF. Indeed, it can be deduced from the spectra that the 6.2 meV peak represents a shifted version of the 5.4 meV peak, that is, the peak at 6.2 meV shifts to lower energies (to 5.4 meV) at higher loadings.

We reveal that, in this system, the major contribution to the overall binding comes from the classical Coulomb interaction which is not screened due to the open metal site; this explains the relatively high binding energies and short H2-metal distances obsd. in MOFs with exposed metal sites as compared to traditional ones.  Despite the short distances, there is no indication of an elongation of the H-H bond for the bound H2 mol. at the metal site.  We find that both the phonon and rotational energy levels of the hydrogen mol. are closely similar, making the interpretation of the inelastic neutron scattering data difficult.  Finally, we show that the orientation of H2 has a surprisingly large effect on the binding potential, reducing the classical binding energy by almost 30%.

Previous modeling studies have shown that these interactions are not adequately modeled when literature force-field parameters are used.  Typical results of grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations exhibit a pronounced underestimation of the hydrogen uptake at low pressures and low temps.  In this study, it is shown that this shortcoming can be resolved by deriving a new set of potential parameters to represent the metal-dihydrogen interaction from ab initio calcns. for mol. model systems.  The approach is computationally efficient and could be applied for any coordination environment of the metal center.  The present work focuses on three MOFs with unsatd. copper centers.  The newly derived Cu-H2 potential model is combined with literature force-field parameters to model the dispersive interactions with other framework atoms.  At cryogenic temps. and pressures up to 1 bar, GCMC simulations using these parameters provide for a massively improved prediction of the hydrogen storage characteristics when compared to parameters from a literature force field.  On the other hand, the unmodified literature parameters perform best in predicting the satn. uptake.  At room temp., the effect of the potential modification is much smaller, and the best agreement with expt. is obtained when the localized metal-dihydrogen interaction is not accounted for in the simulations.  This indicates that the metal-dihydrogen interaction is too weak to permit a significant adsorption at the metal sites under these conditions.  Calcns. using an artificially enhanced potential model show that a drastic increase of the interaction strength could boost the hydrogen storage capacity at room temp., although the attainable uptake remains limited by the no. of available metal sites.

Calcd. hydrogen uptake isotherms and isosteric heats of adsorption, Qst, were in quant. agreement with expt. only for the model with explicit polarization.  This success in reproducing empirical measurements suggests that modeling MOFs that have open metal sites is feasible, though it is often not considered to be well described via a classical potential function; here it is shown that such systems may be accurately described by explicitly including polarization effects in an otherwise traditional empirical potential.  Decompn. of energy terms for the models revealed deviations between the electrostatic and polarizable results that are unexpected due to just the augmentation of the potential surface by the addn. of induction.  Charge-quadrupole and induction energetics were shown to have a synergistic interaction, with inclusion of the latter resulting in a significant increase in the former.  Induction interactions strongly influence the structure of the sorbed hydrogen compared to the models lacking polarizability; sorbed hydrogen is a dipolar dense fluid in the MOF.

The INS spectrum for H2 in SIFSIX-2-Cu-i is rather unique for a porous material, as only one broad peak appears at low energies near 6 meV, which simply increases in intensity with loading until the pores are filled.  The value for this rotational transition is lower than that in most neutral metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), including those with open Cu sites (8-9 meV), which is indicative of a higher barrier to rotation and stronger interaction in the channels of SIFSIX-2-Cu-i than the open Cu sites in MOFs.  Simulations of H2 sorption in SIFSIX-2-Cu-i revealed 2 H sorption sites in the MOM: direct interaction with the equatorial F atom (site 1) and between 2 equatorial F atoms on opposite walls (site 2).  The calcd. rotational energy levels and rotational barriers for the 2 sites in SIFSIX-2-Cu-i are in good agreement with INS data.

Four distinct hydrogen sorption sites were detd. from the polarization distribution: the nitrate ions located in the corners of the truncated tetrahedral cages, the Cu2+ ions of the paddlewheels that project into the truncated tetrahedral and truncated octahedral cages (Cu1 ions), the Cu2+ ions of the Cu3O trimers (Cu3 ions), and the sides of the paddlewheels in the cuboctahedral cage.  The simulations revealed that the initial sorption sites for hydrogen in rht-MOF-1 are the nitrate ions; this site corresponds to the high initial Qst value for hydrogen (9.5 kJ mol-1) in the MOF.  The radial distribution functions, g(r), about the Cu2+ ions at various loadings revealed that the Cu1 ions are the preferred open-metal sorption sites for hydrogen at low loading, while the Cu3 ions become occupied at higher loadings.  The validation of the aforementioned sorption sites in rht-MOF-1 was confirmed by calcg. the two-dimensional quantum rotational levels about each site and comparing the levels to the transitions that were obsd. in the exptl.

In the (para-D2)3(ortho-D2)10 cluster at 1 K, the three J = 1 mols. form a \"cluster within cluster,\" held together by the anisotropic quadrupole-quadrupole interactions.  At 3 K the three mol. J = 1 cluster is dissolved within the (D2)13 cluster.  The orientational structure of the (para-D2)13 cluster at 1 K is composed of two distinct distorted-T pair configurations of neighboring J = 1 mols.  Upon heating to 3 K the orientational structure changes, and a clear sepn. between the two pair geometries is no longer obtained.  Moreover at 3 K thermal distortion of the cluster structure form icosahedral relaxes the extent of orientational frustration of the system, and thus contributes to the lowering of the rotational energy.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK2cXjtlWlurw%253D&md5=e28cd8c30b704561f248c349f5cfcf3c", "45.

The MOF is a decorated/substituted isostructural analog to the unembellished rht-MOF, PCN-61, that was studied previously.  The simulations were performed using three different hydrogen potentials of increasing complexity.  Simulated hydrogen sorption isotherms and calcd. isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, values were in excellent agreement with the reported exptl. data for only a polarizable model in one of four exptl. obsd. crystal structure configurations.  The study demonstrates the ability of modeling to distinguish the differential sorption of distinct structures; one configuration is found to be dominant due to favorable interactions with substrates.  In addn., the presence of polar amide groups had a significant effect on the electrostatics of the Cu2+ ions and directs the low-pressure physisorption of hydrogen in the MOF.  This is in contrast to what was obsd. in PCN-61, where an exterior copper ion had a higher relative charge and was the favored loading site.  This tunability of the electrostatics of the copper ions via chem. substitution on the MOF framework can be explained by the presence of the neg. charged oxygen atom of the amide group that causes the interior Cu2+ ion to exhibit a higher pos. charge through an inductive effect.  Further, control simulations, taking advantage of the flexibility afforded by theor. modeling, include artificially modified charges for both Cu2+ ions chosen equal to or with a higher charge on the exterior Cu2+ ion.  This choice resulted in distinctly different hydrogen sorption characteristics in Cu-TPBTM with no direct sorption on the open-metal sites.  Thus, this study demonstrates both the tunable nature of MOF platforms and the possibility for rational design of sorption/catalytic sites and characteristics through the active interplay of theory and expt.

The MOF contains nitrate counterions that are located in carcerand-like capsules of the framework.  This MOF was shown to have a high hydrogen uptake at 77 K and 1.0 atm.  The simulations were performed with a potential that includes explicit many-body polarization interactions, which were important for modeling gas sorption in a charged/polar MOF such as In-soc-MOF.  The simulated hydrogen sorption isotherms were in good agreement with expt. in this challenging platform for modeling.  The simulations predict a high initial isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, value of about 8.5 kJ mol-1, which is in contrast to the exptl. value of 6.5 kJ mol-1 for all loadings.  The difference in the Qst behavior between expt. and simulation is attributed to the fact that, in exptl. measurements, the sorbate mols. cannot access the isolated cages contg. the nitrate ions, the most energetically favorable site in the MOF, at low pressures due to an obsd. diffusion barrier.  In contrast, the simulations were able to capture the sorption of hydrogen onto the nitrate ions at low loading due to the equil. nature of GCMC simulations.  The exptl. Qst values were reproduced in simulation by blocking access to all of the nitrate ions in the MOF.  Furthermore, at 77 K, the sorbed hydrogen mols. were reminiscent of a dense fluid in In-soc-MOF starting at approx. 5.0 atm, and this was verified by monitoring the isothermal compressibility, \u03b2T, values.  The favorable sites for hydrogen sorption were identified from the polarization distribution as the nitrate ions, the In3O trimers, and the azobenzene nitrogen atoms.  Lastly, the two-dimensional quantum rotational levels for a hydrogen mol. sorbed about the aforementioned sites were calcd. and the transitions were in good agreement with those that were obsd. in the exptl. inelastic neutron scattering spectra.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC2MXhsF2hsrk%253D&md5=9fbcb1c05a8ae154cf8ef3eab1d96396", "59.
