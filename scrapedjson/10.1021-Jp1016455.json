To that aim, very simple concepts of chemical bonding can be used to find out the origin of the electrode limitations and to guide experimentalists for the design of new promising materials. This local approach was recently applied to hybrid architectures, such as metal\u2212organic frameworks (MOFs), and allowed some of us to demonstrate the first reversible lithium insertion into the MIL53(Fe) positive electrode. In this paper, we combine first-principles density functional calculations and local chemical bond analyses to fully interpret the redox mechanism of this material. Its reactivity versus elemental lithium is investigated as a function of (i) the lithium composition from ", "Li/Fe = 0\u22121, (ii) the lithium distribution over the most probable Li sites, and (iii) the OH/F substitution ratio along the redox chains. The results show that the MIL53(Fe) is a weak antiferromagnet at ", " = 0 K with iron ions in the high-spin state (Fe", ", ", " = ", "/", "). It reacts with lithium through a two-step insertion/conversion mechanism. The insertion reaction is perfectly reversible and proceeds in two steps: first, a single-phase reaction whose capacity increases linearly with the fluorine content in the starting material, then a two-phase reaction that ends around ", "Li/Fe = 0.5 due to the stabilization of a localized Fe", "/Fe", " mixed-valence state along the inorganic chains. Further lithium insertion into Li", "MIL53(Fe) is shown to provoke an irreversible conversion reaction due to a complete loss of the local interactions between the inorganic and organic networks of the MOF architecture. On the basis of this interpretation, several alternatives to improve the capacity of these materials can be proposed by means of appropriate ligand functionalization and/or use of electrochemically active molecules within the large open space occurring in such porous materials."], "text": ["  ", "Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Computational Details", "Results", "Discussion", "Conclusion", "References", "I Introduction", " ", "Transition-metal oxides and transition-metal phosphates (e.g., LiCoO", "2", ",", "(1)", " LiFePO", "4", "(2-4)", ") are now considered to be the most competitive positive electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. Their relatively high potentials versus lithium offer a wide range of operating voltages from 2.0 to 4.0 V, and their electrochemical reactivity versus Li is generally highly reversible, leading to small voltage hysteresis between the charge and the discharge. Nevertheless, they suffer from rather small capacities associated with the reversible exchange of, at most, one lithium per transition metal during a complete cycle of charge/discharge. This can be partly overcome with conversion reactions,", "(5)", " whereby the starting MO", "y", " oxide fully decomposes into a nanocomposite electrode through the reaction MO", "y", " + 2", "y", "Li \u2192 ", "y", "Li", "2", "O + M", "0", ". However, while these reactions yield a significant increase of capacity compared with insertion reactions (at least twice higher), they exhibit high voltage hysteresis (polarization) between the charge and the discharge that is often thought as a direct consequence of the kinetically limited mass transport accompanying the decomposition/formation of such multiphase electrodes. This raises the question of the feasibility of reaching high capacity and low polarization in transition metal oxides (TM-O) regarding Li-induced electrochemical properties. Using a simple picture of electronic band structure, it is easy to correlate the nature of the electronic states involved in Li redox reactions to the small capacity generally achieved in TM-O. As shown in Figure ", "1", "a, the strong electronegative character of the oxygen ligand with respect to the transition metal leads to TM-O electronic band structures qualitatively described by one low-lying fully occupied band mainly centered on the oxygen 2p orbitals (formally charged O", "2\u2212", " anions) and one high-lying empty or partially filled band mainly centered on the TM 3d orbitals (formally charged M", "n", "+", " cations). From one TM to another, the electronic band structures simply differ by the width of their band gap, which basically depends on the energy difference between the TM 3d and the O 2p orbitals, and by the metallic-band filling that is directly linked to the TM oxidation state and spin configuration. Given a Li-insertion process, the addition of electron(s) into the metallic-like band inevitably generates strong electron\u2212electron repulsions within the TM 3d orbitals, leading to their destabilization in energy. As a direct consequence of these correlation effects, a TM is generally stable in one given oxidation state and one given local environment. To compensate for this destabilization, the system may either undergo a phase transition by stabilizing the TM into a different local environment (modifying its coordination sphere for instance) or accommodate a TM \u2192 O back-donation mechanism to release the TM exceeding charge toward the surrounding ligands. In TM-O, back-donation mechanisms are known to be far less efficient than those in more covalent systems, such as transition-metal phosphides (TM-P) for instance. Indeed, since phosphorus is less electronegative than oxygen, the electronic band structure of TM-P may now be described by two overlapping bands, leading to ligand-type empty levels that are now available and energetically accessible for TM \u2192 P electron transfers (see Figure ", "1", "b). These energetically accessible P levels then provide a reservoir for TMs to release/uptake the exceeding/deficient charge coming along with Li-insertion/extraction. They were shown to be responsible for the high structural stability (stable TM oxidation state and, therefore, stable local environment) and the high capacity (up to 10 Li/TM) of transition-metal phosphides upon Li insertion/extraction.", "(6-8)", " Although such a back-donation mechanism would never lead to TM-O capacities as high as those of TM-P, it can be used as an interesting concept for tuning the electrochemical properties of TM-based compounds by means of an appropriate functionalization of the oxygen ligands. Similar ideas have already been exploited to tune the electrochemical potentials of positive electrodes either by mixing different 3d TM in ternary TM oxides", "(9-11)", " or by functionalizing the oxygen ligands with a series of more or less covalent groups, such as silicates", "(12-15)", " or phosphates,", "(2-4)", " the LiFePO", "4", " being the most famous among the various examples reported so far. In phosphates, the electron density of the oxygen ligand is polarized toward the phosphorus atoms by the so-called \u201cinductive effect\u201d.", "(2)", " From the orbital point of view, this effect can be understood as a \u03c3-acceptor effect of the functionalized ligand. As shown in Figure ", "2", ", the direct consequence of such a ligand functionalization is to decrease the metal\u2212oxygen antibonding character of the metallic-like levels in the redox band, therefore, increasing the electrochemical potential of the redox reaction of FePO", "4", " with lithium. Despite its significant influence on the redox potential, the \u03c3-acceptor effect of the PO", "3", "\u2212", " fragment has a significant, but dramatic, impact on the electron localization on the TM redox center. Indeed, the hybridization of the oxygen 2p orbitals toward the phosphorus coordination sphere lowers the metal\u2212ligand orbital interaction, thus hampering the TM-to-ligand back-donation mechanism required to decrease the electron correlation on the TM. It is, therefore, unlikely that phosphate\u2019s theoretical capacities could be significantly increased with respect to their homologous oxides. Seeking for systems in which such a TM-to-ligand back-donation mechanism could take place, it was tempting to check the effect of a \u03c0-acceptor functionalized ligand onto the electrochemical performances of TM-O derivatives. The use of \u03c0-unsaturated ligands, such as the benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate (BDC", "2\u2212", " = {O", "2", "C\u2212C", "6", "H", "4", "\u2212CO", "2", "}", "2\u2212", "), was then thought as a possible route to relax both the electron correlation on the TM and the local structural distortions expected to occur when the TM is reduced by Li redox processes. As shown in Figure ", "3", ", \u03c0-unsaturated ligands have the appropriate orbital symmetry (when linearly bonded to MO", "6", ") to interact with the t", "2g", "-like orbitals of a MO", "6", " octahedron and to allow for the desired back-donation mechanism to occur. Among the existing materials offering such ligand functionalization of the MO", "6", " units, metal\u2212organic frameworks (MOFs) rapidly appeared as appropriate candidates. These porous materials are functional materials commonly used in sensing, catalysis, ion exchange, separations, or gas storage.", "(16-22)", " They contain inorganic and organic networks that can be easily functionalized to get tunable properties. Among them, the iron-based Fe(OH)", "1\u2212", "y", "F", "y", "(BDC) (BDC = O", "2", "C\u2212C", "6", "H", "4", "\u2212CO", "2", ") compounds, hereafter referred to as MIL53(Fe)-F", "y", ", were recently tested as cathode materials in a Li-ion battery half-cell by Tarascon and co-workers.", "(23)", " The electrochemical activity of the tested MIL53(Fe)-F", "y", " electrodes (", "y", " = 0 and 0.2) with respect to elemental lithium shows interesting performances, such as a good cycling life and rate capability but a disappointing capacity associated with the exchange of \u223c0.4 Li/Fe (", "y", " = 0) and \u223c0.6 Li/Fe (", "y", " = 0.2). These first attempts were, nevertheless, encouraging because they have demonstrated the first reversible lithium insertion into a MOF.

Although promising electrode systems have recently been proposed, their lifespans are limited by Li-alloying agglomeration or the growth of passivation layers, which prevent the fully reversible insertion of Li ions into the negative electrodes.

The mechanism of Li reactivity differs from the classical Li insertion/deinsertion or Li-alloying processes, and involves the formation and decomposition of Li2O, accompanying the reduction and oxidation of metal nanoparticles (in the range 1-5 nanometres) respectively.
