It also details the requirements that MOFs need to satisfy for biomedical application, such as toxicol. compatibility, stability, particle size, and surface modification.  In addn., several approaches used to enhance encapsulation efficiency are summarized and parameters influencing delivery efficiency are also discussed.

Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), a class of hybrid materials formed by the self-assembly of polydentate bridging ligands and metal-connecting points, were studied for a variety of applications.  Recently, these materials were scaled down to nanometer sizes, and this Account details the development of nanoscale metal-org. frameworks (NMOFs) for biomedical applications.  NMOFs possess several potential advantages over conventional nanomedicines such as their structural and chem. diversity, their high loading capacity, and their intrinsic biodegradability.  Under relatively mild conditions, NMOFs can be obtained as either cryst. or amorphous materials.  The particle compn., size, and morphol. can be easily tuned to optimize the final particle properties.  Researchers have employed 2 general strategies to deliver active agents using NMOFs: by incorporating active agents into the frameworks or by loading active agents into the pores and channels of the NMOFs.  The modification of NMOF surfaces with either silica coatings or org. polymers improves NMOF stability, fine-tunes their properties, and imparts addnl. functionality.  Preliminary biomedical applications of NMOFs have focused on their use as delivery vehicles for imaging contrast agents and mol. therapeutics.  Because NMOFs can carry large amts. of paramagnetic metal ions, they were extensively explored as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents.  Both Gd3+- and Mn2+-contg. NMOFs have shown excellent efficacy as T1-weighted contrast agents with large per metal- and per particle-based MR relaxivities.  Fe3+-contg. NMOFs have demonstrated excellent T2-weighted contrast enhancement.  Upon i.v. injection of iron carboxylate NMOFs in Wistar rats, researchers obsd. neg. signal enhancement in the liver and spleen, which dissipated over time, indicating the degrdn. and clearance of the NMOF.  Through the incorporation of luminescent or high Z element building blocks, NMOFs have also served as viable contrast agents for optical imaging or x-ray computed tomog. (CT) imaging.  Incorporation of membrane impermeable dyes into NMOFs allowed for their uptake by cancer cells and for their controlled release as the framework decompd.  NMOFs were used to deliver anticancer drugs and other chemotherapeutics.  Cisplatin prodrugs were incorporated within NMOFs at exceptionally high levels, either through use of the prodrug as the building block or through attachment of the prodrug onto the framework after synthesis.  These NMOFs were encapsulated within a silica shell and targeted to cancer cells.  In vitro assays revealed that the targeted NMOFs possessed similar efficacy to cisplatin, while the nontargeted NMOFs were less active.  Several different therapeutic mols. were loaded within porous iron-carboxylate NMOFs at unprecedented levels.  The NMOF showed sustained drug release with no burst effect, and in vitro assays revealed that the nanoencapsulated drug possessed similar efficacy to the free drug.  Although still at a very early stage of development, NMOFs have already shown great promise as a novel platform for nanomedicine.  The compositional tunability and mild synthetic conditions used to produce NMOFs should allow for the incorporation of other imaging and therapeutic agents and their effective delivery to targeted cells in vivo.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXntFSmsb4%253D&md5=e051a6fe645e7d401d16cfbaa9b1d74c", "7.

Packing of these layers generates 1D nanochannels along the crystallog. a and b axes which host DMF and benzene mols.  In S2B, each L2 ligand participates in hydrogen bonding via an N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interaction between the N-H of the dihydropyridyl ring and the O of a MeOH and also via an N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H-O interaction between the N center of a pyridine ring and the H-O of a second MeOH mol.  The presence of the L2-HOMe hydrogen bonds prevents ligand-ligand hydrogen bonding.  As a result, S2B crystallizes as one-dimensional chains rather than as an extended 3D network.

Values for gravimetric uptake, pore vol., and inverse d. of the MOFs the authors studied scale essentially linearly with surface area.  From this linear dependence, the authors est. that a MOF with surface area 7500 m2/g and pore vol. 3.2 cc/g could reach the current DOE gravimetric target of 0.5 g/g while simultaneously exhibiting around \u223c200 cc/cc volumetric uptake.  While values for volumetric uptake are based on ideal single crystal densities, in reality the packing densities of MOFs are much lower.  Finally, compacting HKUST-1 into wafer shapes partially collapses the framework, decreasing both volumetric and gravimetric uptake significantly.

Using molecular simulations, we uncover the complex interplay of the factors influencing methane adsorption, especially the surface area, the capacity or free volume, the strength of the energetic interaction, and the pore size distribution.  We also explain the extraordinary adsorption properties of IRMOF materials and propose new, not yet synthesized IRMOF structures with adsorption characteristics that are predicted to exceed the best experimental results to date by up to 36%.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD2M3gtFWquw%253D%253D&md5=0f10aca88c4253004548b2ba1dae20b3", "30.

A strength of this approach is that the space of ligands to be explored can be rigorously bounded, allowing discovery of the optimum ligand shape within any criteria, conforming to synthetic requirements or arbitrary exploratory limits.  By modifying these bounds, one can project to what extent achievable surface area increases when moving beyond the present limits of org. synthesis.

H (H2) is a promising alternative energy carrier because of its environmental benefits, high energy d., and abundance.  However, development of a practical storage system to enable the H Economy remains a huge challenge.  Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) are an important class of cryst. coordination polymers constructed by bridging metal centers with org. linkers.  MOFs show promise for H2 storage owing to their high surface area and tuneable properties.  In this Account, the authors summarize the authors' research on novel porous materials with enhanced H2 storage properties and describe frameworks derived from 3,5-substituted dicarboxylates (isophthalates) that serve as versatile mol. building blocks for the construction of a range of interesting coordination polymers with Cu(II) ions.  The authors synthesized materials by connecting linear tetracarboxylate linkers to {Cu(II)2} paddlewheel moieties.  These materials exhibit high structural stability and permanent porosity.  Varying the org. linker modulates the pore size, geometry, and functionality to control the overall H2 adsorption.  The authors' top-performing material in this series has a H2 storage capacity of 77.8 mg g-1 at 77 K, 60 bar.  H2 adsorption at low, medium, and high pressures correlates with the isosteric heat of adsorption, surface area, and pore vol., resp.  Another series, using tribranched C3-sym. hexacarboxylate ligands with Cu(II), gives highly porous (3,24)-connected frameworks incorporating {Cu(II)2} paddlewheels.  Increasing the length of the hexacarboxylate struts directly tunes the porosity of the resultant material from micro- to mesoporosity.  These materials show exceptionally high H2 uptakes owing to their high surface area and pore vol.  The 1st member of this family reported adsorbs 111 mg g-1 of H2, or 55.9 g L-1, at 77 K, 77 bar, while at 77 K, 1 bar, the material adsorbs 2.3 wt. \u0302 H2.  The authors and others have since achieved enhanced H2 adsorption in these frameworks using combinations of polyphenyl groups linked by alkynes.  The max. storage achieved for one of the enhanced materials is 164 mg g-1 at 77 K, 70 bar, but because of its low d., its volumetric capacity is only 45.7 g L-1.  The authors attribute the significant adsorption of H2 at low pressures to the arrangement of the {Cu24(isophthalate)24} cuboctahedral cages within the polyhedral structure.  Free metal coordination positions are the 1st binding sites for D2, and these frameworks have two types of Cu(II) centers, one with its vacant site pointing into the cuboctahedral cage and another pointing externally.  D2 mols. bind 1st at the former position and then at the external open metal sites.  Design of ligands and complexes is key for enhancing and maximizing H2 storage, and although current materials operate at 77 K, research continues to explore routes to high capacity H2 storage materials that can function at higher temps.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3sXhslSgtb%252FI&md5=cc8254d032b3130032ff7577e2a0615e", "37.
