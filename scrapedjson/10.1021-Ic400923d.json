This crit. review will be of interest to the experts in porous solids (including catalysis), but also solid state chemists and physicists.  It presents the state-of-the-art on hybrid porous solids, their advantages, their new routes of synthesis, the structural concepts useful for their 'design', aiming at reaching very large pores.  Their dynamic properties and the possibility of predicting their structure are described.  The large tunability of the pore size leads to unprecedented properties and applications.

This study focuses on these acidic gases and proposes a complete procedure based on an adsorption process for their sepn. from biogas.  In this aim, different measurements are required like pure compd. adsorption isotherms, binary mixt. adsorption equil. and breakthrough curves.  Pure gas isotherms of CH4, CO2 and H2S are realized at 303.15 K on powder and shape (pellet form) industrial MIL-53 (Al), with a gravimetric technique.  We also measure CO2/CH4 adsorption equil. at 303.15 K for two pressures (1 and 4 bar) on pellet form of the adsorbent.  These mixt. data are in good agreement with IAST predictions.  So we can compare the CH4/CO2 and CH4/H2S sepn. performances between powder and pellets.  Although the adsorption capacities are lower for pellets than for powder the sepn. qualities are similar.  After this test, we have concluded that the pellet form of MIL-53 (Al) is a good candidate for CO2 and H2S sepns. from CH4.  According to the selectivity values, the limiting sepn. of the process is the CO2/CH4 one.  So, we have performed exptl. and theor. the breakthrough curve with this binary mixt. and we have concluded that this sepn. is applicable.  Moreover, the simulated and exptl. curves are in good agreement.

Its 3 D framework is built up of infinite trans chains of corner-sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra.  The chains are interconnected by the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate groups, creating 1 D rhombic-shaped tunnels.  Disordered 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid mols. are trapped inside these tunnels.

Discussion focuses on the structural features and luminescent behavior of lanthanide and actinide based coordination polymers and metal-org. framework materials, as well as some synthetic strategies toward producing both homo- and heterometallic compds.  Lanthanide and actinide based coordination polymers and metal-org. framework materials present a no. of interesting opportunities with respect to their syntheses and properties.  Ln elements typically display large coordination nos. and roughly spherical bonding environments whereas An elements (specifically U(VI)) tend to form triat. species with terminal oxo groups.  As such, these features may be perceived by some as obstacles to the development of designed architectures of f-metal contg. hybrid materials.

The compd. was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction, TGA, IR and BET method.  This compd. is isostructural to the MIL-53 type, previously obsd. with the trivalent cations Cr, Fe, Al, In.  It exhibits a three-dimensional metal-org. framework built up from infinite chains of trans corner-sharing GaO4(OH)2 octahedra (via \u03bc2-hydroxo bonds) linked to each other through the terephthalate linkers.

V-O bond lengths to V-O Raman stretching frequencies is presented along with a relation between V-O bond strengths (in valence units) and Raman stretching frequencies.  These empirical correlations lead to a systematic method for detg. the coordination and bond lengths of vanadates.  This method is illustrated for vanadates of known structure (Vanadium n-propoxide, BiVO4, \u03b1-Zn3(VO4)2, and Pb2(VO4)3Cl) and unknown structure (AlVO4 and two-dimensional surface phase in V2O5/Al2O3).  The method is expected to be generally applicable to all vanadates where medium-range order is absent.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK3MXktFGqsrk%253D&md5=bc7ca78ec2a2e67cb20e46478a5398e3"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0011.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0012.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0013.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0014.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0015.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0016.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0017.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2013/inocaj.2013.52.issue-14/ic400923d/production/images/small/ic-2013-00923d_0018.gif\">"]}
