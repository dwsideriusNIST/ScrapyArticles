In this study, we have identified three criteria for achieving high performing porous materials for water adsorption. These criteria deal with condensation pressure of water in the pores, uptake capacity, and recyclability and water stability of the material. In search of an excellently performing porous material, we have studied and compared the water adsorption properties of 23 materials, 20 of which are metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs). Among the MOFs are 10 zirconium(IV) MOFs with a subset of these, MOF-801-SC (single crystal form), \u2212802, \u2212805, \u2212806, \u2212808, \u2212812, and \u2212841 reported for the first time. MOF-801-P (microcrystalline powder form) was reported earlier and studied here for its water adsorption properties. MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized but not examined for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of MOF-841 synthesis. All the new zirconium MOFs are made from the Zr", "O", "(OH)", "(\u2212CO", ")", " secondary building units (", " = 6, 8, 10, or 12) and variously shaped carboxyl organic linkers to make extended porous frameworks. The permanent porosity of all 23 materials was confirmed and their water adsorption measured to reveal that MOF-801-P and MOF-841 are the highest performers based on the three criteria stated above; they are water stable, do not lose capacity after five adsorption/desorption cycles, and are easily regenerated at room temperature. An X-ray single-crystal study and a powder neutron diffraction study reveal the position of the water adsorption sites in MOF-801 and highlight the importance of the intermolecular interaction between adsorbed water molecules within the pores."], "text": ["Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Experimental Section", "Results and Discussion", "Summary", "References", "Introduction", "The adsorption of water by porous solids is important for many applications requiring capture and release of water.

Here, water is adsorbed at night and released during the day, making it possible to deliver fresh water without electric power.", "(2)", " More recently, water capture by porous solids is being investigated in the design of adsorption-driven heat exchangers", "(3)", " for use as air-conditioning units in vehicles (heating and cooling are respectively achieved upon adsorption and desorption of water into/from a porous solid).", "In all such water capture applications, three criteria are prominent in the design of a viable porous material. First, the pore filling or condensation of water into the pores of the solid must occur at low relative pressure (relative humidity) and exhibit a steep uptake behavior. The former is important because water is being captured from media where it is present at low concentrations, and the latter is related to the working capacity of the material. Thus, the water adsorption isotherm should exhibit a steep uptake at a specific relative pressure (", "P", "/", "P", "0", ", where ", "P", "0", " is the saturation pressure of water). For on-board vehicle implementation of heat exchangers (so-called thermal batteries),", "(4)", " water capture is desirable at low relative pressures (", "P", "/", "P", "0", " < 0.1) as it reduces the need to incorporate compressors or to raise the evaporation temperature for the adsorption/desorption cycles. The second criterion is the high water uptake capacity for maximum delivery of water and facile adsorption/desorption processes for energy efficiency. Third, high cycling performance and water stability of the material are required. Hence, porous materials with very large pore size and pore volume might exhibit large uptake capacity that is typically reached only at high relative pressure values (close to saturation) and after a gradual uptake.", "(5)", " Conversely, microporous zeolites can capture water at very low ", "P", "/", "P", "0", " values with steep uptake behavior; however, their recyclability is energetically demanding because of the strong interactions between water and the zeolite framework. There is a need for the design and study of porous materials whose water adsorption behavior meets these three requirements.", "Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have been examined for their water capture properties and they were found to be highly promising materials.", "(6)", " In this study, we show that zirconium MOFs can be designed to meet these three criteria for the first time and exhibit excellent performances as water capture materials.

Subsequently, an activated crystal was exposed to moisture, and a new data set was collected.", "In the structure of MOF-801 there are three symmetry-independent cavities (Figure ", "8", "a), two with tetrahedral shape, hereafter referred to as cavity T1 and cavity T2 (Figure ", "8", "b), and one with octahedral shape (O", "h", ", Figure ", "8", "c). After refinement of the framework atoms we could identify up to three areas of high residual electron density in the tetrahedral pores, which we attributed to the adsorbed water molecules, while the octahedral pores remained empty. These residual electron densities maxima were assigned as oxygen atoms, and their occupancy was refined. Both T1 and T2 cavities clearly demonstrated a primary adsorption site located close to the \u03bc", "3", "-OH groups of the SBUs.", "(32)", " These sites, labeled as site I and II (d and e in Figure ", "8", "), have a refined occupancy of 0.25 and 0.40, respectively.

The third adsorption site, site III, was located only in the interior of cavities T2 (Figure ", "8", "e). The water molecule adsorbed in site III has a refined occupancy of 20%, which is half of the occupancy of the other O atoms in the same cavity (site II). Interestingly, each water molecule in site III would form hydrogen bonds [O\u2013O distance of 2.871(7) \u00c5] with three molecules in site II, resulting in a cubic arrangement of adsorbed water molecules.

With only an inversion center in the unit cell, there are now four crystallographically independent tetrahedral cavities (T1 is split in three) each one of them with unit cell multiplicity 2. In all cases, the same primary adsorption sites I and II are clearly found close to the \u03bc", "3", "-OH groups. They were refined by assigning O atoms with 50% occupancies. In one out of the four tetrahedral cavities, no additional sorption sites were found, while in the other three cavities, electron density areas corresponding to the adsorption sites III were located and assigned to O atoms, resulting in satisfactory refinements. In two of these cavities (splitting from T1), the water clusters are formed by seven atoms, where one atom at a site III is missing in the cube, resulting in an incomplete cubic disposition (Figure ", "8", "f). The occupancies refined were 50% for sites I and II atoms, and 33% for sites III atoms. In the fourth cavity, T2, a complete cubic cluster like the one depicted in Figure ", "8", "e was found, with the eight O atoms refined with 50% occupancy.", "(36)", "The large octahedral cavity was also filled with water molecules. Considering that there is no primary sorption site in the octahedral cavity, it is presumed that the filling process is more or less initiated by the formation of hydrogen bonds with adsorbed water molecules. Indeed, new adsorption sites are identified near the atoms located in the previously described sorption sites III of the tetrahedral cavities and inside the octahedral ones (Figure ", "8", "g).

Structure of MOF-801 consists of three symmetry-independent types of cavities (a), two with tetrahedral shape, T1 and T2 (b), and one with octahedral shape (c). The single-crystal diffraction study of a moisture-exposed crystal (d and e) shows that the water molecules are initially adsorbed in the tetrahedral cavities through hydrogen-bond formation with the SBUs (sites I and II) and among them (sites III). In the crystal exposed to 100% RH, the same arrangements are found, as well as incomplete cubic clusters (f). The octahedral cavities are also filled, and several sorption sites were identified, forming hydrogen bonds with sites III (g). In the microcrystalline MOF-801-P, the neutron diffraction study (h and i) show similar sorption sites I, II, and III, and additional sites, IV and V, at the center of the tetrahedral cavities.", "These observations should reinforce the importance of the cooperative effect in the formation of hydrogen bonds between adsorbed water molecules, which governs the sorption process. Thus, the water molecules are initially adsorbed on the \u03bc", "3", "-OH groups of the Zr-SBU. Following, more water molecules are confined in the cavity by forming new hydrogen bonds with several of the adsorbed molecules at the primary binding sites. Finally, these secondarily adsorbed molecules provide further binding sites to facilitate the adsorption in the larger cavities and subsequent water condensation in the framework of MOF-801-SC.", "6", "Location of Water Molecules in MOF-801-P Using Neutron Diffraction", "The location of adsorbed water molecules in MOF-801-P was analyzed by neutron powder diffraction data collected at room temperature.

Three primary D", "2", "O adsorption sites, namely site I of cavity T1 as well as sites II and III in cavity T2, were identified (h and I of Figure ", "8", "). These sites were similarly observed in MOF-801-SC. Additional adsorption sites in MOF-801-P were located at the center of the tetrahedral cavities T1 and T2 and labeled as sites IV and V, respectively. For site IV, the excess scattering density resembled a tetrahedron (Figure S11 of ", "SI", "), a direct result of hydrogen-bonding interactions with site I molecules. Therefore, site IV was modeled as two water molecules that are rotated with respect to one another (Figure ", "8", "h) with an average occupancy of 0.33(4). Note that the orientation of the water molecules, as determined by the position of the D atoms, is incompatible with a situation where all five water molecules are present at the same time. This indicates that cavity T1 is occupied simply by the primarily adsorbed molecules in site I, or by three water molecules (i.e., two in site I and the third one in site IV). The presence of water molecules in site I seems to stabilize the presence of site IV molecules through the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions.

As such, we modeled it as rotationally disordered. In this case, the most likely situation is an average combination of all the scenarios already described: (i) molecules only in site II, (ii) a cubic (or incomplete cubic) disposition with molecules in sites II and III, or (iii) trimers with molecules in sites II and V.

We have also evaluated other porous solids, zeolite 13X, MCM-41, M-MOF-74 (M = Mg, Ni, and Co), CAU-6, CAU-10 and the commercially available MOFs Basolite A100, C300 and A300.

One of the most promising technologies in this context is based on the evapn. and consecutive adsorption of coolant liqs., preferably water, under specific conditions.  The efficiency of this process is first and foremost governed by the microporosity, hydrophilicity, and hydrothermal stability of the sorption material employed.

Some simple general principles concerning the design and construction of these frameworks are presented together with reasons for expecting them to show unusual and useful properties.  Two of the simplest conceivable systems of this type are isomorphous Zn(CN)2 and Cd(CN)2 whose structures were reexamd. by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, confirming the earlier description based on powder diffraction data of 2 interpenetrating diamond-related frameworks: cubic, space group P\u203e43m, Z = 2; with a 5.9002(9) \u00c5 (Zn(CN)2) and 6.301(1) \u00c5 (Cd(CN)2); 2 unique metal centers, 1 surrounded tetrahedrally by 4C and the other by 4N donors; MCNM rods linear; Zn-C 1.923(6), Zn-N 2.037(5), Cd-C 2.099(5), Cd-N 2.196(4), C-N 1.150(5) \u00c5 in Zn(CN)2, and 1.162(5) \u00c5 in Cd(CN)2.  The interpenetration of sep. frameworks demonstrated in these archetypal structures is likely to be a major concern in future studies of more complex scaffolding materials.  [N(CH3)4][CuZn(CN)4] was deliberately designed to demonstrate one conceivable way of preventing interpenetration; it is cubic, space group F\u203e43m, with A 11.609(3) \u00c5; Z = 4.  The structure contains a single diamond-related framework with alternating tetrahedral Cu(I) and Zn(II) centers and linear rods that are very likely of the type CuCNZn with bond distances Cu-C 1.877(8) and Zn-N 2.069(15) \u00c5, Z(CH3)4+ ions occupy half the adamantane cavities generated by the framework, the remaining cavities being vacant.

It is tetragonal, space group I\u203e4m2, with a 13.620(2) and c 22.642(2) \u00c5; Z = 2.  The structure contains a diamond-related cationic framework with C\u00b7C6H4\u00b7CN\u00b7Cu rods of length 8.856(2) \u00c5.  The framework is tetragonally elongated along the c axis apparently as a result of nonbonded interactions between the 8 ortho-H atoms around the methane C centers.  There is no interpenetration.  The framework generates very large adamantane-like cavities occupied by disordered C6H5NO2 (at least 7.7 mols. per Cu) together with BF4- ions.  The crystals undergo ready anion exchange.  The material is unusual in that approx. two thirds by vol. of what is undoubtedly a crystal is effectively liq.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character.  However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.  The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A280%3ADC%252BD1cnlvFSqsA%253D%253D&md5=f355e3a0756d112f6ae3148a1e69cd81", "17.

Most notable are metal-org. frameworks (MOFs), in which polyat. inorg. metal-contg. clusters are joined by polytopic linkers. (Although these materials are sometimes referred to as coordination polymers, we prefer to differentiate them, because MOFs are based on strong linkages that yield robust frameworks.) The realization that MOFs could be designed and synthesized in a rational way from mol. building blocks led to the emergence of a discipline that we call reticular chem.MOFs can be represented as a special kind of graph called a periodic net.  Such descriptions date back to the earliest crystallog. studies but have become much more common recently because thousands of new structures and hundreds of underlying nets have been reported.  In the simplest cases (e.g., the structure of diamond), the atoms in the crystal become the vertices of the net, and bonds are the links (edges) that connect them.  In the case of MOFs, polyat. groups act as the vertices and edges of the net.Because of the explosive growth in this area, a need has arisen for a universal system of nomenclature, classification, identification, and retrieval of these topol. structures.  We have developed a system of symbols for the identification of three periodic nets of interest, and this system is now in wide use.  In this Account, we explain the underlying methodol. of assigning symbols and describe the Reticular Chem. Structure Resource (RCSR), in which about 1600 such nets are collected and illustrated in a database that can be searched by symbol, name, keywords, and attributes.  The resource also contains searchable data for polyhedra and layers.The database entries come from systematic enumerations or from known chem. compds. or both.  In the latter case, refs. to occurrences are provided.  We describe some crystallog., topol., and other attributes of nets and explain how they are reported in the database.  We also describe how the database can be used as a tool for the design and structural anal. of new materials.
