In contrast, research focused on potential uses in electronic devices is in its infancy.  Several sensing concepts in which the tailorable chem. of MOFs was used to enhance sensitivity or provide chem. specificity were demonstrated, but in only a few cases are MOFs an integral part of an actual device.  The synthesis of a few elec. conducting MOFs and their known structural flexibility suggest that MOF-based electronic devices exploiting these properties could be constructed.  It is clear, however, that new fabrication methods are required to take advantage of the unique properties of MOFs and extend their use to the realms of electronic circuitry.  In this Concepts article, the authors describe the basic functional elements needed to fabricate electronic devices and summarize the current state of relevant MOF research, and then review recent work in which MOFs serve as active components in electronic devices.  Finally, the authors propose a high-level roadmap for device-related MOF research, the objective of which is to stimulate thinking within the MOF community concerning the development these materials for applications including sensing, photonics, and microelectronics.

The method of effective mass, extended to apply to gradual shifts in energy bands resulting from deformations of the crystal lattice, is used to est. the interaction between electrons of thermal energy and the acoustical modes of vibration.  The mobilities of electrons and holes are thus related to the shifts of the conduction and valence-bond (filled) bands, resp., assocd. with dilations of longitudinal waves.  The theory is checked by comparison of the sum of the shifts of the conduction and valence-bond bands, as derived from the mobilities, with the shift of the energy gap with dilation.  The latter is obtained independently for Si, Ge, and Te from one or more of the processes: (1) the change in intrinsic cond. with pressure, (2) the change in resistance of an n-p junction with pressure, and (3) the variation of intrinsic concn. with temp. and the thermal expansion coeff.

Subsequent sections discuss specific examples of MOF sensors, categorized by method of signal transduction.  Sensors based on MOF photoluminescence are discussed briefly.  The authors have limited the review of luminescence-based sensors to a small no. of recent reports where the porous MOF architecture, or its chem. compn., imparts selective sensing capabilities.  Scintillating MOFs that luminesce in the presence of radioactive analytes are also discussed.  Other signal transduction schemes that use photons include various kinds of optical interferometry, analyte modulation of localized surface plasmon resonance energies, and solvatochromism.
