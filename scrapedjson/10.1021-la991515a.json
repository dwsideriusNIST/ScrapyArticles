However, it should be noticed that for the both sorbates the coal matter swelling (shown as curve 4 in Figures 2 and 4\u22128) is large enough to explain an observed expansion of coals during the sorption process.

Hence, the multiple sorption model is applicable to investigation of expansion and squealer phenomena.

It means that the BET equation is not an adequate description of the sorption (adsorption) in the studied systems; however, MSM and LBET isotherms (eqs 6 and 10) may be well approximated by the DR model.

Sorption isotherms were measured by gas chromatog. at infinite diln. of water in starch and by isothermal and isosteric sorption expts. in an extended concn. and temp. range in which the biopolymer behaves either as a brittle glass or as a rubbery melt.  A max. value of the isothermal activity coeff. of water is obsd. at a compn. corresponding to the glass transitions measured by calorimetry.  Therefore, the partial derivs. of the activity coeff. of water with respect to concn. and temp. are pos. in glasses and neg. in melts.  A transition from sigmoidal to Flory type sorption is estd. to occur at 175\u00b0, which is lower than the glass transition of dry starch.  The distribution of water mols. in glasses and melts is analyzed with the Kirkwood theory of solns.  In glasses, water shows large neg. excluded vols. typical of an antiplasticizer, as reflected also in the d. increase obsd. at low water concns.  In melts, water shows pos. excluded vols. typical of a plasticizer having recovered its motional freedom restricted in the glassy state.  Up to 80\u00b0, the self-clustering functions of water in melts diverge at higher water contents.  These functions only take finite values above this temp. once a full melting of the starch-starch hydrogen bond interaction has occurred.  The sigmoidal water sorption isotherms are analyzed with a new explicit relationship combining the generalized Freundlich adsorption model and the Flory model of polymer solns.  A restricted translational and rotational freedom is predicted for the adsorption water, and a clustering tendency is predicted for the soln. water.  The Freundlich-Flory sorption model provides a consistent description of the solvation, the swelling, and the dissoln. of hydrophilic polymer glasses in a solvent like water whereas the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller model is only phys. meaningful for the adsorption of nonsolvents such as O or N gases.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaK1cXisVSju7w%253D&md5=a97bd1a738dddbf9eda483010a54a4cb", " ", " "], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00009.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00010.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/langd5/2000/langd5.2000.16.issue-12/la991515a/production/images/small/la991515af00011.gif\">"]}
