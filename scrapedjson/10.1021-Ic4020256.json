Metal-org. frameworks (MOFs) have recently attracted intense research interest because of their permanent porous structures, large surface areas, and potential applications as novel adsorbents.  The recent progress in adsorption-based CO2 capture by MOFs is reviewed and summarized in this crit. review.  CO2 adsorption in MOFs has been divided into two sections, adsorption at high pressures and selective adsorption at approx. atm. pressures.  Keys to CO2 adsorption in MOFs at high pressures and low pressures are summarized to be pore vols. of MOFs, and heats of adsorption, resp.  Many MOFs have high CO2 selectivities over N2 and CH4.  Water effects on CO2 adsorption in MOFs are presented and compared with benchmark zeolites.  In addn., strategies appeared in the literature to enhance CO2 adsorption capacities and/or selectivities in MOFs have been summarized into three main categories, catenation and interpenetration, chem. bonding enhancement, and electrostatic force involvement.  Besides the advantages, two main challenges of using MOFs in CO2 capture, the cost of synthesis and the stability toward water vapor, have been analyzed and possible solns. and path forward have been proposed to address the two challenges as well (150 refs.).", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC38XivFWlsbo%253D&md5=0ff1149f94a6e21a49a6591786eac483", "(b) ", "Suh", ", ", "M.

MOFs have versatile structures, high surface areas and high pore vols. - they can be regarded as good candidate materials for H storage.  There are many MOFs that have high H adsorption capacities at low temps., typically at 77 or 87 K.  The highest H storage capacity reported so far is 99.5 mg/g at 77K and 56 bar for NU-100.  However, the high H capacities of MOFs at cryogenic temps. decrease as the temp. increases to room temp.  This is because the H adsorption in MOFs is weak physisorption and the interaction energies between the H mols. and frameworks are low.  To develop MOFs as H storage materials that meet the U.S.DOE targets for an on-board hydrogen system, a serious challenge is still present in the design and synthesis of the MOF materials.  We may expect that highly stable MOFs having a large surface area and pore vol., together with many open metal sites and embedded catalysts for hydrogen spillover, would provide some pos. results for H storage at ambient temp.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhs1GlsbjM&md5=dd1f08beefd27cce77d88e466551c1af", "(c) ", "Zhang", ", ", "Z.

Reaction of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid (H2L) and zinc nitrate in DMF yielded a dense 2-dimensional network, Zn3L3(DMF)2 (1), featuring Zn in both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination environments connected by trans-stilbene links.  Similar reaction in N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) at higher temps., followed by replacement of solvent in workup, resulted in a porous, 3-dimensional framework structure, Zn4OL3\u00b7(DMF)(CHCl3) (2).  This framework consists of two interpenetrating cubic lattices, each featuring basic Zn carboxylate vertexes joined by trans-stilbene, analogous to the isoreticular MOF (IRMOF) series.  The optical properties of both 1 and 2 correlate with the local ligand environments obsd. in the crystal structures.  Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements reveal that the stilbene linkers in the dense structure 1 exhibit a small degree of interchromophore coupling.  In contrast, the stilbenoid units in 2 display very little interaction in this low-d. 3-dimensional framework, with excitation and emission spectra characteristic of monomeric stilbenes, similar to the dicarboxylic acid in dil. soln.  In both cases, the rigidity of the stilbene linker increases upon coordination to the inorg. units through inhibition of torsion about the central ethylene bond, resulting in luminescent crystals with increased emission lifetimes compared to solns. of trans-stilbene.

All the coordination polymers were characterized by elemental anal., IR spectroscopy and x-ray single-crystal diffraction.  Coordination polymers 1-11 exhibit two different structural types: the 2-D structure of coordination polymers 1-2 are a (6,3)-connected hcb network, coordination polymers 3-11 appear as a 3-D diamond structure with 66-network topol.  Coordination polymers 12-16 are 3-D structures constructed from the bridged carboxyl group of IMDC3-, in which IMDC3- bridged the DNA-like double-helix line and the triple-helix line, intertwined and connected into a 1-D chain and then conformed into a 3-D structure along the ab plane.  The different structures of the two dicarboxylate ligands (oxalic acid as a flexible ligand and imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid as a rigid planar ligand) were described and discussed.  Furthermore, the luminescent properties in the visible region and the fluorescence lifetimes of the coordination polymers exhibited the characteristic transitions of the corresponding lanthanide ions.  Coordination polymers 5 and 7 have long solid-state fluorescence lifetimes of 824.84 and 733.87 \u03bcs, resp.  The NIR emission spectra of the Nd (3), Sm (4 and 12), Dy (8 and 16) and Yb (11) coordination polymers in the solid-state were measured.  The singlet excited state (30,842 cm-1 for oxalic acid, 32,258 cm-1 for H3IMDC) and the lowest triplet state energy level (23,753 cm-1 for oxalic acid and 22,371 cm-1 for H3IMDC) of the H2ox and H3IMDC ligand were calcd. on the basis of the UV-visible absorbance edges of the ligand and the phosphorescence spectrum of the Gd(III) coordination polymers 6 and 14 at 77 K, resp.  The relation between the lowest triplet state energy level of the two dicarboxylate ligands and lowest resonance energy levels of the Sm(III), Eu(III), Tb(III) and Dy(III) ions were described and discussed.

In addn. to identifying useful innovations that have come into general use through their implementation in SHELX, a crit. anal. is presented of the less-successful features, missed opportunities and desirable improvements for future releases of the software.  An attempt is made to understand how a program originally designed for photog. intensity data, punched cards and computers over 10000 times slower than an av. modern personal computer has managed to survive for so long.  SHELXL is the most widely used program for small-mol. refinement and SHELXS and SHELXD are often employed for structure soln. despite the availability of objectively superior programs.  SHELXL also finds a niche for the refinement of macromols. against high-resoln. or twinned data; SHELXPRO acts as an interface for macromol. applications.  SHELXC, SHELXD and SHELXE are proving useful for the exptl. phasing of macromols., esp. because they are fast and robust and so are often employed in pipelines for high-throughput phasing.
