If we take into account the UiO-66 content of the composites and recalculate the surface area and microporous volume using only the mass of MOF on the samples, we obtain higher values (Table ", "1", ") and see that these parameters are reduced to about 60% and 55% of the initial value, for composite A and B, respectively.

The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centers, linked together with a variety of polyat. org. bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mech. stability.

However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications.  Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect.  New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare.  Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability.  The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates.  The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications.

Regarding the xylene isomers, the adsorption of the bulkier ortho-xylene (oX) is favored compared to its homologs.  The structural similarity between MOF UiO-66 and zeolite MCM-22 suggests that the reverse shape selectivity obsd. in the adsorption of hexane and xylene isomers might be attributed to the rotational freedom of the mols. inside the small cavities.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3cXhsFegsrnK&md5=d5c3c28bf697bef2665cf84ca858c672", "17.

Adsorption isotherms of nitrogen and toluene were detd. to evaluate the influence of the supporting process in the adsorption capacity of the different adsorbent materials.  The results indicate that the activated carbons in form of pellets presented the best results with a decrease of about 20% in the nitrogen adsorption capacity but maintaining the same toluene adsorption capacity.  The inorg. adsorbents presented a decrease of about 73% for the zeolite and 97% for the pillared clay in the nitrogen adsorption capacity and also a pronounced decrease in the toluene adsorption capacity.  Two materials, one activated carbon and one zeolite, with different particle sizes were supported in the polyurethane foam.  The decrease in the adsorption capacity of nitrogen and toluene was more pronounced when solids with smaller particles were used.  This was an indication that the decrease in the adsorption capacity is related to the impregnation of the surface of the solid particles by the polyurethane during the synthesis of the composite material, which was obsd. by SEM.
