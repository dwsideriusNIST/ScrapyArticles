Optical waveguide amplifiers based on polymer materials offer a low-cost alternative for inorg. waveguide amplifiers.  Due to the fact that their refractive index is similar to that of std. optical fibers, they can be easily coupled to existing fibers with low coupling losses.  Doping the polymer with rare earth ions that yield optical gain is not straightforward, as the rare earth salts are poorly sol. in the polymer matrix.  This review focuses on 2 different approaches to dope a polymer waveguide with rare earth ions.  The 1st approach is based on org. cage-like complexes that encapsulate the rare earth ion and are designed to provide coordination sites to bind the rare earth ion and to shield it from the surrounding matrix.  These complexes also offer the possibility of attaching a highly absorbing antenna group, which increases the pump efficiency significantly.  The 2nd approach to fabricate rare earth-doped polymer waveguides is to combine the good properties of SiO2 as a host for rare earth ions with the easy processing of polymers.  This is done by doping polymers with Er-doped SiO2 colloidal spheres.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD38XisVersbo%253D&md5=58a8a49434fe21d8cfe3437ac57d3aab", " ", " ", "(6)", "\u2002", "Wang, H.

These are the longest reported lifetimes for the Er3+ ion in a simple org. chelate.  These remarkable improvements in luminescence efficiency and excited-state lifetime represent a significant step forward in the design and fabrication of near-IR (NIR)-emitting mol. devices for communications, sensing, and anal. detection.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2cXhtFCiu7jF&md5=7c3f6ea226a6358147469a70afc9d633", " ", " ", "(12)", "\u2002", "Rosi, N.

Some basic nets derived from linking simple rods (helixes and ladders) are then enumerated.  The authors demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of rod secondary building units in the design and synthesis of metal-org. frameworks (MOFs).  Accordingly, the authors present the prepn., characterization, and crystal structures of 14 new MOFs (named MOF-69A-C and MOF-70-80) of 12 different structure types, belonging to rod packing motifs, and show how their structures are related to basic nets.  The MOFs reported herein are of polytopic carboxylates and contain one of Zn, Pb, Co, Cd, Mn, or Tb.  The inclusion properties of the most open members are presented as evidence that MOF structures with rod building blocks can indeed be designed to have permanent porosity and rigid architectures.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD2MXjtFGmtg%253D%253D&md5=0ad22a135cba65fb519eae17258dc4c8", " ", " "], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2006/inocaj.2006.45.issue-22/ic060568u/production/images/small/ic060568uf1.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2006/inocaj.2006.45.issue-22/ic060568u/production/images/small/ic060568uf00001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2006/inocaj.2006.45.issue-22/ic060568u/production/images/small/ic060568uf00002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2006/inocaj.2006.45.issue-22/ic060568u/production/images/small/ic060568uf00003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2006/inocaj.2006.45.issue-22/ic060568u/production/images/small/ic060568uf00004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2006/inocaj.2006.45.issue-22/ic060568u/production/images/small/ic060568uf00005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/inocaj/2006/inocaj.2006.45.issue-22/ic060568u/production/images/small/ic060568uf00006.gif\">"]}
