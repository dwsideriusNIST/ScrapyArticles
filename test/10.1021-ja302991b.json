The transitions are governed by a combination of factors, including energetic, kinetic, and steric aspects with, however, transition pressures becoming increasingly lower with increasing no. of C atoms on the adsorbate.  This can be rationalized in terms of increased host-guest interactions.  Mol. modeling gives insights into the adsorption mechanism, in terms of the arrangement of the mols. within the pores, allowing the rationalization of the different amts. of n-nonane adsorbed in relation to the other mols.  Finally, the arrangement of the mols. within the pores also plays a role in the kinetics of the adsorption process, which shows that the C6 (n-hexane) mols. require more time to reach a state of static equil. than the C9 (n-nonane) mols., due to their greater degree of freedom resulting from their alignment along the pores.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC3MXhtFSmtL%252FP&md5=4b8f80cfd8ff7812819235a7a4c3e147", "33.

The results of adsorption measurements on 1, using probing gas mols. of alc.

To further clarify these adsorption/desorption behaviors, selecting nitroterephthalate (bdc-NO2), bromoterephthalate (bdc-Br), and 2,5-dichloroterephthalate (bdc-Cl2) as substituted dicarboxylate ligands, isomorphous jungle-gym-type porous coordination polymers, {[Zn2(bdc-NO2)2(dabco)]\u00b7solvents}n (2 \u220b solvents), {[Zn2(bdc-Br)2(dabco)]\u00b7solvents}n (3 \u220b solvents), and {[Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2(dabco)]\u00b7solvents}n (4 \u220b solvents), were synthesized and characterized by single-crystal x-ray analyses.

Considering the substituent effects and adsorbate sizes, the H bonds, which are triggers for two-step adsorption, are formed between adsorbates and carboxylate groups at the corners in the pores, inducing wide pores to become narrow pores.

The isocoumarin ring system is formed via Heck coupling of a pyruvate synthon II with a terephthalic acid deriv. III followed by an intramol. acid-catalyzed cyclization.  The requisite terephthalic acid precursor is generated by carboxylation of catechol, desymmetrization of the arom. ring by iodination, selective ester hydroylisis of the least hindered ester group, and subsequent redn. and protection of the resultant acid function.  The isocoumarin deriv. that was produced is an appropriate precursor for the synthesis of \u03b3-rubromycin, purpuromycin, and heliquinomycin.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXjtlSksL0%253D&md5=4153e2e25d29c87e28ef78071db27a22"], "figures": ["<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0014.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0015.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0008.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0001.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0002.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0003.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0004.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0005.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0006.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0007.gif\">", "<img alt=\"figure\" src=\"/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/2012/jacsat.2012.134.issue-22/ja302991b/production/images/small/ja-2012-02991b_0009.gif\">"]}
