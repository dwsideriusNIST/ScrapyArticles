Although a number of frameworks are available for describing the adsorption phenomenon, the Ono\u2013Kondo (OK) lattice model offers several practical advantages in modeling supercritical, high-pressure adsorption systems. In a recent work, a generalized Ono\u2013Kondo model was developed for predicting pure-gas adsorption on activated carbons and coals. The goal of the present work is to utilize the pure-component, generalized OK model to predict, a priori, the mixture adsorption of coalbed gases. Specifically, the OK model parameters obtained from pure-gas adsorption were used to predict mixed-gas adsorption for selected multicomponent adsorption systems. In addition, the ultimate correlative capabilities of the OK model for mixed-gas adsorption were also investigated by using binary interaction parameters.Traditional modeling of mixed-gas adsorption typically involves the equilibrium gas-phase mole fractions as required model input. However, the experimental gas-phase molar fractions are generally not available for coalbed reservoir simulation studies. Therefore, in this work, an iteration function method is developed for mixed-gas adsorption that does not rely on measurements of gas-phase molar fractions and, therefore, is ideally suited for use in coalbed reservoir simulators. The results indicate that the OK model can be used to (a) ", " binary gas adsorption within 2 times the experimental uncertainties, on average, based on pure-component model parameters alone and (b) ", " total and individual adsorptions to within their expected experimental uncertainties with the use of one binary interaction parameter."], "text": ["Top of Page", "Abstract", "Introduction", "Ono\u2013Kondo Lattice Model for Mixture Adsorption", "Iteration Function Method (IFM)", "Case Studies", "Summary", "References", "Introduction", "Our recent studies have indicated that the Ono\u2013Kondo (OK) lattice model has the capability to represent high-pressure adsorption data for pure-gas adsorbates on activated carbon and coal adsorbents.", "(1)", " A newly developed generalized model was also presented in an earlier work for predicting high-pressure, pure-gas adsorption on activated carbons and coals.

Although several frameworks are available for describing this adsorption phenomenon, the Ono-Kondo (OK) lattice model offers several practical advantages in modeling supercrit., high-pressure adsorption systems.  The authors evaluated the Ono-Kondo (OK) lattice model for correlating high-pressure, supercrit. adsorption encountered in CBM recovery and CO2 sequestration.  Specifically, the parameters of the OK model were optimized to obtain reliable representation of pure-gas adsorption on carbon adsorbents.  The results were used to develop generalized model parameters, expressed in terms of gas properties and adsorbent characterization which include the temp. dependence of the OK model parameters.  The OK monolayer model appears effective in modeling pure-gas adsorption on carbon matrixes.  The model can represent the adsorption isotherms on activated carbons and coals with \u223c3.6% av. abs. deviation (AAD), which is within the expected exptl. uncertainties of the data.  The generalized model can predict the adsorption isotherms on activated carbon with \u223c7%AAD.  Also, generalized model parameters detd. from isotherms of a single gas can be used to predict the adsorption isotherms of other gases.

The newly developed generalized model is capable of predicting the adsorption of pure and mixed gases on coals within three times the expected exptl. uncertainties, on av.  The model was further validated by comparison with an external data set comprised of CO2 adsorption isotherms on 27 diverse coals.  Results indicate that, on av., the SLD-PR generalized model provided a priori predictions of the CO2 adsorption data on the 27 coals with an av. abs. percent deviation of 12%, based solely on coal characterization information for these coals.

The system was used to measure CO2-induced swelling in three Australian bituminous coals at temps. between 25 and 55\u00b0 and pressures up to 15 MPa.  All three coals showed similar behavior, with swelling increasing as a function of pressure up to \u223c8 to 10 MPa, after which no further increase in swelling was obsd.  The max. volumetric swelling was between \u223c1.7 and 1.9%, even in liq. CO2.  Significant anisotropy was obsd.; swelling in the plane perpendicular to the bedding plane was always substantially higher than in the parallel plane.  The swelling in these coals was completely reversible with each sample returning to its original dimensions after the gas was removed, even after multiple exposures.  Temp. did not directly affect the max. amt. of swelling, however, the swelling tended to occur at lower pressures with decreasing temp.  Expressing the swelling as a function of gas d. rather than gas pressure showed that swelling was independent of temp.; in all cases the swelling curves were identical.  Swelling could be well represented by a modified Dubinin-Radushkevich model which was used previously to describe gas adsorption on coal.  Volumetric swelling data for two of the coals were combined with gas adsorption results previously measured for these coals.  Swelling was roughly proportional to the amt. of CO2 adsorbed up to intermediate pressures, but at high pressures, the relation was no longer linear; adsorption continued to increase but swelling did not.  The swelling data were used to correct the adsorption isotherm measured for these coals, assuming that the vol. occupied by the coal was inaccessible to gas and increased in proportion to volumetric swelling.  At pressures up to \u223c5 MPa, the effect of correction for swelling on the adsorption value was negligible but at higher pressures, the vol. changes due to the swelling of the coal resulted in an increased measured excess adsorption.  At 15 MPa the cor. excess sorption was \u223c30% greater than the uncorrected value.  Correction for swelling had little effect on the calcd. sorption capacity of the coal or the heat of sorption (using the modified Dubinin-Radushkevich equation) but had strong effects on the term representing dissoln. of carbon dioxide into the coal.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD1cXhs1Krtrc%253D&md5=3a916bfde88021a560fe8784c79fc1bd", "25.

Because swelling of the coal org. matrix in the presence of adsorbing gases is a well-known phenomenon and because traditional isotherm models assume a rigid structure, an adsorption isotherm equation was derived to account for the vol. effects which may occur when an adsorbate alters the structure of an adsorbent.  The equation, which accounts for vol. change in general, was applied to the particular example of CO2 adsorption on coal.  In some cases, significantly better fits were obtained when the adsorption data were fit to the swelling-modified model.  The modified model partitions the exptl. detd. adsorption into a surface adsorption term, which is important at lower pressure, and a rectilinear term, related to vol. effects, which is important at higher pressures.  This is particularly significant to the problem of CO2 sequestration in coal seams where high pressures of CO2 will be used.", " >> More from SciFinder ", "\u00ae", "https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&resolution=options&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3sXotVGhtrs%253D&md5=51751f7ff2126b6cc72ae7e819a414dd", "26.
