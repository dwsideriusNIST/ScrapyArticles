Ethylene is usually obtained by steam cracking and thermal decomposition of ethane. These products are mixtures of ethylene (main component), un-cracked ethane and other hydrocarbons. Therefore, ethylene separation from the other hydrocarbons, especially ethane, is necessary. The pressure of gas mixture is about 2000\u00a0kPa and temperature of 298\u00a0K and ethylene mole fraction in gas phase is nearly about 0.5\u20130.6. Currently, this process is done by cryogenic distillation; but due to the small difference in ethylene and ethane volatility, it needs high pressure units. The relative volatility of the current system is 1.4 to 1.6 at temperature range of 224 to 295\u00a0K and a total pressure of 1 to 24.3\u00a0bar. Consequently, if traditional distillation is used, more than 70 theoretical plates are needed when polymer-grade ethylene is required. This is an energy consuming process that costs more than 70\u00a0% of overall ethylene purification process cost (Anson et al. ", "2008", "). The adsorption process seems to be the most attractive alternative because of the maturity of the technology, the development of adsorbent manufacturing, low cost and low energy consumption (but highly efficient) gas separation systems. However, adsorption equilibrium data are necessary information for designing a separation process on the basis of adsorption. With the presentation of new industrial adsorbents, it seems to be indispensable to find out their properties for separation systems. Commercial zeolites have been found to be extremely efficient for olefin/paraffin separations (Triebe et al. ", "1996", "; Grande et al. ", "2002", "; Mofarahi et al. ", "2005", "). Several groups have applied synthetic commercial zeolites to the separation of ethylene/ethane. Bezus et\u00a0al.

However, none of these processes has confirmed to be a practical alternative to the old processes such as cryogenic distillation.", "Zeolite 5A is commonly used for gas separation by size exclusion. The size cage of calcium zeolite 5A has an internal volume of 776\u00a0\u00c5, formed by a cubic lattice of sodalite cages.

In this work, the data of pure component adsorption were studied according to vacancy solution theory and binary adsorption data were predicted by VST models.", "In this study, a volumetric adsorption apparatus, which was designed and tested in the Persian Gulf University (Mofarahi and Seyyedi ", "2009", "), was used to study ethylene/ethane separation behavior on zeolite 5A adsorbent (manufactured by Zeochem Company). The adsorption equilibrium isotherms were measured for pure ethylene, ethane and their binary mixture (20\u00a0%, 50\u00a0%, and 80\u00a0%) of ethylene at temperature of 283, 303 and 323\u00a0K and pressure of 0 to 950\u00a0kPa. The total amount of adsorbed ethylene and ethane mixture was directly measured in the experiments, and the individual adsorbed amount of each component was predicted by thermodynamic modeling. Model constants of VST are determined by pure adsorption isotherms and then applied to predict adsorption of mixtures. One can obtain individual adsorption amounts of components in the mixture as well as ethylene selectivity using the model prediction. Then, the influence of temperature, pressure, and composition in gas phase on selectivity will be discussed. Furthermore, the isosteric heats of adsorption of ethylene and ethane over zeolite 5A were estimated and compared. Also, the thermodynamic consistency tests between pure and binary gas adsorption systems were discussed.", "2 ", "Theory", "To quantify single-component adsorption equilibria, vacancy solution theory is considered in this work. An isotherm model based on VST is capable to describe real phase behavior (Suwanayuen and Danner ", "1980a", "; Suwanayuen and Danner ", "1980b", ").

It consists of an adsorption cell, a loading cell, a circulation pump and a volumetric system to introduce and measure the gases admitted in the circuit. The loading and adsorption cell, circulation pump and all connections are all made up of stainless steel. The total amount of gas introduced into the system is measured by appropriate pressure, temperature, and volume. The temperature uncertainty of the thermocouple is \u00b10.1\u00a0K. the pressure uncertainty of the pressure transmitter is \u00b10.05\u00a0kPa. The temperature and pressure were recorded at constant intervals with a recorder (Logoscreen 50, Jumo). During measurement, the adsorption cell was immersed in a water bath (MC 12, Julabo Tech.) where the temperature was maintained at \u00b10.02\u00a0K via a refrigeration circulator. The volumes of the adsorption cell, loading cell, and dead volumes were measured using helium gas. A\u00a0vacuum pump was used to remove gaseous impurities from the system. The vacuum pomp was vacuumbrand RE6 model with maximum flow rate of 5.7\u20136.8\u00a0m", "3", "/hr and 0.05\u00a0mbar vacuum level. The first regeneration of the adsorbent was in an oven overnight (300\u00a0", "\u2218", "C for 6\u00a0h) under a vacuum of less than 0.05\u00a0mbar.

When the cell was stabilized, the total amount of gas introduced into the system was measured by appropriate pressure, temperature, and volume. After reaching equilibrium the common pressure and temperature were recorded. The adsorption equilibrium state was considered to be reached when the temperatures and the pressures per cell were constant. In other words, at equilibrium state, pressure and temperature of loading cell and reference cell became constant after an hour of pressurizing and change of pressure and temperature is not more than 0.05\u00a0kPa and 0.1\u00a0K, respectively. Temperatures and pressures before and after the adsorption equilibrium state were recorded. The experiment was conducted, on a continuous basis, at pressures up to 950\u00a0kPa. During the experiments a circulation pump was used for gas mixing and circulating. The amount of adsorbed gas was calculated, from the temperature and pressure, before and after the adsorption equilibrium state using a mass balance. This balance was derived from the generalized equation of state before and after adsorption equilibrium. Those measurements are cited elsewhere (Mofarahi and Seyyedi ", "2009", "). The measurements were repeated several times for each isotherm in order to verify the data accuracy.", "4 ", "Result and discussion", "Pure adsorption isotherm", "Adsorption isotherms of pure ethylene and ethane measured at three temperatures (283, 303 and 323\u00a0K) are presented in Tables\u00a0", "2", " and\u00a0", "3", ", respectively. The adsorption isotherm data were well correlated by the VST model. The correlated parameters and error of analysis are given in Tables\u00a0", "4", " and\u00a0", "5", ". The results in Tables\u00a0", "4", " and\u00a0", "5", " illustrate good capability of the VST model to describe the pure ethylene and ethane isotherms. Correlation results of modeling show that the obtained average error (AAD %) is less than 7\u00a0% for pure ethylene and less than 11\u00a0% for pure ethane. A\u00a0comparison of the experimental data with the correlation results for pure ethylene and ethane adsorption isotherms is illustrated in Figs.\u00a0", "1", " and\u00a0", "2", ", respectively. As can be observed, some deviations between experimental data and correlation results are seen especially in high pressures. These figures show that the equilibrium loading on zeolite 5A on ethylene is higher than ethane at all temperatures. In particular, this difference is much higher at low temperatures. Also, the curve for ethylene is more rectangular shaped than the curve for ethane, indicating a stronger interaction between ethylene and zeolite 5A than between ethane and zeolite 5A. Corresponding to the Brunauer classification of isotherms, ethane and ethylene isotherms closely resemble to type\u00a0I isotherms. Physical monolayer adsorption of the type\u00a0I isotherms occurs in microporous materials where the saturation limit corresponds to complete filling of the micropores. In other words, pore sizes of zeolite particles are not much larger than the molecular diameter of the adsorbate (the kinetic diameter of ethylene and ethane is 4.163 & 4.443\u00a0\u00c5, respectively) (Yang ", "1986", "). This shows that the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions are more significant than adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. The ethylene and ethane adsorption capacity of zeolite 5A reveal most of its swing capacity in the pressure region of 1 to 250\u00a0kPa. At this point, the comparison of different adsorbents can be discussed. Zeolite 5A has more adsorption swing capacity for ethylene than the other interesting adsorbents such as ETS-10 (Al-Baghli and Loughlin ", "2005", "; Shi et al. ", "2010", ") and ETS-4 (Anson et al. ", "2010", ") with different cation structures. The adsorption swing capacity of zeolite 5A for ethylene was more similar to adsorbents such as zeolite 4A (Perez and Armenta ", "2010", ") and 13X (Danner and Choi ", "1978", "). It is also important to mention that high capacity for the desired component is an important asset in olefin/paraffin separations by PSA processes.

This trend has been experimentally verified by Al-Baghli and Loughlin (", "2006", "). It seems quadrupole interactions play an important role at high pressures because of the great difference in ethylene (0.48\u00a0\u00c5", "3", ") and ethane (0.27\u00a0\u00c5", "3", ") quadrupole moment.

An excellent fit has been obtained using the VST model for pure adsorption data. The correlated pure component parameters were appropriately applied to predict binary adsorption data. The binary adsorption errors obtained from the predictions are less than 7\u00a0% in all cases. The isosteric heat of adsorption was estimated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and pure component data. The adsorption selectivity was predicted using pure component adsorption isotherm data and the VST model. At a fixed pressure and temperature, prediction results show that ethylene selectivity increases when the ethylene composition of the gas phase decreases. It also indicated that selectivity increases with pressure. Furthermore, prediction results show that the lower the temperature at a specified pressure, the greater the ethylene separation by zeolite 5A. Given its high adsorption capacity and reasonable selectivity for ethylene in comparisons with other remarkable adsorbents, zeolite 5A can be used for ethylene/ethane separation by adsorption technology especially in pressure swing adsorption processes. Finally, a thermodynamic consistency test was performed for binary data adsorption accuracy and shows adequate accuracy of the data."], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\"><a
