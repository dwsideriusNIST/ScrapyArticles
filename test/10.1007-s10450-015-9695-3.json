Energy intensive cryogenic distillation process using large number of trays is the common method for separation of light olefin/paraffin as their relative volatility lies between 1.0 and 1.1 at temperatures of 244\u2013327\u00a0K and total pressures of 1.7\u201322\u00a0bar (Da Silva and Rodrigues ", "1999", "). For instance, ethene/ethane separation is achieved at about\u201425\u00a0\u00b0C and 320 psig (2.306\u00a0MPa) within a column with more than 100 trays, and propene/propane distillation column works at \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C and 30 psig (0.308\u00a0MPa)(Rege et al.

An error in the isotherm parameters can cause a large error in the multicomponent computations (Do ", "1998", "). Thus, in the first step, a reasonable and accurate isotherm data should be selected or estimated. For zeolite 4A, Grande et al.

This one point is not adequate for obtaining the isotherm model. Thus, only Langmuir affinity parameter (b) can be taken if the saturation adsorption capacity of propane is known. In this regard, as the saturation adsorption capacity of propene is known and also propene and propane liquid densities at high pressures are almost the same, saturation adsorption capacity of propane is assumed to have the same value that reported for propene.

(", "2009", ") are utilized in this paper.", "Experimental adsorption data for ITQ-12, ITQ-32 and DDR are extracted from the works of Guti\u00e9rrez et al. (", "2010", "), Palomino et al. (", "2007", ") and Gascon et al. (", "2008", "), respectively, and then fitted with an appropriate model.", "3 ", "Results and discussion", "Binary equilibrium adsorption of a mixture of propane and propene with different gas phase compositions are obtained using IAST model. In the first step, the effect of binary mixture composition on the equilibrium adsorption selectivity is investigated. In this regard, all calculations are made at 100\u00a0kPa and the temperatures that the isotherms are reported. The results are plotted in Figs.\u00a0", "3", " and ", "4", " against propene mole fractions in the gas phase for adsorbents having selectivity below and above 20, respectively. These figures show that all adsorbents except SAPO-34 zeolite have higher selectivities at higher pressures. Thus, the higher the gas phase mole fraction the higher selectivity that can be achieved. Figure\u00a0", "3", " reveals that the adsorbents with selectivities less than 20 are in the following order: Si-CHA\u00a0>\u00a013X\u00a0>\u00a0Mg-MOF-74\u00a0>\u00a0Ni-MOF-74\u00a0>\u00a0CuBTC\u00a0>\u00a05A\u00a0>\u00a0ITQ-3. According to Fig.\u00a0", "4", " (i.e. 13X and Mg-MOF-74), usually the selectivity decreases with increase in temperature. Therefore, it should be noted that the selectivity of ITQ-3 at 298\u00a0K may be higher than the others like 5A and CuBTC. Additionally, Si-CHA and ITQ-3 selectivities don\u2019t change with the variation of propene mole fraction. This may be attributed to the procedure described before for estimation of Langmuir isotherm parameters; i.e. only one equilibrium point exists in the literature. Figure\u00a0", "4", " obviously shows the supreme capability of DDR zeolite to separate propene from propane because it has a very high equilibrium selectivity, i.e. higher than 1000. However, IAST modeling of DDR has been performed at a higher temperature than the other zeolites with higher selectivities. Additionally, Bae et al. (Bae et al. ", "2012", ") synthesized Co-MOF-74 which has a very high selectivity than the other MOF-74\u00a0s (Ni-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74). Its selectivity for an equimolar mixture of propene/propane is reported to be 46 with adsorption capacity of 6.8\u00a0mmol/g at 298\u00a0K and 100\u00a0kPa (Bae et al. ", "2012", "). Figure\u00a0", "4", " along with the work of Bae et al.

So, IAST modeling was done for a 50/50 mixture of propene/propane at different pressures in the range of 1-100\u00a0kPa. The results are graphically presented in Figs.\u00a0", "5", " and ", "6", " for adsorbents having selectivity below and above 20, respectively. All adsorbents show an increase in the selectivity with increase in pressure except for SAPO-34 and MOFs (Mg-MOF-74, Ni-MOF-74 and CuBTC). Pressure increase has totally adverse effect on SAPO-34 selectivity while MOFs generally show a minimum at lower pressures.", "Open image in new window", "Fig.\u00a05", "Propene/propane equilibrium adsorption selectivity versus pressure for adsorbents with low selectivities", "Open image in new window", "Fig.\u00a06", "Propene/propane equilibrium adsorption selectivity versus pressure for adsorbents with high selectivities", "3.1 ", "Equilibrium adsorption selectivity versus capacity", "From economical and operational view points, not only the selectivity of adsorbent is important but also the adsorption capacity may take a crucial role in the selection for adsorption based processes. In other words, an adsorbent is suitable which has higher selectivity and capacity, simultaneously. In the previous section, only the selectivity, the inherent capability, of zeolites and MOFs are compared and the equilibrium adsorption amount was not considered. Figure\u00a0", "7", " shows simultaneously the selectivities and adsorption amounts of adsorbents at 100\u00a0kPa for 50/50 binary mixture. This figure indicates that MOFs have higher adsorption capacities. On the other hand, zeolites DDR, ITQ-32 separate propene from propane with high selectivities. Obviously, it can be stated that the higher selectivity is gained in the cost of decrease in the adsorption capacity. For instance, DDR selectivity is almost 100 times higher than that of CuBTC or Mg-MOF-74 while its adsorption capacity is lower than them by a factor of about 10. This figure is useful for selection of adsorbents, however, the selection of suitable sorbent needs some economic considerations where the importance of capacity or selectivity should be taken into account. But, generally, it may be stated that the MOFs especially M-MOF-74 and CuBTC are appropriate for a process where the adsorption capacity is more pronounced. On the other hand, DDR, ITQ-32 zeolites are suitable for membrane applications where the adsorption selectivity is much more important than capacity.", "Open image in new window", "Fig.\u00a07", "Propene/propane equilibrium selectivity versus amount adsorbed at 298\u00a0K unless otherwise stated", "4 ", "Conclusions", "Binary adsorption of propene/propane mixtures using IAST model led to evaluate the capability of various microporous adsorbents (zeolites and MOFs) that have been utilized in the literature. Figure\u00a0", "7", " may be a very useful graph that can be utilized for selecting the suitable adsorbent for a specified process. The results revealed that MOFs have higher adsorption capacity (~8\u00a0mmol/g) with a propene/propane equilibrium selectivity of about 10\u201312 at 100\u00a0kPa and 298\u00a0K for a 50/50 binary mixture. On the other hand, all-silica DDR zeolite showed a very high selectivity of more than 1000 with adsorption capacity of about 0.8\u00a0mmol/g. Additionally, the other silica zeolite, i.e. ITQ-32, is an alternative that has a selectivity of 230 and adsorption capacity of about 1.2\u00a0mmol/g. Generally, it may be said that the MOFs especially M-MOF-74 and CuBTC with higher capacity are appropriate choices for bulk separations based on equilibrium adsorption. On the other hand, DDR, ITQ-32, SAPO-34 and 4A zeolite are proper candidates for membrane applications where the adsorption selectivity is more important."], "figures": ["<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO9\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig1_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig1_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO10\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig2_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig2_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO11\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig3_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig3_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO12\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig4_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig4_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO13\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig5_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig5_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO14\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig6_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig6_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>", "<div class=\"MediaObject\" id=\"MO15\"><a href=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig7_HTML.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"u-screenreader-only\">Open image in new window</span><img src=\"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10450-015-9695-3/MediaObjects/10450_2015_9695_Fig7_HTML.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></div>"]}
